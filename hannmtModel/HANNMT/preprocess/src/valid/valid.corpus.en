No other evidence.
Suddenly, this appeared.
And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution, by geology, here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true.
It's a great 19th century moment.
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true, hurrah for archeology, but the interpretation was rather more complicated.
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect.
The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.
And, not surprisingly, they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand, calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon.
Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great, generous things of setting the people free.
And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk.
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this.
For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen.
It can only be Jehovah.
And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people.
It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event, two different religious takeovers of a political fact.
God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions.
The question is, which god was it?
And the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion.
And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah, and yet, Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk.
And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this, because he says, this is God speaking, of course, "I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me."
I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.
And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.
Because interestingly, of course, Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts.
That's 1879.
40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world.
This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return.
And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.
And across Eastern Europe, Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan.
You all know what happened.
The state of Israel is setup, and 50 years later, in the late 60s, it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.
And another story of the cylinder begins.
The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide, has to be kept safe from communism, and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran, the Shah.
And so the Shah invents an Iranian history, or a return to Iranian history, that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder.
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis, he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran, and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty.
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.
10 years later, another story: Iranian Revolution, 1979.
Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus; we're not interested in that history, we're interested in Islamic Iran -- until Iraq, the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region, attacks.
Then another Iran-Iraq war.
And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past, their great past when they fought Iraq and won.
It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians -- Muslims and non-Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran, people who are devout, not devout.
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan.
It's the only object they want.
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.
And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time.
It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions, Mrs. Ardakani.
It was a huge event.
This is the other side of that same picture.
It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months.
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West.
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths.
And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.
To see this object in Tehran, thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it.
It became a great emblem, a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad.
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?
This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return.
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran.
It was a narrative presented by the president himself.
And for me, to take this object to Iran, to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is, what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today.
It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration.
It stands with the American constitution.
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta.
It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region.
A replica of this is at the United Nations.
In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place.
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures.
It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories.
And what story of the Middle East, what story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said, what is expressed in this cylinder?
The right of peoples to live together in the same state, worshiping differently, freely -- a Middle East, a world, in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate.
In the world of the Middle East at the moment, the debates are, as you know, shrill.
But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing, the Cyrus cylinder.
Thank you.
How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?
Any of you get really freaked out by that?
You might want to leave now.
So, this is a vending machine for crows.
And over the past few days, many of you have been asking me, "How did you come to this?
How did you get started doing this?"
And it started, as with many great ideas, or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway, at a cocktail party.
About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine, and we're sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess.
And he was telling me that really, we ought to try and eradicate these things.
We gotta kill them because they're making a mess.
I said that was stupid, you know, maybe we should just train them to do something useful.
And he said that was impossible.
And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it's impossible.
So, I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.
And after 10 years of this, my wife eventually said, "Look, you know, you gotta do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine."
So I did.
But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving.
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species, which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies, species like rats and cockroaches and crows.
They'd become extremely adept at living with us.
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.
And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.
So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows, have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.
So, I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial.
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.
And so I built the vending machine.
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows.
It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings -- they're actually really thriving.
They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America.
And in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings.
So we may not think about them, but they're always around.
And not surprisingly, given the human population growth, more than half of the human population is living in cities now.
And out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities.
We're seeing a population boom with crows.
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.
So that's no great surprise.
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.
And I'll give you an example of that.
So this is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow.
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.
Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.
But the researchers had a problem.
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.
And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.
You see, it wasn't working very well.
So she adapted.
Now this is completely unprompted. She had never seen this done before.
No one taught her to bend this into a hook, had shown her how it could happen.
But she did it all on her own.
So keep in mind that she's never seen this done.
Right.
Yeah. All right.
That's the part where the researchers freak out.
So, it turns out we've been finding more and more that crows are really, really intelligent.
Their brains are proportionate, in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have.
For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice.
And when the fishermen move off, the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.
On an entirely different tack, at University of Washington, they, a few years ago, were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.
Some students went out and netted some crows, brought them in, and were -- weighed them, and measured them and whatnot, and then let them back out again.
And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week, these crows, whenever these particular students walked around campus, these crows would caw at them, and run around and make their life kind of miserable.
They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week.
And the next month. And after summer break.
Until they finally graduated and left campus, and -- glad to get away, I'm sure -- came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.
So -- the moral being, don't piss off crows.
So now, students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask.
It's fairly interesting.
So we know that these crows are really smart, but the more I dug into this, the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.
Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments.
In this Japanese city, they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can't manage: drop it among the traffic.
The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.
Joshua Klein: Yeah, yeah. Pretty interesting.
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts.
In fact, that's old hat for crows.
This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo.
And since that time, all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.
And now, every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk, waiting to collect its lunch.
So, they're learning from each other. And research bears this out.
Parents seem to be teaching their young.
They've learned from their peers. They've learned from their enemies.
If I have a little extra time, I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely.
The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation.
And as we heard yesterday, that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble, and we're starting to see it with them.
They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment, which is really useful if you live in a city.
So we know that there's lots of crows.
We found out they're really smart, and we found out that they can teach each other.
And when all this became clear to me, I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.
So that's what we did.
This is a vending machine for crows.
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.
It's pretty simple.
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field, or someplace where there's lots of crows, and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.
And crows eventually come by, and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there.
And eventually, they eat up all the peanuts.
And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray, and they hop up and help themselves.
And then they leave, and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is really dandy, if you're a crow.
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.
So, when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.
Now, they're used to the sound of the machine, and they keep coming back, and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there.
And when they get really happy about this, we go ahead and stymie them.
And we move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.
Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing, this really pisses them off.
So, they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something -- they sweep things out of the way with their beak.
And they do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot, and when that happens, they get a peanut.
And so this goes on for some time.
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put the coin in the slot, and then they get their peanut.
And when they're really good and comfortable with that, we move to the final stage, in which they show up and nothing happens.
And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.
Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored, and then they go off and play in traffic.
Crows, on the other hand, show up, and they try and figure it out.
They know that this machine's been messing with them, through three different stages of behavior.
They figure it's gotta have more to it.
So, they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot.
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that, "Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage, lying around on the ground," hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot.
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts, until his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.
So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year, but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.
I think that crows can be trained to do other things.
For example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics?
Or maybe do search and rescue?
The main thing, the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.
We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them, but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.
Thanks very much.
What we're really here to talk about is the "how."
Okay, so how exactly do we create this world-shattering, if you will, innovation?
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.
We'll go back a little more than a year.
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?
It was February 3rd, 2008.
Anyone remember what happened, February 3rd, 2008?
Super Bowl.
I heard it over here.
It was the date of the Super Bowl.
And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties, is that it seemed to us that across the United States, if you will, tribal councils had convened.
And they had discussed things of great national importance.
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"
and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.
And if you go back in time to February 3rd, it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.
But when we talked to people, it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States.
Now what is a tribe?
A tribe is a group of about 20 -- so kind of more than a team -- 20 to about 150 people.
And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.
But not just work.
It's within these tribes that societies get built, that important things happen.
And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives from various tribal councils that met, also known as Super Bowl parties, we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.
February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.
We said, "The tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama."
Now, the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.
All of you are members of tribes.
In walking around at the break, many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.
And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do, which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe, and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe, and make introductions.
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.
So here is the bottom line.
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.
And so people form tribes.
They always have. They always will.
Just as fish swim and birds fly, people form tribes.
It's just what we do.
But here's the rub.
Not all tribes are the same, and what makes the difference is the culture.
Now here is the net out of this.
You're all a member of tribes.
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward, along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.
You don't want this.
Okay?
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.
Stage One produces people who do horrible things.
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.
Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes, and then pool together with people who think like they do.
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons.
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.
And I want to make the point that as members of society, we need to.
It's not enough to simply write people off.
But let's move on to Stage Two.
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."
So, this other book that Steve mentioned, that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance," my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I, argue that as people see the world, so they behave.
Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks, then their behavior will follow automatically from that.
It will be despairing hostility.
They'll do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means undermining other people.
Now, my birthday is coming up shortly, and my driver's license expires.
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe, which looks like this.
Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?
No. But in the one near me, where I have to go in just a few days, what I will say when I'm standing in line is, "How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"
Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?
Actually, no, I'm not.
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.
So in a Stage Two culture -- and we find these in all sorts of different places -- you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.
You find them in all places in society.
I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class.
But here is the point. If you believe and you say to people in your tribe, in effect, "My life sucks.
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck.
So it does."
If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.
What kind of innovation would get done?
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?
In fact it would be basically nil.
Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us.
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.
And we park. And we stay.
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."
I'm great and you're not.
Now imagine having a whole room of people saying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."
Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that."
A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.
I know this sounds like a joke.
Three doctors walk into a bar.
But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.
And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine?"
And the other said, "No.
That's great.
Congratulations!"
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said, "Well while you were, you know, doing your research," -- notice the condescending tone -- "While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."
And the third one got the same wry smile and said, "Well, while you were off doing your research, and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery, that eventually we'll train monkeys to do, or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all, I was off running the future of the residency program, which is really the future of medicine."
And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.
And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.
Now, we find these in places where really smart, successful people show up.
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four.
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.
And my question on the other side is just going to be, "What do you think they value?"
It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.
This is their lobby.
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.
Notice people are applauding for us.
They don't know who we are and they don't care.
And if they did they probably wouldn't applaud.
But you'll notice the level of excitement.
Notice, again, how they decorate their office.
Now, what's important to people at Zappos, these may not be the things that are important to you.
But they value things like fun.
And they value creativity.
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.
So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence, then something very important happens.
The group gels. And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger, into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.
But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.
There is, in fact, another stage.
Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great," this may seem a little incongruous.
This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.
Now think about that. South Africa, terrible atrocities had happened in the society.
And people came together focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.
There was no road map.
No one had ever done anything like this before.
And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance was people's values and their noble cause, what this group accomplished was historic.
And people, at the time, feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone, descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end.
In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.
So, people hear this and they conclude the following, as did we in doing the study.
Okay, got it.
I don't want to talk Stage One.
That's like, you know, "Life sucks."
Who wants to talk that way?
I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.
I really don't want to just say "I'm great," because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."
Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this.
The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it, the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights.
I mean, that's Stage Five, right?
Life is great, oriented only by our values, no other guidance.
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.
"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant, also known as King George.
We're great!
Who is not great?
England!"
Sorry.
Well, what about other great leaders?
What about Gandhi?
What about Martin Luther King?
I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.
In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.
He didn't say "We have a dream."
He said, "I have a dream."
Why did he do that?
Because most people are not at Stage Five.
Two percent are at Stage One.
About 25 percent are at Stage Two, saying, in effect, "My life sucks."
48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes, say, "I'm great and you're not."
And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.
Only about 22 percent of tribes are at Stage Four, oriented by our values, saying "We're great.
And our values are beginning to unite us."
Only two percent, only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five.
And those are the ones that change the world.
So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society.
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.
So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels, to go to where they are.
And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level.
I'd like to show you some examples of this.
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan, former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.
And you know what changed his life?
It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.
Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.
He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks, despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" -- to walking into a Boys and Girls Club, folding his arms, sitting down in a chair, and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.
I don't know anybody.
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck.
But I don't. So it does.
So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."
In fact, that's progress.
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then, over time, getting them connected.
So, what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four?
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.
TED represents a set of values, and as we unite around these values, something really interesting begins to emerge.
If you want this experience to live on as something historic, then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking.
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them.
That's called a triadic relationship.
See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.
They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them, not just to myself, so that my following is greater, but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves.
And ultimately that adds to their values.
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four, which is great, to Stage Five?
The story that I like to end with is this.
It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization.
You know they do polls, right?
So it's Stage Four. We're great.
Who is not great?
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll.
Okay, we understand that.
So, they were bored.
They wanted to change the world.
So here is the question someone asked.
"How could we, instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks, or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that, what does the entire world think?"
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics, who reported being bored.
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population of Sub-Saharan Africa?
How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology, and speak languages we don't speak, and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages.
Because in order to achieve on this great mission, we have to be able to do it.
Incidentally, they did pull it off.
And they released the first-ever world poll.
So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.
First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.
You're in tribes here.
Hopefully you're extending the reach of the tribes that you have.
But the question on the table is this: What kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making?
You're hearing one presentation after another, often representing a group of people, a tribe, about how they have changed the world.
If you do what we've talked about, you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.
And you don't leave them where they are.
You nudge them forward.
You remember to talk all five culture stages.
Because we've got people in all five, around us.
And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this: Will your tribes change the world?
Thank you very much.
The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden.
If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest, we see that Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.
We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.
There are very few doctors and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics.
So what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications.
And this has already saved millions of lives, and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.
But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease, because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The problem is that, what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem.
And the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda.
This was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic, before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV/AIDS.
So this became one of the driving passions of my life, to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems.
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.
Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room, and people actually used to work inside the computers.
But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone.
So, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips.
I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school, and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices.
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.
A close look at how the technology works: These are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system.
So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system.
So, with one microfluidic chip, which is the size of an iPhone, you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time.
For each patient, we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient.
And this is only done in four hours, 50 times faster than the current state of the art, at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options.
So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place.
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality.
Thank you very much.
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a real bugger.
They're really difficult for plants to produce.
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
Why would they go to that bother?
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.
Evolution works that way.
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.
There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."
And sure enough, there's the insect.
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar.
Do you want to come and get it?"
Now this is a plant.
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.
And this is the mimic.
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar.
It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.
This one's clever.
It's called obsidian.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.
Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.
So flies love this.
They fly in and they pollinate.
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.
It's really horrible.
And blowflies just can't help themselves.
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.
They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.
Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.
So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.
This thing does something else which is unusual.
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.
"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
And they get inside, and they get it all on.
And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.
And what a wonderful thing it is.
Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
So there's something that goes on off the end there.
"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.
Well yes we can.
So what is an insect seeing?
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.
These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.
And this is what it looks like with visible light.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Most bees don't perceive red.
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.
And I love the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.
That's the main use of that filter.
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
The theme of my talk today is, "Be an artist, right now."
Most people, when this subject is brought up, get tense and resist it: "Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.
I have to go to school, get a job, send my kids to lessons ... " You think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."
There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.
Don't they just pop into your head?
There are so many reasons why we can't be, indeed, we're not sure why we should be.
We don't know why we should be artists, but we have many reasons why we can't be.
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.
And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.
Well you might have, but I don't think so.
This is the theme of my talk today.
We are all born artists.
If you have kids, you know what I mean.
Almost everything kids do is art.
They draw with crayons on the wall.
They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV, but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.
Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear, and because they practice such art all day long, people honestly get a little tired around kids.
Kids will sometimes perform monodramas -- playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.
And some kids, when they get a bit older, start to lie.
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.
They're shocked.
"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"
She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"
But you shouldn't worry.
The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.
They are talking about things they didn't see.
It's amazing.
It's a wonderful moment.
Parents should celebrate.
"Hurray!
My boy finally started to lie!"
All right! It calls for celebration.
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what?
I met an alien on my way home."
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really?
An alien, huh?
What did it look like?
Did it say anything?
Where did you meet it?"
"Um, in front of the supermarket."
When you have a conversation like this, the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.
Soon, a story develops.
Of course this is an infantile story, but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does.
In essence, they are not different.
Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels, "Flaubert did not write a novel.
He merely connected one sentence after another.
The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."
That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence, then, without violating the scope of the first one, writing the next sentence.
And you continue to make connections.
Take a look at this sentence: Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it, Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.
Kafka did not show his work to his father.
He was not on good terms with his father.
On his own, he wrote these sentences.
Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought.
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence, which is not much different from what a kid does.
A kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller.
Kids do art.
They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand, making mountains and seas -- well, not seas, but different things -- people and dogs, etc.
But parents tell them, "It will all be washed away by the waves."
In other words, it's useless.
There's no need.
But kids don't mind.
They have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand.
Kids don't do it because someone told them to.
They aren't told by their boss or anyone, they just do it.
When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment, many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend, or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.
Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.
They talk about these kinds of experiences.
You must have had such a moment.
In that moment, art makes you happy because it's not work.
Work doesn't make you happy, does it?
Mostly it's tough.
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.
It's a bit mischievous, actually.
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."
Right?
Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?
Playing doesn't tire us.
We can play all night long.
If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.
Why?
Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.
But kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.
They don't draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family.
Of course, there were kids who had to.
You know this gentleman, right?
He had to tour around Europe to support his family -- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart -- but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.
Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.
Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons, but they aren't fun anymore.
You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?
If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall, you'll surely get in trouble with your mom.
Besides, if you continue to act like an artist as you get older, you'll increasingly feel pressure -- people will question your actions and ask you to act properly.
Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.
I was trying my best, and my teacher came around and asked me, "What are you doing?"
"I'm drawing diligently," I said.
"Why are you using only black?"
Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.
And I explained, "It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."
Then my teacher said, "Really?
Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."
Or so I wished.
"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response.
"You'll get it!"
You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc., but I was coloring everything in black, so he dragged me out of the group.
There were a lot of girls there as well, so I was utterly mortified.
None of my explanations or excuses were heard, and I really got it big time.
If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before, "Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing, but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.
But such a teacher is seldom found.
Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries -- I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.
Look what I found.
Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?
Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.
No crows are brought up.
Most of the works have no title, Untitled.
Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation -- essentially the same as I did.
Of course, my work was very amateur, but let's turn to more famous examples.
This is Picasso's.
He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?
Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".
That was Duchamp.
So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories -- that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.
Picasso even made the statement, "I draw not what I see but what I think."
Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.
Unfortunately, the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.
They get locked in.
That's our tragedy.
So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?
Our artistic desire doesn't go away.
We want to express, to reveal ourselves, but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.
In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing "She's Gone" or "Hotel California," miming the guitar riffs.
Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.
Some people turn into rockers like this.
Or some people dance in clubs.
People who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the Internet all night long.
That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.
Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
They go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."
The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else, but the dad alone builds castles.
This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.
But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
You know the song "I would love to be on TV"?
Why would we love it?
TV is full of people who do what we wished to do, but never got to.
They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.
So we start to envy them.
We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
"He just can't act." "You call that singing?
She can't hit the notes."
We easily say these sorts of things.
We get jealous, not because we're evil, but because we have little artists pent up inside us.
That's what I think.
What should we do then?
Yes, that's right.
Right now, we need to start our own art.
Right this minute, we can turn off TV, log off the Internet, get up and start to do something.
Where I teach students in drama school, there's a course called Dramatics.
In this course, all students must put on a play.
However, acting majors are not supposed to act.
They can write the play, for example, and the writers may work on stage art.
Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.
Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it, but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.
In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.
I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays.
I have another experience: In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.
I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.
Some major in art or music and think they can't write.
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
It can be a simple theme: Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
There's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!
I walk around and encourage them, "Come on, come on!"
They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.
They only get to think for the first five minutes.
The reason I make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind, the artistic devil creeps in.
This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write: "People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!
What kind of sentence is this?
Look at your handwriting!"
It will say a lot of things.
You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.
The really good writing I've seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline, but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil.
The students go into a kind of trance.
After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.
So I can say this: It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist, but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.
Why we cannot be something is not important.
Most artists became artists because of the one reason.
When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art, enemies appear on the outside.
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents.
Sometimes they look like our spouses, but they are not your parents or spouses.
They are devils. Devils.
They came to Earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.
And they have a magic question.
When we say, "I think I'll try acting.
There's a drama school in the community center," or "I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah?
A play?
What for?"
The magic question is, "What for?"
But art is not for anything.
Art is the ultimate goal.
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
So in response to such a pragmatic question, we need to be bold.
"Well, just for the fun of it.
Sorry for having fun without you," is what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway."
The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities, at least one of which is an artist.
Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat, and in front of me I saw something related to a play.
So I asked the driver, "What is this?"
He said it was his profile. "Then what are you?"
I asked.
"An actor," he said.
He was a cabby and an actor. I asked, "What roles do you usually play?"
He proudly said he played King Lear.
King Lear.
"Who is it that can tell me who I am?"
-- a great line from King Lear.
That's the world I dream of.
Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.
Or a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter, secretly or publicly performing their own arts.
In 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.
The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport and a reporter asked her a typical question: "What do you have to do to become a great dancer?
Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"
Now, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.
In 1990, she was asked this question.
And here's what she answered: "Just do it."
Wow. I was touched.
Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it.
So what should we do now?
Let's be artists, right now. Right away. How?
Just do it!
Thank you.
An event seen from one point of view gives one impression.
Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.
But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on.
Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?
And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about the power of, and importance of, independent media than I could say in an hour.
So I thought that it will be good to start with it.
And also start with a little bit of statistics.
According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press.
Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries.
The information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information, or colors that information, does something with it.
So they're deprived of understanding their reality.
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.
You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags, but they can also lose press freedom, as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.
But that's totally another and separate topic.
So I can go back to my story.
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991.
At that time I was running B92, the only independent, for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment, where government really wants to make your life miserable.
And there are different ways.
Yeah, it was the usual cocktail: a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice, a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control, so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.
But what they really do, which is very powerful, and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing if they don't like independent media companies -- you know, they threaten your advertisers.
Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually, you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come -- no matter how much does it make sense for them -- do not want to come and advertise.
And you have a problem making ends meet.
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem, which was, you know, survival below one side, but what was really painful for me was, remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall, in a slow-motion downfall.
And we all had all of that on tapes.
We had the ability to understand what was going on.
We were actually recording history.
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later; because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history.
So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.
It was still 1991.
He was running a media systems organization which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.
And what did I know at that time about media systems?
I would think media systems were organizations, which means they should help you.
So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans: the small one and the big one.
The small one was, I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes, so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.
Because I thought, I still maintain, that serious and independent media companies are great business.
And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.
It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country.
And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.
To make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office, great suit and tie.
I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be.
Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.
Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation, the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke -- is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson?
That was really the only question he had.
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies.
It's so obvious, straight in your face, and somebody must have thought of it.
Somebody must have started something like that.
And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.
You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time; you could not just Google in '91.
So I thought that that's actually my problem.
Now we go from here, fast forward to 1995.
I have -- I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros, trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank.
And basically what I was saying is very simple.
You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.
Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.
What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.
It's business anywhere.
Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.
And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.
So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.
At the end of the meeting he says, look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back; but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.
See that it will not work.
He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.
I knew two things after that meeting.
First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.
But it's one thing to have a concept; it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.
So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.
Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here; I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.
You know, you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money.
You give them more money; they repay you that over a time.
You collect interest and do nothing in between.
So I thought, why don't we get into that business?
So here we are having our first client, brilliant.
First independent newspaper in Slovakia.
The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava.
So here's the daily newspaper that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.
It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
That means that they have no sports; they have no latest news; circulation goes down.
It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper.
They come to us with a request for a loan.
They want to -- the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press.
And we said, that's fine; let's meet; you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.
We start the meeting.
I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format, so it's much bigger.
A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.
But however you put it, you know, the numbers do not make any sense.
And that's the best they could do.
We were the best that they could do.
So that is how we understood what our method is.
It's not a bank.
We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them -- by establishing management systems, by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business on one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.
Just quickly on the results.
Over these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing, average interest rate five percent to six percent.
Lately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world.
And here is the most stunning number.
Return rate -- the one that Soros was so worried about -- 97 percent.
97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.
What do we typically finance?
We finance anything that a media company would need, from printing presses to transmitters.
What is most important is we do it either in form of loans, equities, lease -- whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.
But what is most important here is, who do we finance?
We believe that in the last 10 years companies that we've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world.
That is a "Who is Who" list.
And I could spend hours talking about them, because they're all kind of heroes.
And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one, and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with.
You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe, and moved to Russia.
Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.
I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.
In the south of Russia there's a guy called Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running an independent newspaper there.
The city was closed until early '90s because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.
Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there.
After two years working with us, he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place.
Governor comes to him one day, actually invites him to come to his office.
He goes and sees the governor.
The governor says, Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job, and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.
And I want to offer you a deal.
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months, because I have elections -- there are elections coming up in nine months.
I will not run, but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me.
So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.
I have no interest in being in media business.
How much would that cost?
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."
The governor says, "We will close you."
Boris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."
Six months later the newspaper was closed.
Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one, to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.
So what the governor got was an empty shell.
But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media, and if you are a banker for independent media.
So it sounds like a great story.
We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.
But there is a second angle to that.
The second angle, like in this clip.
If you take the camera above, you start thinking about these numbers again.
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.
That is not too much, is it?
It's actually just a drop in the sea.
Because when you think about the importance, some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last session we had about Africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.
All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night -- government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption, giving voice to unheard, to poor -- it's why independent media is in business.
And it's why it was invented.
So from that perspective, what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.
Now ours is just one story.
I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work.
Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
And it's called fundraising.
Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations.
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations, doing very important work.
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.
Now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room.
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform, to totally rethink fundraising.
You know, instead of people running in this dark, trying to find their own match, who will be willing, who has the same goals.
Instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented.
And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds, press freedom bonds.
If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit, why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit?
We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them, probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.
I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.
But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them, find enough investors that this can be considered a success, there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring.
And those can be environmental bonds.
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds.
And before you know it, any social cause can be actually financed in this way.
Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.
But let's take the idea further.
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's, you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.
But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.
You can bring it to Asia.
You can, once you have all of those different points, you can make it easy for investors.
Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click.
Once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix.
What do investors get?
On one side financial, on the other side social.
So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency, Morningstar type.
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.
Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.
Now take it to the last step.
Once you have all of that put together, there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a marketplace for all of that, where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.
And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms, no blind people running around to find each other.
Thank you.
So I really consider myself a storyteller.
But I don't really tell stories in the usual way, in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.
Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories, people all around the world.
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.
I think people are very similar, but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.
You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps, and I think we all see a lot of gaps.
And we define ourselves by our gaps.
There's language gaps, there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps, there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps, there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps, there's also religious gaps.
You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something, some smaller community.
But I think that actually, despite our gaps, we really have a lot in common.
And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves.
I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.
But the thing about self-expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen.
This, also, is nothing new.
Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art, writing poems, singing songs, scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper, gossiping with friends.
This is nothing new.
What's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities, these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.
And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints, footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.
And so what I do is, I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints, and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them -- what they feel, what they think, what's different in the world today than usual, these sorts of questions.
One project that explores these ideas, which was made about a year ago, is a piece called We Feel Fine.
This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world's newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."
And when it finds one of those phrases, it grabs the sentence up to the period, and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.
Then, knowing the geographical location and the time, we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence.
All of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.
It's been running for about a year and a half.
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.
And I'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized.
So this is We Feel Fine.
What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles, each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours.
The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside -- so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.
And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.
The diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside, so that the large dots contain large sentences, and the small dots contain small sentences.
Any dot can be clicked and expanded.
And we see here, "I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions.
And all of these are stated by people: "I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much, but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond, it's nice to feel bigger again."
The dots exhibit human qualities.
They kind of have their own physics, and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.
And then they also exhibit curiosity.
You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.
You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words.
Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine.
We're currently seeing Madness.
There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.
And I'll walk you through a few of those now.
Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order, they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.
"I feel a bit better now."
"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do."
"I feel gypped out of something awesome here."
"I feel so free; I feel so good."
"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."
And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected. And in that way, you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy.
The next movement is called Montage.
Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid.
This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours, if you will.
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.
We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun if it's not the both of us."
That was from someone in Michigan.
We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."
These are automatically constructed using the found objects: "I think I feel a little full."
The next movement is called mobs.
Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.
We see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now, followed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.
We can also get a gender breakdown.
And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.
We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram of the world's emotional distribution by age.
We see people in their twenties are the most prolific, followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties, and it dies out very quickly from there.
In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent, so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they're part of the sun.
The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.
The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm, and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.
Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.
We see that the world is feeling "used" at 3.3 times the normal level right now.
They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.
Other views are also available.
Here are gender, age, weather, location.
The final movement is called Mounds.
It's a bit different from the others.
Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle.
And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.
We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."
And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll, and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
You can see the little pink cursor moving along, representing our position.
Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."
There's also a search capability, if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.
For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted" in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.
But I'll spare you that.
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected: "I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me."
"I feel very lonely."
"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful."
"I feel invisible to you."
"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."
"I feel in love with Carolyn."
"I feel so naughty."
"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."
"I love how I feel today."
So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call "passive observation."
What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives.
It scans the world's blogs and looks at what people are writing, and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.
And because of that, you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses that are often very moving.
And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work because people don't know they're being interviewed.
They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.
Another technique is directly questioning people.
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project, the Yahoo! Time Capsule, which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.
It was divided into ten very simple themes -- love, anger, sadness and so on -- each of which contained a single, very open-ended question put to the world: What do you love?
What makes you angry?
What makes you sad?
What do you believe in?
And so on.
The time capsule was available for one month online, translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
It's a spinning globe, the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule.
The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.
You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.
This is in response to, What's beautiful?
"Miss World."
There are two modes to the time capsule.
There's One World, which presents the spinning globe, and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one.
So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event, which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights, the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls, which stand about 200 feet tall.
It was really incredible.
And we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there.
This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier -- the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.
But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more, and saw these images go across the rocks, I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again.
You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss, the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.
And it was really moving.
And this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away, where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.
And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.
And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky, and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories.
You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up, I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.
And as an adult, I've been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.
You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.
Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.
Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.
I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.
And it caused me to wonder about our world today.
And it caused me to wonder specifically, if we could make new constellations today, what would those look like?
What would those be?
If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?
What are the great stories of today?
And those are the questions that inspired my new project, which is debuting here today at TED.
Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.
It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.
And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.
So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.
So, Universe will open here.
And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field, and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background, kind of morphing with color.
The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom, and we'll put it down here to red.
So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.
Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.
Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was stated by somebody, an image, a news story, a person, a company. You know, some kind of heroic personality.
And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.
We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.
And we see here a photograph with a head.
You can start to see words emerging here.
And those are the constellations of today.
And I can turn them all on, and you can see them moving across the sky now.
This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.
The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world.
It's using the API of a really great company that I work with in New York, actually, called Daylife.
And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.
So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford, Iraq, Bush.
And we can actually isolate just the words -- I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list.
And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently.
President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.
We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe, and everything else will enter its orbit.
So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.
And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it.
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.
We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe.
Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.
We can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.
In Universe, there's kind of no end.
It just goes infinitely, and you can just kind of click on stuff.
This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.
So, if we want to, let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.
And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton.
We can have his constellations emerge here.
We can pull out his secrets, and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates, Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.
We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.
Any of those can be opened up.
So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.
You can see that this is an important story; there are a lot of things in its orbit.
If we open this up, we get different perspectives on this story.
You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source.
This one's from Al Jazeera.
We can also see the superstars. These would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of Bill Clinton.
So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary, Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby -- these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.
We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so.
We can see he's been focused in America because he's been campaigning, probably, but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.
And then we can also see a timeline.
So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday, but he was back to work on Sunday morning, and actually been tapering off since then this week.
And it's not limited to just people or dates, but we can actually put in concepts also.
So if I put in climate change for all of 2006, we'll see what that universe looks like.
Here we have our star field.
So we see again, climate change is large: Nairobi, global conference, environmental.
And there are also quotes that you can see, if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.
You know, this is really an infinite thing.
The superstars of climate change in 2006: United States, Britain, China.
You know, these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.
So this is a piece that demands exploration.
This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be.
You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe -- it supports both the notion of a global mythology, which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007, and also a personal mythology.
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world, and then see what the constellations of those might look like.
So it's been a pleasure.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.
Here is the old story -- we've already heard a little bit about it: biology is war in which only the fiercest survive; businesses and nations succeed only by defeating, destroying and dominating competition; politics is about your side winning at all costs.
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.
It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines, in which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role.
And the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room.
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs," and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.
In fact, if you look back, human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.
Humans have lived for much, much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups.
Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food.
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.
And we don't know exactly how they did this, although they must have solved some collective action problems; it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups.
And again, we have no way of knowing, but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.
So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms.
Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families?
And if so, how did they make arrangements?
Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved.
Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations, the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.
And it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks; marks on clay in that time.
Not too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.
And this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years, for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empires.
And then another communication technology enabled new media: the printing press came along, and within decades, millions of people became literate.
And from literate populations, new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge, religion and politics.
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation, constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
Not created by the printing press, but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.
And again, new forms of wealth emerged.
Now, commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads.
But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old, enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies, such as the joint-stock ownership company, shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.
Now of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet, and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press, a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.
Evolution is speeding up.
More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops, and very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of the human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today.
Now, when I started looking into collective action, the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."
And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them: the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.
Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly, he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma, so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.
If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later.
The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war: two players who couldn't trust each other.
Let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.
Person with the goods, person with the money, because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.
Neither one wants to be the first one or they're going to get the sucker's payoff, but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all?
He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered, much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
Here's how the game is played: there are two players; they've never played the game before, they will not play the game again, they don't know each other, and they are, in fact, in separate rooms.
First player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10, whatever that player wants to propose.
The second player either accepts the split -- both players are paid and the game is over -- or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over.
Now, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.
Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students, a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.
And although they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played the game before, proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.
Now, the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered, to their surprise, that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures -- each had radically different ideas of what is fair.
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness, that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions, whether we know that or not.
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.
He had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it.
Now, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in 1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask, which is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?
So she went out and looked at what data she could find.
She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds, forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case, humans destroyed the commons that they depended on.
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma; in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
They escape by creating institutions for collective action.
And she discovered, I think most interestingly, that among those institutions that worked, there were a number of common design principles, and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work.
I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines.
In biology, the notions of symbiosis, group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned.
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.
In fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.
And most recently, neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain.
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together.
Now, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms.
Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old.
Capitalism is fairly recent; socialism emerged as a reaction to that.
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source, pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.
I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth, we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones.
Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun -- some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace, treats them as a network and trains them to produce better, even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.
Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism; they're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.
Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.
Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.
They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.
eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.
Instead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves," it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.
We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world, including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now: it's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it, illiterates can be trained to use it.
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader, making the system more efficient the more it is used.
Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the Internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that's Folding@home at Stanford -- to crack codes, to search for life in outer space.
I don't think we know enough yet.
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are, but I think we can begin to think about them.
And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them, but think about self-interest.
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.
In the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world, citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.
Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
I believe that the payoff would be very big.
I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines.
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people -- and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things -- but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago, people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.
Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease, suffering was alleviated.
What forms of suffering could be alleviated, what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation?
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen; it's going to require effort.
Good afternoon.
I am proud to be here at TEDxKrakow.
I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and is actually changing the world, and whose name is people power.
I'll start with the anecdote, or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers, a Monty Python type of sketch.
Here it is.
It is December 15, 2010.
Somebody gives you a bet.
You will look at a crystal ball and you will see the future. The future will be accurate.
But you need to share it with the world.
Okay?
Curiosity killed the cat.
You take the bet.
You look at the crystal ball.
One hour later, you are sitting in a building on the national TV in a talkshow, and you tell the story.
"Before the end of 2011, Ben Ali and Mubarak and Gaddafi will be down and prosecuted.
Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria would be either challenged or already on their knees.
Osama bin Laden will be dead, and Ratko Mladic will be in the Hague."
Now, the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face, and then on the top of it you add, "And thousands of the young people from Athens, Madrid and New York will demonstrate for social justice, claiming that they are inspired with Arabs."
Next thing you know, two guys in white appear.
They give you the strange t-shirt, take you to the nearest mental institution.
So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be the very bad year for bad guys, and this phenomenon is called people power.
Well, people power has been there for a while.
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India.
It helped Martin Luther King win a historic racial struggle.
It helped local Lech Walesa to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland and beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.
So what's new in it?
What seems to be very new, which is the idea I would like to share with you today, that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle.
If this is true, we can help these movements.
Well, first one, analytic skills.
I'll try where it all started in the Middle East, and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the Middle East.
It was looking like the frozen region, literally a refrigerator, and there are only two types of meals there: steak, which stands for a Mubarak, Ben Ali-type of military police dictatorship, or a potato, which stands for Tehran types of theocracies.
And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions of young, mainly secular people step out to do the change.
Guess what?
They didn't watch the demographics.
What is the average age of Egyptians?
24.
How long was Mubarak in power?
31.
So this system: just obsolete.
They expired, and young people of the Arab World have awakened one morning and understood that power lies in their hands.
The rest is the year in front of us. And guess what?
The same Generation Epsilon with their rules, with their tools, with their games and with their language, which sounds a little bit strange to me.
I am 38 now.
And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe?
It seems that Generation Epsilon is coming.
Now let me set another example.
I'm meeting different people throughout the world, and they are, you know, academics and professors and doctors, and they will always talk conditions.
They will say, "People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive."
They will say, "People power will work if the annual income of the country is between X and Z."
They will say, "People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure."
They will say, "People power will work only if there is no oil."
And, I mean, there is a set of conditions.
Well, the news here is that your skills [that you] bring in the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions, namely skills of unity, planning, and maintaining nonviolent discipline.
Let me give you the example.
I am coming from a country called Serbia.
It took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders, with their big egos, behind one single candidate against Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic.
Guess what?
That was the day of his defeat.
You look at the Egyptians, they fire on Tahrir Square, they get rid of their individual symbols.
They appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt.
I will give you a counter-example.
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko.
You will know the outcome.
So unity is a big thing, and this can be achieved.
Same with planning.
Somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution?
That thing doesn't exist in the world.
Whenever you see young people in front of the road trying to fraternize with the police or military, somebody was thinking about it before.
Now, at the end, nonviolent discipline, and this is probably the game-changer.
If you maintain nonviolent discipline, you will exclusively win.
You have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march, and one idiot or agent provocateur is throwing stones, guess what takes all the cameras? That one guy.
One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement.
Now let me move to another place.
It's selection of strategies and tactics.
There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow.
First, you start small.
Second, you pick the battles you can win.
It's only 200 of us in this room.
We won't call for the March of Millions.
But what if we organize spraying graffiti throughout the night all over Krakow city?
The city will know.
So we pick the tactics which accommodates to the event, especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion.
They're very useful in a violent oppression.
We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used.
It was on Tahrir Square, where the international community was constantly frightened that the Islamists will overtake the revolution.
Well, they've organized Christians protecting Muslims, who are there praying, Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims.
The world has just changed the picture, but somebody was thinking about this previously.
So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place, shouting and showing off in front of the security forces.
Now there is also another very important dynamic, and this is a dynamic normally analytics don't see.
This is dynamics between fear and apathy on one side and enthusiasm and humor on another side.
So it works like in a video game.
You have a fear high, you have status quo.
You have enthusiasm higher, you see fear starting to melt.
Day two, you see people running towards police instead of from the police.
In Egypt, you can tell that something is happening there.
And then it's about humor.
Humor is such a powerful game-changer, and of course it was very big in Poland.
And you know, we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit.
We put the big petrol barrel with a portrait picture of Mr. President on it in the middle of the Main Street.
There was a hole on the top so you could literally come, put a coin in, get a baseball bat, and pow, hit his face.
Sounds loud.
And within the minutes, we were sitting in a nearby cafe having coffee, and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing.
Well, that's just the beginning of the show.
The real show starts when the police appears.
What will they do?
Arrest us?
We are nowhere to be seen.
We are three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar.
Arrest the shoppers with kids?
Doesn't make sense.
Of course, you could bet they have done the most stupid thing: They arrested the barrel.
And now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policeman dragging them to the police car, that was the best day for the photographers from newspapers that they ever will have.
So, I mean, these are the things you can do, and you can always use the humor.
There is also one big thing about the humor: It really hurts, because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously.
When you start to mock them, it hurts.
Now, everybody is talking about His Majesty, the Internet, and it is also a very useful skill, but don't rush to label things like Facebook Revolution, Twitter Revolution.
Don't mix tools with the substance.
It is true that the Internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper.
They make it also a bit safer for the participants because they give the part of anonymity.
We are watching the great example of something else the Internet can do.
It can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence over nonviolent protesters.
This is a famous group, We are all Khaled Said, made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt and his friend.
This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police.
This is how he became the public, and this is what probably became the straw which broke the camel's back.
But here is also the bad news.
The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world, in the streets.
You will never change your society towards democracy or economics if you sit down and click.
There are risks to be taken and there are living people who are winning the struggle.
Well, million dollar question: What will happen in the Arab World?
And though young people from the Arab World were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators, shaking the region, kind of persuading clever kings from Jordan and Morocco doing substantial reforms, it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome, whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflict, whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline, faced with the brutal daily violence which kills thousands already, or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war.
Will these revolutions be whole like through the transitions to democracy or be overtaken by military or extremists of all kinds?
We cannot tell.
Same works for the Western sector, where you can see all of these excited young people protesting around the world, occupying this, occupying that.
Are they going to become the world wave?
Are they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform, or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate?
This is the difference between two towns.
Now, what [do] the statistics have?
My friend's book, Maria Stephan's book, talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle, and there are some shocking data.
If you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy, you will see that out of 67 different cases, in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power.
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon.
This is one more reason to look at the Generation Epsilon, enough for me to give them credit and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use the nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world.
Thank you.
Can I say how delighted I am to be away from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall?
This is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl, her back ruined by napalm, and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America to begin to end the Vietnam War.
This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the 1980s, 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued, and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.
This is Tiananmen Square.
A man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.
This next is the Sudanese girl, a few moments from death, a vulture hovering in the background, a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty.
This is Neda, the Iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran only a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so, of the YouTube generation.
And what do all these pictures and events have in common?
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see.
What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community.
What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others, however distantly.
What I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.
What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths, across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others, and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted, see injuries that need to be corrected, see problems that need to be rectified.
There is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister, going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.
Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said -- and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister -- "Isn't this man a communist?"
The reply was, "No, Mr President, he's an anti-communist."
And Ronald Reagan said, "I don't care what kind of communist he is!"
Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme, the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, "Well, what do you believe in?
Do you want to abolish the rich?"
He said, "No, I want to abolish the poor."
Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full.
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith, and people of no faith.
But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world.
We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society.
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.
They protested across Britain.
They won public opinion over a long period of time.
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people's hearts and minds?
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb, the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.
She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria, that in Britain she wanted to take action, but she had to go house to house, leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children, an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.
But what more could she have done if she'd had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately?
Now look at what's happened in the last 10 years.
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada -- a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime, eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text."
Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.
Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out, a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs told the world that there was a repression, meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi, who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world, had to be listened to.
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today: following what happened to Neda, people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging, changing their address to Tehran, Iran, and making it difficult for the security services.
Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of: the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally.
That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world.
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites; it's got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging, who are communicating with each other around the world.
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people, children, had the right to education.
100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid, discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation.
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so -- when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage.
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.
Amy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.
My husband too has spent a long time in prison."
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all.
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.
He said that there was a greater challenge ahead, the challenge of poverty, of climate change -- global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society.
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this.
Combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face, most of which are global in their nature.
Climate change cannot be solved in one country, but has got to be solved by the world working together.
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone; it needed the world to work together.
Take the problems of security and terrorism and, equally, the problem of human rights and development: they cannot be solved by Africa alone; they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together.
So the great project of our generation, it seems to me, is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together, a truly global society, built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future.
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem, where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that, when we want to create a global carbon market, but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem?
One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda.
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well, so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations.
Take the financial crisis.
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.
If people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland or the rest in Britain, and people's ordinary savings are affected by it, then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth, for jobs, as well as for financial stability, global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared, and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility, not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.
Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future, and yet, out of people's desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done.
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.
This is a country of six and a half million people, but it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses; it has 120 midwives.
You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources.
Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania, a girl called Miriam.
She was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS, her mother and then her father.
She was an AIDS orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for.
She herself was suffering from HIV; she was suffering from tuberculosis.
I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.
When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future, but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl's eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment, I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture, so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.
Take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world.
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy, in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent.
In the Rwanda Children's Museum, there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.
There is a photograph of a boy called David.
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life.
It said "David, age 10."
David: ambition to be a doctor.
Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?
Making people laugh.
How did he die?
Tortured to death.
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death: "Don't worry.
The United Nations are coming."
And we never did.
And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda, and we never did.
So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.
So my argument today is basically this.
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society.
The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work, but we should not lose the chance in this generation, in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America, with other people working with us around the world, to create global institutions for the environment, and for finance, and for security and for development, that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples, our desire to bind the world together, and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.
It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences, people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."
But it is said that in Ancient Greece when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences, people turned to each other and didn't say "Great speech."
They said, "Let's march."
We should be marching towards a global society.
Thank you.
And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination, our inscapes. We've lived with them all our lives.
But there are also hallucinations as well, and hallucinations are completely different.
They don't seem to be of our creation.
They don't seem to be under our control.
They seem to come from the outside, and to mimic perception.
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations, and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients.
A few months ago, I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work.
They told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s, was seeing things, and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers or, because she was an old lady, whether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's.
And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie, the old lady.
I went in to see her.
It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence, but she'd been very startled and very bewildered, because she'd been seeing things.
And she told me -- the nurses hadn't mentioned this -- that she was blind, that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.
But now, for the last few days, she'd been seeing things.
So I said, "What sort of things?"
And she said, "People in Eastern dress, in drapes, walking up and down stairs.
A man who turns towards me and smiles.
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.
Animals too.
I see a white building. It's snowing, a soft snow.
I see this horse with a harness, dragging the snow away.
Then, one night, the scene changes.
I see cats and dogs walking towards me.
They come to a certain point and then stop.
Then it changes again.
I see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs.
They wear bright colors, rose and blue, like Eastern dress."
Sometimes, she said, before the people come on, she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor, which seem to go up to the ceiling.
I said, "Is this like a dream?"
And she said, "No, it's not like a dream.
It's like a movie."
She said, "It's got color. It's got motion.
But it's completely silent, like a silent movie."
And she said that it's a rather boring movie.
She said, "All these people with Eastern dress, walking up and down, very repetitive, very limited."
And she has a sense of humor.
She knew it was a hallucination.
But she was frightened. She'd lived 95 years and she'd never had a hallucination before.
She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing, that they seemed to come on by themselves, or disappear.
She had no control over them.
She said she didn't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations.
And none of the people or the animals, well, they all seemed oblivious of her.
And she didn't know what was going on.
She was a bright old lady, perfectly sane. She had no medical problems.
She wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations.
This was originally described," I said, "right back in the 18th century, by a man called Charles Bonnet.
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.
There is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind.
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
And she was very relieved at this, that there was nothing seriously the matter, and also rather curious.
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"
She said, "Did he have them himself?"
And she said, "Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented.
I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
Well, so I did tell the nurses.
Now this, for me, is a common situation.
I work in old-age homes, largely.
I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired.
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations.
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations.
You don't have to be completely blind, only sufficiently impaired.
Now with the original description in the 18th century, Charles Bonnet did not have them.
His grandfather had these hallucinations.
His grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.
He'd had cataract surgery.
His vision was pretty poor.
And in 1759, he described to his grandson various things he was seeing.
The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair.
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles.
And he knew it was a hallucination.
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.
But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not, because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions.
So on one occasion, when his granddaughters were visiting them, he said, "And who are these handsome young men with you?"
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men."
And then the handsome young men disappeared.
It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.
They don't usually fade in and out.
They are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.
Charles Lullin, the grandfather, saw hundreds of different figures, different landscapes of all sorts.
On one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe, and realized it was himself.
That was the only figure he recognized.
On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris, he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.
But when he got back home, he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high, on his study table.
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia.
With him and with Rosalie, what seems to be going on -- and Rosalie said, "What's going on?"
-- and I said that as you lose vision, as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input, they become hyperactive and excitable, and they start to fire spontaneously.
And you start to see things.
The things you see can be very complicated indeed.
With another patient of mine, who, also had some vision, the vision she had could be disturbing.
On one occasion, she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.
And he turned around. And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts, who started walking towards her.
And then the six figures came together again, like a concertina.
Once, when she was driving, or rather, her husband was driving, the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.
She had very mobile hallucinations as well.
A lot of them had to do with a car.
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car.
He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned.
And then when they came to a stop, the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air, and then disappear.
And, above all, she would see cartoons.
Now, I don't watch Sesame Street, but she made a point of saying, "Why Kermit?"
She said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.
You know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants.
Why Kermit?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed, with very large teeth or very large eyes.
And these frightened her.
Well, what is going on with these people?
As a physician, I have to try and define what's going on, and to reassure people, especially to reassure them that they're not going insane.
Something like 10 percent, as I said, of visually impaired people get these.
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them, because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.
And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed.
In particular, the notion is that if you see things or hear things, you're going mad, but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different.
Psychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal, they address you. They accuse you.
They seduce you. They humiliate you.
They jeer at you.
You interact with them.
There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.
There is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you, or that's how people think about it.
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy, and sometimes, if one has this, one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past.
You're at a particular road junction.
You smell chestnuts roasting.
You hear the traffic. All the senses are involved.
And you're waiting for your girl.
And it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.
And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations, full of feeling, full of familiarity, located in space and time, coherent, dramatic.
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations, you have all sorts of levels, from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces.
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces, are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations.
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.
So, what is going on?
Fascinatingly, in the last few years, it's been possible to do functional brain imagery, to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating.
And in fact, to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating.
When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations, the primary visual cortex is activated.
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.
You don't form images with your primary visual cortex.
When images are formed, a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe.
And in particular, one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus.
And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus, they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces.
But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus, they may hallucinate faces, and this is exactly what you find in some of these people.
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented, and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations.
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons.
It's activated when one recognizes cartoons, when one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.
It's very interesting that that should be specific.
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes.
Around 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain, but particular cells.
"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells, which can be very, very specific.
So you may not only have "car" cells, you may have "Aston Martin" cells.
I saw an Aston Martin this morning.
I had to bring it in.
And now it's in there somewhere.
Now, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex, there are only visual images, or figments or fragments.
It's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion.
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome, you don't go to those higher levels.
You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images, or figments, or fragmentary figments, all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells.
Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception, or imagination, and one is not conscious of them.
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted.
And instead of getting normal perception, you're getting an anarchic, convulsive stimulation, or release, of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex.
So, suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car.
Suddenly this, and suddenly that.
The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this, but not terribly successfully.
When these were first described, it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.
But in fact people say, "I don't recognize the people.
I can't form any associations."
"Kermit means nothing to me."
You don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams.
Well, I've more or less said what I wanted.
I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common.
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice, for patients, for doctors, for the public.
Finally, I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable, for giving one some insight as to how the brain works.
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago -- he wondered how, thinking these hallucinations, how, as he put it, the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain.
Now, 250 years later, I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done.
Thanks very much.
That was superb. Thank you so much.
You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients.
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.
Well, yeah, a lot of them.
And actually I'm a little visually impaired myself.
I'm blind in one eye, and not terribly good in the other.
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.
But they stop there.
And they don't disturb you?
Because you understand what's doing it, it doesn't make you worried?
OS: Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus, which I ignore.
They occasionally interest me, and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.
I've gone and had an fMRI myself, to see how my visual cortex is taking over.
And when I see all these hexagons and complex things, which I also have, in visual migraine, I wonder whether everyone sees things like this, and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit.
That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk.
Thank you so much for sharing.
OS: Thank you. Thank you.
I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey -- extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually -- which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis.
As a child, I had two passions.
One was a passion for rodents.
I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels.
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.
I also had a passion for Africa.
Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity.
Africa was truly fascinating for me.
I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries.
I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode.
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines.
We're talking '95 now.
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true.
As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land.
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world.
We chose rats.
Why would you choose rats?
Because, aren't they vermin?
Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures.
And actually, our product -- what you see here.
There's a target somewhere here.
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right.
There, the animal finds a mine.
It scratches on the soil.
And the animal comes back for a food reward.
Very, very simple.
Very sustainable in this environment.
Here, the animal gets its food reward.
And that's how it works.
Very, very simple.
Now why would you use rats?
Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments.
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species.
They're extremely sensitive to smell.
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it.
Now how do we communicate with rats?
Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there.
A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat.
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets.
In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields.
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test.
This consists of 400 square meters.
There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets.
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way.
Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog.
This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows.
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.
They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid.
Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up.
But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down.
Question of scale.
If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger.
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology.
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines.
But let me bring you to a very different problem.
And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection.
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem.
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.
It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B.
And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.
You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives.
So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B.
is "tering," which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar.
Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients.
So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row.
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology.
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there.
So how does it work?
You have a cassette with 10 samples.
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.
Here it's already at the third sample.
This is a positive sample.
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.
And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative.
Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only.
A cage like this -- A cage like this -- provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples.
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.
But let's stick first to tuberculosis.
I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done.
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent.
Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent.
So this is really considerable.
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives.
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology.
And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds.
So, to standardize this.
Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people.
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on.
This is in a prototype stage.
We don't have a working system here yet.
To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people.
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available.
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human.
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work.
Thank you very much.
The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+.
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.
And I'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within, and to follow the TED commandments: that is, actually, something that creates a near-death experience, but near-death is good for creativity.
OK.
So, I also want to explain, because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.
And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, which includes a number of things that happened, actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new.
And that includes nature, and nurture, and what I refer to as nightmares.
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something, perhaps in our brains, some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect.
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.
And others, like my mother, would say that I get my material from past lives.
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic, that he might have had temporal lobe seizures, and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time I was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different.
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis: you know, who am I, why am I this particular person, why am I not black like everybody else?
And sometimes you're equipped with skills, but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
I used to draw.
I thought I would be an artist.
And I had a miniature poodle.
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words.
Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.
That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure.
But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14.
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father, six months later, had brain tumors.
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles, and that God's will would take care of that.
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.
Everything except randomness.
She did not believe in randomness.
There was a reason for everything.
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother, who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.
And so, I had this notion of death all around me, because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon, you begin to think very much about everything.
You become very creative, in a survival sense.
And this, then, led to my big questions.
And they're the same ones that I have today.
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300, you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen, in what order they happen. What are the influences?
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe, as the creator of that universe.
And you see, there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out -- years and years, oftentimes.
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on.
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association: quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand, but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor.
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters.
The meaning.
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it.
And this happens constantly in the writing.
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about.
And if you try too hard, then you will only write the about.
You won't discover anything.
And what you were supposed to find, what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way, is no longer there.
Now, I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe, like many of our scientists have.
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.
And they all operate at the same time.
There is also a big question of ambiguity.
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.
Moral ambiguity.
It is constantly there.
And, just as an example, this is one that recently came to me.
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq.
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved.
You know, maybe even 100 years.
So, there was another one that I came across, and it's "saving fish from drowning."
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say, because they're not supposed to kill anything.
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning, and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business, or you're going to get stuck.
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
And then we have intentions.
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do, and then we do something.
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
Maybe things go wrong.
And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?
What are we supposed to do?
Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?
That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called "Saving Fish From Drowning."
I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.
I got these hints everywhere.
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues, and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.
And when I have the question, it is a focus.
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.
And it seems like it's happening all the time.
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity, in which you're getting all this help from the universe.
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
And you are noticing it more often.
But you apply this.
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?
Why or why not?
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in Burma.
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show that I approved of the military regime there.
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself, "Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us?"
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up, and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father, who was a Baptist minister.
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals, so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at, and we talked about today, is genocide.
This leads to this question.
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe?
It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense, and yet it is also absolutely necessary.
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally, from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time, I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself, and that actually was the way it happened.
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.
There are also things, quite uncanny, which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.
In this case, I was writing a story that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.
And I took down this book, and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period, and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion, happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that, and a character who thought he was the son of God.
You wonder, are these things random chance?
Well, what is random?
What is chance?
What is luck?
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?
And that goes into the story, too.
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.
Especially when good things happen, and, in particular, when bad things happen.
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place, and we ended up in this non-tourist location, a beautiful village, pristine.
And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure.
And about 45 minutes later, walking along the beach, I came across this.
And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story, and I cannot explain it.
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things?
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?
A big thing that I also think about is accidents.
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.
What is the nature of accidents?
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are, outside of a court of law?
I was able to see that in a firsthand way, when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China.
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident.
A man, an old man, fell asleep, and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.
Responsibility was assigned to the family.
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.
It's the son, not the father."
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.
And I began to sense something different about the history, and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village, and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links with other families.
And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years.
And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition.
But after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen.
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
The book comes and it goes.
When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?
And how do I create my own life?
And I think it is by questioning, and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story, and the past, the specifics of that past, and what is happening in the story at that point.
I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe, and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.
And they have to be in all possibilities, including those I never considered before.
So, there are never complete answers.
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything, and that is good, because then I will discover something new.
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me, it is to simply imagine.
And to imagine is to put myself in that story, until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think, to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.
Because for everything, in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.
We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us.
There she is.
Thank you very much!
So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools.
And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with.
And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.
Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast.
And from those single points emanated stories.
Some of them were familiar stories.
Some of them were new stories.
And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium.
Think about episodes that happened live on radio.
Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format.
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.
And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world.
This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them.
There are thousands upon thousands of them.
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster.
We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods.
The short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.
One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called "Wool."
And he actually says that he didn't intend for "Wool" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more.
He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one, "Wool 3," which was even longer, culminating in "Wool 5," which was a 60,000-word novel.
I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books.
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order.
There was no mediator between him and the audience.
It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him.
So this whole project was an experiment.
It started with the one short story, and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format.
And that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called "Black Box."
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind.
Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created.
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.
Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.
Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.
I think that's pretty exciting: tune-in literary fiction.
The experience of Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.
You could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them.
They were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, The New Yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.
Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."
It began with this tweet: "On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."
It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.
when this woman falls to her death.
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives.
One reviewer called Elliott's story "Twitter fiction done right," because she did.
She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.
Interestingly, though, it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism.
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.
Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line.
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.
As you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world.
Things like Invisible Obama or the famous "binders full of women" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing," including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode.
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.
They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world.
They comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of Congress.
Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.
And they engage with the real world.
They respond to it.
So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account.
It was Mayor Emanuel.
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel, particularly in the expletive department.
This foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went.
It followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid Twitter parody account, but then started to get weird.
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is -- it didn't actually happen.
I double checked the newspapers.
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account.
It ended, a true narrative conclusion.
And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.
One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.
Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show.
Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird.
And there are all these times where Crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.
He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text.
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new.
There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way.
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.
Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.
I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.
RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day.
And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news.
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
I think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.
So with real-time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks.
They are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.
Thank you.

Il est entre dans mon coeur Une part de bonheur Dont je connais la cause. C'est lui pour moi. Et des que je l'apercois Alors je sens en moi Mon coeur qui bat
[Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children.
I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance.
Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards.
The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art.
But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008.
I heard the word "carcinoma."
Yes, breast cancer.
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade."
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school.
That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner.
As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear.
I thought I knew what fear was.
That day, I learned what fear was.
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
I said, "Is this it?
Is this the end of the road?
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best."
I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
So I dried my tears, and I declared to the world at large ...
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something.
I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there.
And I found that in my dance, my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion, my very life breath.
But it wasn't easy.
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days?
How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have.
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio, and learn everything I learned when I was four, all over again, reworked, relearned, regrouped.
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
Difficult.
I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself.
And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind.
But I needed something else.
I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga.
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful, her 18 arms ready for warfare, as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti.
Durga, the fearless one.
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own.
Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training, I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance, laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery.
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist.
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you.
My story is the power of thought.
My story is the power of choice.
It's the power of focus.
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
My story is the power of a metaphor.
It's the power of an image.
Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one.
She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror.
I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini."
Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks, as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing, checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.
And visiting some pretty incredible places, places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice -- I was here a month ago.
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.
You see some incredible stuff.
And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe.
And the thing that you really take away from that, the kind of surface thing that you take away from it, is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that, but rather how different we are.
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes.
You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that, and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.
How do we explain that diversity?
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took.
Now, the problem of human diversity, like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions.
And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.
First one is really a question of origins.
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?
And given that we do -- and that's the assumption everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that?
When did we originate as a species?
How long have we been divergent from each other?
And the second question is related, but slightly different.
If we do spring from a common source, how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe, and in the process generate all of this diversity, the different ways of life, the different appearances, the different languages around the world?
Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology, seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.
In "The Descent of Man," he wrote, "In each great region of the world, the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere."
So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question.
Well, not quite.
Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes.
And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.
Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time, due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.
Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago, and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.
The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia, became the gibbons and the orangutans.
And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.
So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes, it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.
But that's not really the question I'm asking.
I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room.
If they were peering over your shoulder, you wouldn't leap back, like that.
What about our human ancestry?
Because if we go far enough back, we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.
DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.
What we're asking about though is human ancestry.
How do we study that?
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.
Digging things up out of the ground, and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying, "This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.
This must be who I'm directly descended from."
The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue, gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry, but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.
What do I mean by that?
You're looking at a great example here.
These are three extinct species of hominids, potential human ancestors.
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.
And they're all dating to roughly the same time.
From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei, the robust australopithecine.
Three extinct species, same place, same time.
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently -- again, largely skull shape.
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet.
You think you've got a tough job?
And he did a pretty good job.
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said, "Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."
And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans, and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus," which basically included all the people he didn't like, including imaginary folk like elves.
It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-Darwinian era.
Except, if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity.
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago -- Carlton Coon is the best example -- had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era -- for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.
But based on what data?
Very little.
Very little.
Well, what I'm going to talk about today, what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.
Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry, digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors, and saying it on the basis of morphology -- which we still don't completely understand, we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation -- what we need to do is turn the problem on its head.
Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem, or a genealogical question.
What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
And as any genealogist will tell you -- anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?
You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common.
You and your cousins share a grandparent in common.
You gradually trace further and further back into the past, adding these ever more distant relationships.
But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records, and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.
A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors, and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.
Who were these people who came before?
We have no written record.
Well, actually, we do.
Written in our DNA, in our genetic code -- we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species.
And that's what we study.
Now, a quick primer on DNA.
I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.
It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
How long is it?
Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.
And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long.
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body, and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back, thousands of times.
It's a lot of information.
And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.
Imagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."
Now multiply it by 100.
And imagine copying that by hand.
And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake -- substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.
It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.
But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down through the generations, they become markers of descent.
If you share a marker with someone, it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past, the person who first had that change in their DNA.
And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation, the pattern of these markers in people all over the world, and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history, that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.
Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.
You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother, all the way back to the very first woman.
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men, traces a purely paternal line of descent.
Everybody in this room, everybody in the world, falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.
Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up.
What's the take-home message?
Well, the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa, among Africans.
That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer.
And what that means is that we originated in Africa.
It's written in our DNA.
Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.
Now, how recently do we share this ancestry?
Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?
No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.
Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person -- Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa, an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.
But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side, the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago.
That's only about 2,000 human generations, the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.
That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.
This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.
It's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.
Such an amazing story.
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.
Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?
Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species, or sub-species rather, human races around the world?
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?
Well, that's a big question.
These "why" questions, particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones, the ones that are tough to answer.
And so when all else fails, talk about the weather.
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.
Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold.
The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.
New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.
Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.
Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn -- and there aren't a lot of glaciers here, except on the high mountains here in East Africa.
So what was going on here?
We weren't covered in ice in Africa.
Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.
This is a paleo-climatological map of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago, reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.
If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.
So the whole world was drying out.
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.
The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today.
The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago, crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.
We nearly went extinct.
We were hanging on by our fingernails.
And then something happened.
A great illustration of it.
Look at some stone tools.
The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.
The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins, not our direct ancestors, living in Europe, and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.
Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience, basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.
The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.
The tool styles don't change that much.
The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period.
But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose.
Art makes its appearance.
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.
The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species, at particular times of the year.
The population size started to expand.
Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object -- that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.
We became much more social. The social networks expanded.
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.
Well, you want the ultimate African success story?
Look in the mirror.
You're it.
The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now, around 60, 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.
These would have been savannah hunters.
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.
And it's basically a meat locker.
People who would have specialized in killing the animals, hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up, following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago, during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands, because that's what they were adapted to live on.
And when they reached Central Asia, they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway, a grassland super-highway.
The grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age -- stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea, and the entire continent was open to them.
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago, and finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age -- temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps -- migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.
An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.
The changes that allowed us to do that, the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures, allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.
Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.
And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.
And as we were finishing up that film -- it was co-produced with National Geographic -- I started talking to the folks at NG about this work.
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, "You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA, and we want to take it to the next level.
What do you want to do next?"
Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.
And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.
We've just connected the dots.
What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more -- hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."
And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.
The project launched in April 2005.
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.
People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost.
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.
I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.
Where am I indigenous to?
Nowhere really.
My genes are all jumbled up.
But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.
That's the focus of the field research, the centers that we've set up all over the world -- 10 of them, top population geneticists.
But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.
In this case, you actually can.
You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.
You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.
And you can actually submit those results to the database, and tell us a little about your genealogical background, have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.
Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise, after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components, gets plowed back into the project.
The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.
It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.
They apply to this fund in order to do various projects, and I'll show you a couple of examples.
So how are we doing on the project?
We've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world.
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago, which has raised around five million dollars, the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.
We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.
Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone, preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza, language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.
So the project is going very, very well, and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.
Thank you very much.
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade, and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own.
And that was largely because there weren't any.
So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg.
A 1930s ship's lifeboat, which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England.
And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.
During the day, the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse, and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast.
So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power.
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs.
I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.
It's about Billie Holiday.
And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning.
But I know where she was.
She was with me on my lifeboat.
And she was hot.
Billie crept softly into my waking arms warm like a sip of sour mash Strange fruit for a sweet hunk of trash Panic at the stage door of Carnegie Hall "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" Must have left the building body and soul On a creaky piano stool tonight as the moon is my only witness She was breathing in my ear "This time it's love" But love is a loaded pistol By daybreak she's gone Over the frozen river, home Me and Johnny Walker See in the new age alone Stay with me again tonight Billie, time, time is a wily trickster Still an echo in my heart says, "This time it's love"
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.
I couldn't understand the starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people.
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do.
And when I was 12, I became an actor.
I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.
I was told I was dyslexic.
In fact, I have got qualifications.
I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get -- which was useful, obviously.
And so concern is where all of this comes from.
And then, being an actor, I was doing these different kinds of things, and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in really wasn't cutting it, that there surely had to be more.
And at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby, this wonderful nuclear physicist, and he said that media had a responsibility, that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward.
And that fascinated me, because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life.
And then I thought, well maybe I could do something.
Maybe I could become a filmmaker.
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference.
Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in.
So I started thinking about peace, and I was obviously, as I said to you, very much moved by these images, trying to make sense of that.
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on?
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.
But I realized that, having been messing around with structure as an actor, that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough, that there needed to be a mountain to climb, there needed to be a journey that I had to take.
And if I took that journey, no matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.
The point was that I would have something to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil?
Is the destruction of the world inevitable?
Should I have children?
Is that a responsible thing to do?
Etc., etc.
So I was thinking about peace, and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?
And that was when I had the idea.
There was no starting point for peace.
There was no day of global unity.
There was no day of intercultural cooperation.
There was no day when humanity came together, separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we're in this together, and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated, then that might be the key to humanity's survival.
That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day.
So obviously we didn't have any money.
I was living at my mom's place.
And we started writing letters to everybody.
You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do to fathom that out.
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day, the 21st of September?
And I wanted it to be the 21st of September because it was my granddad's favorite number.
He was a prisoner of war.
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.
It poisoned his blood.
He died when I was 11.
So he was like my hero.
And the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left, 23 came back, two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground.
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace.
So we began this journey, and we launched it in 1999.
And we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors, Nobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths, various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody.
And very quickly, some letters started coming back.
And we started to build this case.
And I remember the first letter.
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.
And of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail].
A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying, "This is an amazing thing. Come and see me.
I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace."
And we didn't have money for the flight.
And I rang Sir Bob Ayling, who was CEO of BA at the time, and said, "Mate, we've got this invitation.
Could you give me a flight?
Because we're going to go see him."
And of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing.
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward.
And actually, let me go back to that slide, because when we launched it in 1999 -- this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence -- we invited thousands of people.
Well not thousands -- hundreds of people, lots of people -- all the press, because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day, a peace day.
And we invited everybody, and no press showed up.
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family.
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing.
But it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing.
For me, it was really about the process.
It wasn't about the end result.
And that's the beautiful thing about the camera.
They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword.
I think the camera is.
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually.
So anyway, we began the journey.
And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.
I'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long, because every time I saw Kofi Annan, I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it, and that was kind of what was going on.
Yeah, I'm not worried about it now.
So Mary Robinson, she said to me, "Listen, this is an idea whose time has come.
This must be created."
Kofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground."
The OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim, said, "I must get the African countries involved."
Dr. Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace laureate, president now of Costa Rica, said, "I'll do everything that I can."
So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States.
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks, and so on and so on and so on -- while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense.
And then we were listening to the people.
We were documenting everywhere.
76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.
And I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone.
I've recorded 44,000 young people.
I've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.
I'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry, their art, their literature, their music, their sport, whatever it might be.
And we were listening to everybody.
And it was an incredibly thing, working with the U.N.
and working with NGOs and building this case.
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day.
And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was, the better chance we had of creating this day.
And it was this stuff, this, where I actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter.
It didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace.
The fact is that, if I tried and it didn't work, then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite -- until, it was in Somalia, picking up that young girl.
And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic, and that young boy who was a child soldier, who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop.
And that actually, at that moment something happened to me, which obviously made me go, "I'm going to document.
If this is the only film that I ever make, I'm going to document until this becomes a reality."
Because we've got to stop, we've got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that, as a young person, is confusing me.
I don't know how to get involved in that process.
And then on the seventh of September, I was invited to New York.
The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly, with 54 co-sponsors, the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day, the 21st of September, as a fixed calendar date, and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world.
Yeah, but there were hundreds of individuals, obviously, who made that a reality.
And thank you to all of them.
That was an incredible moment.
I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen.
And as I mentioned, when it started, we were at the Globe, and there was no press.
And now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story."
And suddenly, we started to institutionalize this day.
Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th to do a press conference.
And it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.
And I was waiting for him to come down, and I knew that he was on his way.
And obviously he never came down.
The statement was never made.
The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence.
And it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives, there and then subsequently all over the world.
It never happened.
And I remember thinking, "This is exactly why, actually, we have to work even harder.
And we have to make this day work.
It's been created; nobody knows.
But we have to continue this journey, and we have to tell people, and we have to prove it can work."
And I left New York freaked, but actually empowered.
And I felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did, then maybe we wouldn't see things like that.
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics.
I was showing the film, and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything.
It's not going to work; you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan; the Taliban won't listen, etc., etc.
It's just symbolism.
And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways, because it couldn't not work.
I'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank, India, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was, and they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity, we can move aid, we can vaccinate children.
Children can lead their projects.
They can unite. They can come together.
If people would stop, lives will be saved."
That's what I'd heard.
And I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about.
And so I went back to the United Nations.
I decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie.
And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years.
We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system, governments and NGOs, trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it, see if we could make it possible.
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously, I'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi, one of my heroes and mentors really, he managed to get UNICEF involved.
And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go."
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.
It was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan with UNAMA and WHO and civil society, etc., etc., etc. ?
But even if it doesn't, at least the door is open and there's a chance."
And so I went back to London, and I went and saw this chap, Jude Law.
And I saw him because he was an actor, I was an actor, I had a connection to him, because we needed to get to the press, we needed this attraction, we needed the media to be involved.
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas, maybe there would be more people interested.
And maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more, which had been desperately difficult.
So Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you."
While I was filming these statements, he said to me, "Where are you going next?"
I said, "I'm going to go to Afghanistan."
He said, "Really?"
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest.
So I said to him, "Do you want to come with me?
It'd be really interesting if you came.
It would help and bring attention.
And that attention would help leverage the situation, as well as all of the other sides of it."
I think there's a number of pillars to success.
One is you've got to have a great idea.
The other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance, and you've got to be able to raise awareness.
And actually I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved.
So these guys were absolutely crucial.
So he said yes, and we found ourselves in Afghanistan.
It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there, I was talking to various people, and they were saying to me, "You've got to get everybody involved here.
You can't just expect it to work.
I mean, we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with ministers of education, holding these press conferences, which of course, now were loaded with press, everybody was there.
There was an interest in what was going on.
This amazing woman, Fatima Gailani, was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians.
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere.
And she was really crucial in getting the message in.
And then we went home. We'd sort of done it.
We had to wait now and see what happened.
And I got home, and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the Taliban.
And that letter basically said, "We'll observe this day.
We will observe this day.
We see it as a window of opportunity.
And we will not engage.
We're not going to engage."
And that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn't be kidnapped or killed.
And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.
And days later, 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping.
And like the General Assembly, obviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back.
We put it into Dari and Pashto.
We put it in the local dialects.
We went back to Afghanistan, because the next year was coming, and we wanted to support.
But more importantly, we wanted to go back, because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.
They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it, etc., etc. -- and they made it real.
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say, "Look, you guys made this possible.
And thank you very much."
And we gave the film over.
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing.
And then that year, that year, 2008, this ISAF statement from Kabul, Afghanistan, September 17th: "General Stanley McChrystal, commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan, announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of September."
They were saying they would stop.
And then there was this other statement that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety saying that, in Afghanistan, because of this work, the violence was down by 70 percent.
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least.
And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything.
And I remember being stuck in New York, this time because of the volcano, which was obviously much less harmful.
And I was there thinking about what was going on.
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent.
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do.
And that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan, then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere.
We have to go for a global truce.
We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce, go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities, both domestically and internationally, ever recorded.
That's exactly what we must do.
And on the 21st of September this year, we're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process, to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities.
And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.
And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations.
And we'll globally link with government, inter-government, non-government, education, unions, sports.
And you can see the education box there.
We've got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce.
And obviously the life-saving is increased, the concepts help.
Linking up with the Olympics -- I went and saw Seb Coe. I said, "London 2012 is about truce.
Ultimately, that's what it's about."
Why don't we all team up?
Why don't we bring truce to life?
Why don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce?
We'll make a new film about this process.
We'll utilize sport and football.
On the Day of Peace, there's thousands of football matches all played, from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be.
So, utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action.
And ultimately, we have to try that.
We have to work together.
And when I stand here in front of all of you, and the people who will watch these things, I'm excited, on behalf of everybody I've met, that there is a possibility that our world could unite, that we could come together as one, that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues, brought about by individuals.
I was with Brahimi, Ambassador Brahimi.
I think he's one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics -- in Afghanistan, in Iraq.
He's an amazing man.
And I sat with him a few weeks ago.
And I said to him, "Mr. Brahimi, is this nuts, going for a global truce?
Is this possible?
Is it really possible that we could do this?"
He said, "It's absolutely possible."
I said, "What would you do?
Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system?"
He said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals."
It's all about the individuals.
It's all about you and me.
It's all about partnerships.
It's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses.
Because together, by working together, I seriously think we can start to change things.
And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is, who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal -- and he said, "I've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares, and one of them is white."
And it then made me think about a glass of water, which is clear.
If you put one drop, one drop of something, in that water, it'll change it forever.
By working together, we can create peace one day.
Thank you TED.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world, and I do that quite regularly.
And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places, I'm really struck by the things that we have in common.
They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful, to be healthy, and to have a successful life.
But I also see lots of poverty, and it's quite jarring, both in the scale and the scope of it.
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors, no running water, no electricity, and that's really what I see all over the world.
So in short, I'm startled by all the things that they don't have.
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have: Coca-Cola.
Coke is everywhere.
In fact, when I travel to the developing world, Coke feels ubiquitous.
And so when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development, and I'm flying home and I'm thinking, "We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations," you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder: how is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places?
If they can do that, why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.
But I think, as a community, we still have a lot to learn.
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day.
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week.
So why does this matter?
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector.
I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.
Coke's success is relevant, because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives.
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.
And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca-Cola.
They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product.
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent, and they do incredible marketing.
So let's start with the data.
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.
So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress.
They have this very continuous feedback loop.
They learn something, they put it back into the product, they put it back into the market.
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
It's a lot like other consumer companies.
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola, and you have a 107 constituencies, you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold, whether it was a corner store, a supermarket or a pushcart.
So if sales start to drop, then the person can identify the problem and address the issue.
Let's contrast that for a minute to development.
In development, the evaluation comes at the very end of the project.
I've sat in a lot of those meetings, and by then, it is way too late to use the data.
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on, and then you an see your impact."
Real-time data turns on the lights.
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?
They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent.
Coke's been in Africa since 1928, but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets, because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world, which was a large truck rolling down the street.
And in Africa, the remote places, it's hard to find a good road.
But Coke noticed something -- they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.
And they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs, giving them small loans.
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers, and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people, who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product.
There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa.
In Tanzania and Uganda, they represent 90 percent of Coke's sales.
Let's look at the development side.
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke?
Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well, because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors, and they know what motivates them to make change.
I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program.
The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic, they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it, to get to the health care center.
They decided that wasn't good enough, so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this, and they adapted it for Ethiopia.
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country.
They trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people.
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people.
Now, think about how this can change people's lives.
Health extension workers can help with so many things, whether it's family planning, prenatal care, immunizations for the children, or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery.
That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia, and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008.
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program.
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?
Well, they're already starting talk about this.
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas?
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages?"
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential.
The third component of Coke's success is marketing.
Ultimately, Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca-Cola.
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.
So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing?
Well, it's aspirational.
It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live.
So even though it's a global company, they take a very local approach.
Coke's global campaign slogan is "Open Happiness."
But they localize it.
And they don't just guess what makes people happy; they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life.
And in South Africa, they associate happiness with seriti or community respect.
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, "Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.
K'Naan: Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Give you freedom, give you fire Give you reason, take you higher See the champions take the field now You define us, make us feel proud In the streets our heads are lifted As we lose our inhibition Celebration, it's around us Every nation, all around us Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?
Well, they didn't stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages.
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries.
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," that also went number one on the pop charts.
Both songs have something in common: that same appeal of celebration and unity.
So how does health and development market?
Well, it's based on avoidance, not aspirations.
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.
And I think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption, that we think that, if people need something, we don't have to make them want that.
And I think that's a mistake.
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.
One example is sanitation.
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation.
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used.
People reuse it for a slab for their home.
They sometimes store grain in it.
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.
But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?
Well, you work with the community.
You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village, and they agree to that.
One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship.
And it works -- look at these headlines.
I'm not kidding.
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.
No loo, no "I do."
Now, it's not just a funny headline -- it's innovative.
It's an innovative marketing campaign.
But more importantly, it saves lives.
Take a look at this -- this is a room full of young men and my husband, Bill.
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?
They're waiting to be circumcised.
Can you you believe that?
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men.
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation, I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"
But it turns out the men do, because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it, and the men also believe it improves their sex life.
So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development, we can change communities and we can change whole nations.
Well, why is all of this so important?
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together, when you tie the three things together.
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.
So if you look back to 1988, there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year.
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.
Well how did that happen?
Let's look at a country like India.
They have over a billion people in this country, but they have 35,000 local doctors who report paralysis, and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.
They have two and a half million vaccinators.
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.
Let me tell you the story of Shriram, an 18 month boy in Bihar, a northern state in India.
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample, and by the 25th of August, it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.
By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
Now it could have come from one of two places.
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
Luckily, the genetic testing proved that, in fact, this strand came north, because, had it come from the south, it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
So many more people would have been affected.
So what's the endgame?
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign, which is what you do in polio.
They went out and where Shriram lives, they vaccinated two million people.
So in less than a month, we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program.
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.
That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading, and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands; they can save lives.
Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing, but it might not be what you think.
It's not the marketing on the ground.
It's not telling the parents, "If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated."
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years, but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer.
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money.
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational, if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease, we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us.
And if we could do that, we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide, in all of our countries for polio.
And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet.
And we are so close.
And this victory is so possible.
So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness, I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms.
To me, that is deep happiness.
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector, then in the future we make together, that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca-Cola.
Thank you.
The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere in an echo-free chamber.
Think of the AlloSphere as a large, dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer.
20 researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere, and be completely immersed in their data.
Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin.
Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material.
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain, as though it was a world, and see tissues as landscapes, and hear blood density levels as music.
This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.
But first a little bit about this group of artists, scientists, and engineers that are working together.
I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained, and the inventor of the AlloSphere.
With my visual artist colleagues, we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space, visually and sonically.
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information.
And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration.
I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin.
This first project is called the AlloBrain.
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.
You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.
Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically.
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.
You see 12 intelligent computer agents, the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.
They're mining blood density levels.
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.
Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain.
They're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.
We're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation.
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self-generation and growth: very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.
For artists, we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore.
These generative algorithms grow over time, and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.
Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code, which are computer programs, that allow these creatures to grow over time.
We're going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world, down into the atomic world, as we fly into a lattice of atoms.
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.
They've discovered a new bond, a new material for transparent solar cells.
We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms -- oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.
You view the bond in the triangle.
It's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom.
You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists.
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.
The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms.
We've mapped them into the audio domain, so they're singing to you.
Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.
We're going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom.
We're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n-dimensional Schrödinger equation in time.
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration, and you're going to notice a pulsing.
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.
This is actually a light emitter.
As the sound starts to pulse and contract, our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.
They're starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations.
And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.
We're going to move even further down, and go to one single electron spin.
This will be the final project that I show you.
Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin.
We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it.
You're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow.
This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology.
So these brief examples that I've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to bring together, arts, science and engineering into a new age of math, science and art.
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.
Thank you very much.
I essentially drag sledges for a living, so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually, but I'm going to read this question from an interview earlier this year: "Philosophically, does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving?
After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone, and we can participate virtually, then why bother leaving the house?"
I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.
I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle, so I get out of the house a fair bit.
And in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things, and it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action that I'm going to try and explore briefly.
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt. Everest.
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest, more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.
No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery.
But he was credited with coining the phrase, "Because it's there."
Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that.
There's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say is actually far nicer, and again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.
"The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this: What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest?
And my answer must at once be, it is no use.
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.
Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation, but otherwise nothing will come of it.
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, and not a gem, nor any coal or iron.
So it is no use.
If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go.
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy, and joy, after all, is the end of life.
We don't live to eat and make money.
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.
That is what life means, and that is what life is for."
Mallory's argument that leaving the house, embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun, however, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience.
The furthest I've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly what came over me, but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.
I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole, and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada.
No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.
A lot of experts were saying it was impossible, and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea.
The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point, the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean, took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down, you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension, as I sat in a helicopter thundering north, and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into.
There was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.
I was 26.
I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge.
I had my skis ready to go, I had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear.
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn, and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.
I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter.
Beyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.
The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea, so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean.
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.
I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies, about 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks was minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest.
So again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.
One of the magical things about this journey, however, is that because I'm walking over the sea, over this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux.
The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around, refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever, possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.
And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house.
I can try to tell you what it was like, but you'll never know what it was like, and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely, I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles, it was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day, the more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.
And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing, you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor, rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where the real meat of life is to be found, the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.
And I would add a cautionary note here, however.
In my experience, there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible.
Now I don't just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring-do, but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer, there is something addictive about this, and in my case, I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit.
I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it, but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on, to ruin every relationship I've ever had, so be careful what you wish for.
Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain, and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something in the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly in the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.
There is one unfinished challenge that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life.
Many of you will know the story.
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole.
No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica.
Scott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team, who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot, all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges, and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there, I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.
All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey.
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.
When I talk about Antarctica, people often say, "Hasn't, you know, that's interesting, hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?"
Or, "That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know.
Is there a chance you'll see her there?"
But Scott's journey remains unfinished.
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again.
It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration, and it seemed to me high time, given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job.
So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.
This time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.
It will take us about four months to make this return journey.
That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.
We have to turn around and come back again.
I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before.
And it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question, "Why?"
And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option.
If I wanted to know, for example, how many stars were in the Milky Way, how old those giant heads on Easter Island were, most of you could find that out right now without even standing up.
And yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places, it is that true, real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge, from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown.
In life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to, and I think metaphorically speaking, at least, we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside.
Thank you very much.
About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius.
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished, all within about 150 years.
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find, because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton.
See, while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody -- not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo.
Well, this isn't exactly true.
The fact is, is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century -- it was actually mummified, skin and all -- but in a fit of space-saving zeal, they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire.
The frontispiece of this article was this photo, and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker, because this photo completely rocked my world.
I became obsessed with the object -- not just the beautiful photograph itself, and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible, the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together -- there's an entire story here.
And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton?
I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell, and this was the very latest one.
No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my "Creative Projects" folder -- it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.
Any time I have an internet connection, there's a sluice of stuff moving into there, everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille.
This folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it's growing constantly.
And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been maybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids, and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day.
I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.
And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought, maybe, yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.
I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor; I'm a hard-edged model maker.
You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate, you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" -- especially parts from "Star Wars" -- I can do this stuff all day long.
It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.
But you give me something like this -- my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this; it's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" -- this is not my thing -- this is something other people do -- dragons, soft things.
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it -- I mean, it couldn't be that difficult.
So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.
I grabbed all the reference, and I found this lovely piece of reference.
This is someone selling this on eBay; it was clearly a woman's hand, hopefully a woman's hand.
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand, I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that, along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be, exactly how long, etc.
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I -- it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton; I just noticed that as I finished this skull, the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.
And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.
I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.
And so button by button, vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.
And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull, a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.
And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference, every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.
This guy -- I love this guy!
He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler.
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted, and I replicated every last bone and put it in.
And after about six weeks, I finished, painted, mounted my own dodo skeleton.
You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo.
And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it -- a museum vitrine.
Again, like I said, my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell, and also making them for myself, obtaining them, appreciating them and diving into them.
And in this folder, "Creative Projects," there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on, projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day, and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch.
But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different, that I -- you know, I have my own R2D2, but that's -- honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.
And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder, and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.
Now, this is funny for me: to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel, because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people, Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.
But in this case, it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story, it's about the object in and of itself.
And in this case, this object is -- plays on a host of levels.
First of all, there's the object in the world.
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk."
It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a Swedish Count, and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.
Built out of words, it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie, in which another object is created: a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words, inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.
And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire.
And so now it was time to do some research.
I actually had done some research a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.
I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the Maltese Falcon on eBay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference.
But I discovered, in researching further, really wanting precise reference, that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in 1994, and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue, and in it I found this magnificent picture, which included a size reference.
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan, a New Jersey editor, actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991, although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications, because there was a lot of controversy about it.
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made.
It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it, because I can see it compared to this thing, and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing, it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.
In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial, Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this -- I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars -- they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom -- not just a front elevation, but also a side, rear and other side elevation.
So now, I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon.
What do they do, how do you start something like that?
I really don't know.
So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull, I blew all my reference up to full size, and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references.
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it, and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.
And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail, I worked out and achieved -- working in front of the television and Super Sculpey -- here's me sitting next to my wife -- it's the only picture I took of the entire process.
As I moved through, I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.
But again, I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like, I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey; I certainly wasn't able to get it.
So, I went down to my shop, and I molded it and I cast it in resin, because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.
Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.
My preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer.
I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell, but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass-smooth.
Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end, and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.
And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.
I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.
And it's beautiful.
And I can state with authority at this point in time, when I'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you, is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.
This is where it gets weird.
Now, James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon, killed James Elroy's mother.
I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974, during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon," called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon -- one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum.
A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie.
John's Grill, which actually is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon," is still a viable San Francisco eatery, counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook, who played Wilmer Cook in the movie, and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years, until it got stolen in January of 2007.
It looked really great, the light worked on it really well, it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world.
But there was a problem. And the problem was that: I wanted the entirety of the object, I wanted the weight behind the object.
This thing was made of resin and it was too light.
There's this group online that I frequent.
It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade, make and travel in information about movie props.
And it turned out that one of the guys there, a friend of mine that I never actually met, but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.
He took my master Falcon pattern, he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me, and this is the bronze I got back.
And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.
And this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.
Here, I'm going to put it out there, later on tonight, and I want you to pick it up and handle it.
You want to know how obsessed I am.
This project's only for me, and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper, in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
like it is in the movie.
Yeah, I know!
There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.
That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.
But there's a problem.
Now, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.
There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon, because I had to get it back out of the mold.
There's my first casting, there's my master and there's my bronze.
There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things, which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin, you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one, it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah -- why didn't I remember this?
Why didn't I start and make it bigger?
So what do I do?
I figure I have two options.
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it, which I have already done, to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3D lithography master of this, which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze.
Or: There are several people who own originals, and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them, hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture, or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box, and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear, get a perfect 3D scan.
And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.
But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves, I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.
Thank you.
I'm a process engineer.
I know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that, but I also have Marfan syndrome.
This is an inherited disorder.
And in 1992 I participated in a genetic study and found to my horror, as you can see from the slide, that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range, the green line at the bottom.
Everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm.
I was already up at 4.4.
And as you can see, my aorta dilated progressively, and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary.
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome -- anesthetize you, open your chest, put you on an artificial heart and lung machine, drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade, stop your heart, cut the aorta out, replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta, and, most importantly, commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy, normally warfarin.
The thought of the surgery was not attractive.
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening.
So I said to myself, I'm an engineer, I'm in R and D, this is just a plumbing problem.
I can do this.
I can change this.
So I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation.
The project aim is really quite simple.
The only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with Marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength.
So the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe.
And it would remain stable and operate quite happily.
If your high-pressure hose pipe, or your high-pressure hydraulic line, bulges a little, you just wrap some tape around the outside of it.
It really is that simple in concept, though not in execution.
The great advantage of an external support for me was that I could retain all of my own bits, all of my own endothelium and valves, and not need any anticoagulation therapy.
So where do we start?
Well this is a sagittal slice through me.
You could see in the middle that device, that little structure, squeezing out.
Now that's a left ventricle pushing blood up through the aortic valve -- you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there -- up into the ascending aorta.
And it's that part, the ascending aorta, which dilates and ultimately bursts, which, of course, is fatal.
We started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance imaging machines and CT imaging machines from which to make a model of the patient's aorta.
This is a model of my aorta.
I've got a real one in my pocket, if anyone would like to look at it and play with it.
You can see, it's quite a complex structure.
It has a funny trilobal shape at the bottom, which contains the aortic valve.
It then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off.
So it's quite a difficult structure to produce.
This, like I say, is a CAD model of me, and this is one of the later CAD models.
We went through an iterative process of producing better and better models.
When we produced that model we turn it into a solid plastic model, as you can see, using a rapid prototyping technique, another engineering technique.
We then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh, which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta.
So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really.
Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant.
Once you've made it, the installation's quite easy.
John Pepper, bless his heart, professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in, didn't like it, took it out, put the second one in.
Happy, away I went.
Four and a half hours on the table and everything was done.
So the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part.
If you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative, the so-called composite aortic root graft, there are one of two startling comparisons, which I'm sure will be clear to all of you.
Two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the existing treatment.
The existing treatment requires, as I've said, the heart and lung bypass machine and it requires a total body cooling.
We don't need any of that; we work on a beating heart.
He opens you up, he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating, all at the right temperature.
No breaking into your circulatory system.
So it really is great.
But for me, absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy required.
I don't take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that I would choose to take.
And in fact, if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin, it is a serious compromise to your quality of life.
And even worse, it inevitably foreshortens your life.
Likewise, if you have the artificial valve option, you're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment at all.
Even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics, in case you get an internal infection on the valve.
Again, I don't have any of that, so I'm entirely free.
My aorta is fixed, I haven't got to worry about it, which is a rebirth for me.
Back to the theme of the presentation: In multidisciplinary research, how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life?
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team.
This is a list of the core team.
And as you can see, there are not only two principal technical disciplines there, medicine and engineering, but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines.
John Pepper there was the cardiac surgeon who did the actual work on me, but everyone else there had to contribute one way or another.
Raad Mohiaddin, medical radiologist: We had to get good quality images from which to make the CAD model.
Warren Thornton, who still does all our CAD models for us, had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set.
There are some problems with it.
Jargon is a big one.
I would think no one in this room understands those four first jargon points there.
The engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and CAD.
The medics amongst you, if there are any, will recognize the first two.
But there will be nobody else in this room that understands all of those four words.
Taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used.
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well.
We took a lot of horizontal slice images through me, produced those slices and then used those to build a CAD model.
And the very first CAD model we made, the surgeons were playing with the plastic model, couldn't quite figure it out.
And then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta.
And it was a mirror image because in the real world we always look down on plans, plans of houses or streets or maps.
In the medical world they look up at plans.
So the horizontal images were all an inversion.
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions.
Everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not assumed.
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project.
The Brompton Hospital was taken over by Imperial College's School of Medicine, and there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations.
I was working with Imperial and the Brompton, and this generated some serious problems with the project, really problems that shouldn't exist.
Research and ethics committee: If you want to do anything new in surgery, you have to get a license from your local research and ethics.
I'm sure it's the same in Poland.
There will be some form of equivalent, which licenses new types of surgery.
We didn't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that, was also had professional jealousies.
There were people on the research and ethics committee who really didn't want to see John Pepper succeed again, because he's so successful.
And they made extra problems for us.
Bureaucratic problems: Ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a guidance note going out for all of the hospitals in the country.
In the U.K. we have the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, NICE.
You'll have an equivalent in Poland, no doubt.
We had to get past the NICE problem.
We now have a great clinical guidance out on the Net.
So any of the hospitals interested can come along, read the NICE report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves.
Funding barriers: Another big area to be concerned with.
A big problem with understanding one of those perspectives: When we first approached one of the big U.K. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff, what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal.
They didn't understand it; they were doctors, they were next to God.
It must be rubbish.
They binned it.
So in the end I went to private investors and I just gave up on it.
But most R and D is going to be institutionally funded, by the Polish Academy of Sciences or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council or whatever, and you need to get past those people.
Jargon is a huge problem when you're trying to work across disciplines, because in an engineering world, we all understand CAD and R.P. -- not in the medical world.
I suppose ultimately the funding bureaucrats have really got to get their act together.
They've really got to start talking to each other, and they've got to exercise a bit of imagination, if that's not too much to ask -- which it probably is.
I've coined a phrase "obstructive conservatism."
So many people in the medical world don't want to change, particularly not when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer.
They don't want to change.
They simply want to do whatever they've done before.
And in fact, there are many surgeons in the U.K.
still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of episode, so that they can say, "Ah, I told you that was no good."
We've got 90 post-op patient years between us, and we haven't had a single problem.
And still, there are people in the U.K. saying, "Yeah, that external aortic root, yeah, it'll never work, you know."
It really is a problem.
It really is a problem.
I'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics, doctors, surgeons at some point.
The middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves.
"Yeah, well of course, I'm looking after my patient."
I think it's not good, but there you are, that's my view.
Egos, of course, again, a huge problem If you're working in a multidisciplinary team, you've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt.
You've got to express support for them.
Tom Treasure, professor of cardiothoracic surgery: incredible guy.
Dead easy to give him respect.
Him giving me respect?
Slightly different.
That's all the bad news.
The good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge.
Translate that one.
I bet they can't.
When you have a group of people who have had a different professional training, a different professional experience, they not only have a different knowledge base, but they have a different perspective on everything.
And if you can bring those guys together and you can get them talking and understanding each other, the results can be spectacular.
You can find novel solutions, really novel solutions, that have never been looked at before very, very quickly and easily.
You can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have.
And as a result, it's an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you.
The result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets.
I'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that I'm not prepared to tell you what it cost.
Because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the USA which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality.
That's all I want to say, and I've got three minutes left.
So Heather's going to like me.
If you have any questions, please come up and talk to me later on.
It would be a pleasure to speak with you.
Many thanks.
I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.
And I specialize in human behavioral research, and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways, and to design for that future.
And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years, and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.
But I've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there.
This is my office. It's out there.
It's not in the lab, and it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.
We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people.
About three billion people, by the end of this year, will have cellular connectivity.
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.
And I mention this because, if we want to design for that future, we need to figure out what those people are about.
And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is and what our team's job is.
Our research often starts with a very simple question.
So I'll give you an example. What do you carry?
If you think of everything in your life that you own, when you walk out that door, what do you consider to take with you?
When you're looking around, what do you consider?
Of that stuff, what do you carry?
And of that stuff, what do you actually use?
So this is interesting to us, because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.
And to put it really bluntly, you know, people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?
So I've probably done about five years' research looking at what people carry.
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.
I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide, and we follow them around town with video cameras.
It's kind of like stalking with permission.
And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question, what do people carry?
And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.
OK, that's fair enough.
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys, money and, if they own one, a mobile phone.
And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.
You'd probably kick me out, or something.
OK, it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.
But really, the question is, why? Right?
So why are these things so important in our lives?
And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones.
So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth -- transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.
And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.
If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff, but they're very good at this.
And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability to allow people to transcend space and time.
And what I mean by that is, you know, you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience, and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.
And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out, which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.
And they value that connectivity.
But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.
And you can do them with phone kiosks.
And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.
You don't need to ask permission from anyone, you can just go ahead and do it, right?
We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.
I think, quite a nice feature.
So we forget, but we're also adaptable, and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.
And so we have these strategies to remember, and one of them was mentioned yesterday.
And it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.
And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space, and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.
Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.
And you turn around, and you look back into the space, and some people talk aloud.
And pretty much everyone does it at some point.
OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life, and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels, but most people have what we call a center of gravity.
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity, but over time, they gravitate there.
It's where you expect to find stuff.
And in fact, when you're turning around, and you're looking inside the house, and you're looking for this stuff, this is where you look first, right?
OK, so when we did this research, we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way to never forget anything ever, ever again.
And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.
OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?
But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.
And from a design perspective, it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people.
And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be -- can be the solution for pretty much everything, apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.
You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.
And apart from things like entertainment, you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf, or, at least, not yet.
Maybe sometime in the future, we will.
So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.
So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate.
So, the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures -- that there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.
So, we've been conducting a lot of research.
And one of the things we were looking at is -- if you can't read and write, if you want to communicate over distances, you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with.
It could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address, it could be a postal address.
Simple question: if you can't read and write, how do you manage your contact information?
And the fact is that millions of people do it.
Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it, and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing.
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people, the stuff that they can't do themselves.
Let me give you another example of delegation.
This one's a little bit more sophisticated, and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.
OK?
And it works like this.
So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.
I'm sending money back, and it works like this.
So, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone, and that's the phone kiosk operator.
And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.
So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone, I call up the local village operator.
And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.
So, they're topping up the value from Kampala, and it's now being topped up in the village.
You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission, and passes the rest over to you in cash.
OK, there's two things I like about this.
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an ATM machine.
It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there's no banking infrastructure.
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure, they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers, because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.
There's a second thing I like about this.
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal, and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication, I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?
And, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.
But the difference between this and that is, there's no central authority trying to control this.
This is just street-up innovation.
So, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of inspiration for us.
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.
They'll give you a new one.
They'll probably give you three new ones, right?
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.
If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks, and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.
This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China, and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together.
They reverse-engineer manuals.
This is a kind of hacker's manual, and it's written in Chinese and English.
They also write them in Hindi.
You can subscribe to these.
There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well.
But what I like about this is, it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface, a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.
And it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.
And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff, and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.
It challenges the norms.
OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.
Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.
But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process.
And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply, for example, for the design of -- the lessons from this -- apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?
This is a pair of underpants from -- -- from Tibet.
And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know, why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?
And I look at something like this and it makes me question, if we were to take all the functionality in things like this, and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network, how would we prioritize where to put stuff?
And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks.
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda.
This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.
So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?
When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?
Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK, for those extra three billion people.
This is how it's shifting.
And then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.
And this is from Delhi.
It's from a study we did into illiteracy, and it's a guy in a teashop.
You can see the chai being poured in the background.
And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker, on the lowest rungs in the society.
And he, somehow, has the appreciation of the values of Livestrong.
And it's not necessarily the same values, but some kind of values of Livestrong, to actually go out and purchase them, and actually display them.
For me, this kind of personifies this connected world, where everything is intertwined, and the dots are -- it's all about the dots joining together.
OK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences," and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner, right?
When everyone's connected.
And there are four things.
So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas, the speed at which ideas go around.
And I know TED is about big ideas, but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.
If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet, that's the first thing.
The second thing is the immediacy of objects.
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller, as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking, identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid, in a way that we just totally cannot conceive, when you get it to 6.3 billion and the growth in the world's population.
The next thing is that, however we design this stuff -- carefully design this stuff -- the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate, as long as it meets base needs -- the ability to transcend space and time, for example.
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.
In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.
That's my feeling.
And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on, and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design.
And the last thing is that -- actually, the direction of the conversation.
With another three billion people connected, they want to be part of the conversation.
And I think our relevance and TED's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.
And we need to learn how to listen.
So thank you very, very much.
I write about food.
I take it quite seriously, but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two.
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?
But I still think that this -- -- may be this year's version of this.
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.
And why do I say it?
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined.
There was the bomb, and there's now.
And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives, but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now, we'd recognize it.
It's a holocaust of a different kind, and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.
Start with the notion that global warming is not only real, but dangerous.
Since every scientist in the world now believes this, and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to, we can take this is a given.
Then hear this, please.
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases.
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production -- more than transportation.
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts, but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2, and it's not just methane.
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation, air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.
There's more.
Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people, but to animals.
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this: if you're a progressive, if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green, or you're looking for organic, you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom, but it's all in the way we use these things.
There's another piece of the puzzle, which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday, and one you already know.
There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world.
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day -- our demand for these things, not our need, our want, drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.
And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.
Now global warming was unforeseen.
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there, but, you know, that's not such a big deal.
The current health crisis, however, is a little more the work of the evil empire.
We were told, we were assured, that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate, the healthier we'd be.
No.
Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food, is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear -- it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.
Not bad.
But back to animals and junk food.
What do they have in common?
One: we don't need either of them for health.
We don't need animal products, and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.
Two: both have been marketed heavily, creating unnatural demand.
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.
Now, let's imagine a parallel.
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy, while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy, knowing all the while that the result would be pollution, war and rising costs.
Incredible, isn't it?
Yet they do that.
And they do this here.
It's the same deal.
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail.
Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness, or they are puppets of agribusiness.
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs.
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others, and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food.
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.
And guess what?
Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness.
So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets -- these are not solutions.
But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local, or whether we're being nice to animals, the most important issues just aren't being addressed.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches.
But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.
That's our number.
10 billion.
If you strung all of them -- chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon, they'd go there and back five times, there and back.
Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good, and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long, but you get the idea.
That's just the United States.
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease, kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.
Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down, and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore," which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.
Seriously.
And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.
Between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision, you have two versions of how to improve our eating.
They both get it wrong, though.
The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.
And I'm going to go through that, at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.
A hundred years ago, guess what?
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby, and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.
And those moms bought and prepared food.
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.
Margarine didn't exist.
In fact, when margarine was invented, several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink, so we'd all know that it was a fake.
There was no snack food, and until the '20s, until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.
There were no restaurant chains.
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people, but none of them would think to open another one.
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.
And fancy food was entirely French.
As an aside, those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.
Back in those days, before even Julia, back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.
You just ate.
You didn't claim to be anything.
There was no marketing.
There were no national brands.
Vitamins had not been invented.
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.
You ate food.
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient, because it was an ingredient.
The cornflake hadn't been invented.
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.
Goldfish swam.
It's hard to imagine.
People grew food, and they ate food.
And again, everyone ate local.
In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present, because it came all the way from Florida.
From the '30s on, road systems expanded, trucks took the place of railroads, fresh food began to travel more.
Oranges became common in New York.
The South and West became agricultural hubs, and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle, as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.
Thus arrived convenience.
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework.
Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 -- their mouths are watering at this point.
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?
But this may have cut down on housework, but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.
I, for one -- and I'm not kidding -- didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.
Who needed it though?
Meat was everywhere.
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak?
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.
Rather than spending their lives eating grass, for which their stomachs were designed, they were forced to eat soy and corn.
They have trouble digesting those grains, of course, but that wasn't a problem for producers.
New drugs kept them healthy.
Well, they kept them alive.
Healthy was another story.
Thanks to farm subsidies, the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress, soy, corn and cattle became king.
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.
It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began, the thing we're only realizing just now.
Listen to this, between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.
Meat consumption increased five-fold.
Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.
And this took care of the situation resoundingly.
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups, because all of them could be bought at any store.
Not that they were any good, but they were there.
Most moms cooked like mine: a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing, canned soup, canned fruit salad.
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes, or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.
It wasn't all bad.
By the '70s, forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients.
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food, we knew or we were vegetarians.
We weren't all hippies, either.
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.
Meanwhile, food production had become industrial.
Industrial.
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally, as if it were plastic, food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.
Many people became fat-phobic.
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.
Instead they were sold on yogurt, yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.
Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.
Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.
You think that that might be healthy food, but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list, it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.
Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma, if not actually killed -- the beginning of the heyday of value-added food, which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it.
Think of the frozen chicken nugget.
The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up, and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder, and then it's fried in corn oil.
All you do is nuke it.
What could be better?
And zapped horribly, pathetically.
By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets -- and we all have our favorites, actually -- made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home.
At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce, and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden.
So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights, you've got your grazing nights, you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.
Leading the way -- what's leading the way?
Meat, junk food, cheese: the very stuff that will kill you.
So, now we clamor for organic food.
That's good.
And as evidence that things can actually change, you can now find organic food in supermarkets, and even in fast-food outlets.
But organic food isn't the answer either, at least not the way it's currently defined.
Let me pose you a question.
Can farm-raised salmon be organic, when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?
And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever, dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?
I don't know.
Packed in Styrofoam, of course, before landing somewhere in the United States, and then being trucked a few hundred more miles.
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.
Now here is where we all meet.
The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians, the vegans, the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food.
Even though we've come to this from different points, we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food.
We need to start acting.
And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said -- and, of course, she's completely right -- but it's also one of global survival.
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue, the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.
As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production.
How much livestock do you need to produce this?
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth, 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat.
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.
And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now, it's not going to be 40 years.
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.
The most common argument is that we need nutrients -- even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.
What do you think we eat per day?
Half a pound.
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?
Isn't meat eating essential to health?
Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?
Some of us might think that would be a good thing.
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players, the answer is no.
In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth, and many will make you much healthier than ours does.
We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition, we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat 50 percent less meat -- it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.
It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen, and what progressive people, forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating, along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.
During that time, I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything.
I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure, but I do think that for the benefit of everyone, the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly.
Ann Cooper's right.
The USDA is not our ally here.
We have to take matters into our own hands, not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone -- and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.
And that happens to be quite easy.
Less meat, less junk, more plants.
It's a simple formula: eat food.
Eat real food.
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well, and we can eat even better.
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love, and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.
We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.
We can make food more important, not less, and save ourselves by doing so.
We have to choose that path.
Thank you.
I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.
And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you.
So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are, and build a relationship with you.
I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.
So, it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight.
The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen.
One is hierarchical pores, and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.
There he's starting to walk.
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
I built the head. They built the body.
So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy.
We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego.
They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making.
It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.
We're emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine.
And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.
In fact, right now -- plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.
Okay. So I'm smiling.
Now I'm frowning.
And this is really heavily backlit.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, it's so sad.
Okay, so you smile, frowning.
So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right?
Those machines have no place for empathy.
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.
Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy.
So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future.
So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.
And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.
This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.
And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people.
So, we're involving two things.
One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.
You start to believe that it's alive and aware.
So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."
In these stories, robots often think that they're human, and they sort of come to life.
So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.
And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.
And we're getting this mass-manufactured.
We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.
As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.
Thank you so much.
That's incredible.
For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.
And I'm here today to give you a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed, through what I'm doing now.
I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.
I've been doing that for about 10 years.
I have a monthly puzzle calendar.
I do toys.
The bulk of my work is in computer games.
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."
I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.
So, very first puzzle, sixth grade, my teacher said, "Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.
I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board."
I thought this was a great assignment.
And so here is what I came up with.
I start fiddling with it.
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once.
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?
One hint: It's not "L."
It could be an "L," of course.
So, what else could it be?
Yeah, a lot of you got it.
Oh yeah. So, clever thing.
Now, that was my first puzzle.
I got hooked.
I created something new, I was very excited because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles, but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.
This was something really original.
I got hooked.
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer.
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems, which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.
You know, they might have a solution.
It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.
Who designed this?
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies.
Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer; many puzzles have more than one.
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games -- by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.
You can create one out of Legos.
Or competitive games like chess where, well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle, but the goal really is to beat another player.
It goes back as long as there is written history.
It's a very small form, like a joke, a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression.
The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.
So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games, is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.
I'll show you how.
Here is a famous one.
So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.
This is called a figure-ground illusion.
The artist M.C. Escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints.
Here we have "Day and Night."
Here is what I did with figure and ground.
So, here we have "figure" in black.
Here we have "figure" in white.
And it's all part of the same design.
The background to one is the other.
Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."
But I couldn't do that, I realized.
I changed the problem.
It's all "figure."
A few other things.
Here is my name.
And that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."
These sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."
I'll show you just a couple others.
Here we have the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.
Each letter here is one of these digits.
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.
Here's the word "mirror."
No, it's not the same upside-down.
It's the same this way.
And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.
And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.
And recently in Magic magazine I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.
This appears in my puzzle calendar.
Okay, let's go back to the slides.
Thank you very much.
Now, those are fun to look at.
Now how would you do it interactively?
For a while I was an interface designer.
And so I think a lot about interaction.
Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion, make the thing on the right.
Now, if you could pick up the black vase, it would look like the figure on top.
If you could pick up the white area, it would look like the figure on the bottom.
Well, you can't do that physically, but on a computer you can do it.
Let's switch over to the P.C.
And here it is, figure-ground.
The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right.
And this follows the rules I just said: any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.
But that is also true of any white area.
So, here we got the white area in the middle, and you can pick it up.
I'll just go one step further.
So, here is -- here is a couple pieces.
Move them together, and now this is an active piece.
You can really get inside somebody's perception and have them experience something.
It's like the old maxim of "you can tell somebody something and show them, but if they do it they really learn it."
Here is another thing you can do.
There is a game called Rush Hour.
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube.
So, here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place.
The goal is to get the red car out.
It's a sliding block puzzle.
It's made by the company Think Fun.
It's done very well.
I love this puzzle.
Well, let's play one.
So, here is a very simple puzzle.
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.
Okay, so how would you solve this one?
Well, move the blue one out of the way.
Here, let's make it a little harder.
Still pretty easy.
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.
Now, this one is a little bit trickier.
You know?
What do you do here?
The first move is going to be what?
You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.
Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.
I wanted to make a sequel.
I didn't come up with the original idea.
But this is another way I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.
I came up with this.
This is Railroad Rush Hour.
It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece, a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.
In the other game the cars can only move forward and back.
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.
Now I'm making it available to schools.
And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles, but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.
So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them.
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.
You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.
In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.
I got interested in gene sequencing.
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA?"
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces, and then you look for overlaps, and you basically match them at the edges.
And I said, "This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."
So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.
And it has to be solvable in a magazine.
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.
So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.
There is only one solution.
It's not that hard.
But it takes some persistence.
And when you're done, it makes this design, which, if you squint, is the word "helix."
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content, rather than the other way around.
Here is a couple more.
Here is a physics-based puzzle.
Which way will these fall?
One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.
And depending on which one weighs which amount, they'll fall different directions.
And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.
I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black, the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations, and you get these peculiar pictures.
Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures?
Gets you thinking about color.
Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com, website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.
She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.
So, we're making smart games for social media.
I'll explain what that means.
We're looking at three trends.
This is what's going on in the games industry right now.
First of all, you know, for a long time computer games meant things like "Doom," where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast, aimed at teenage boys.
Right?
That's who plays computer games.
Well, guess what?
That's changing.
"Bejeweled" is a big hit.
It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games.
And the main players are over 35, and are female.
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.
And it's a game you play with other people.
It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.
Now, within that there is some interesting things happening.
There is also a trend towards games that are good for you.
Why?
Well, we aging Boomers, Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food, we're exercising.
What about our minds?
Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's.
We better do something.
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.
A lot of people do Sudoku.
In fact some doctors prescribe it.
And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.
Everybody now considers themselves a creator, and not just a viewer.
And what does this add up to?
Here is what we see coming.
It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.
They're part of your life.
They're not necessarily a separate thing.
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.
I'm a puzzle guy.
My wife is an expert in social media.
And we decided to combine our skills.
Our first game is called "Photo Grab."
The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.
This is your first time playing my game.
Okay.
Let's see how well we can do.
There are three images.
And we have 24 seconds each.
Where is that?
I'll play as fast as I can.
But if you can see it, shout out the answer.
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?
Oh, yeah.
There, okay.
J-O and -- I guess that's that part.
We got the bow.
That bow helps.
That's his hair.
You get a lot of figure-ground problems.
Yeah, that one is easy.
So, ahhh!
Okay on to the next one.
Okay, so that's the lens.
Anybody?
Looks like a black shape.
So, where is that?
That's the corner of the whole thing.
Yeah, I've played this image before, but even when I make up my own puzzles -- and you can put your own images in here.
And we have people all over the world doing that now.
There we are.
Visit ShuffleBrain.com if you want to try it yourself.
Thank you.
This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School.
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects, and be trusted.
Trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others.
Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum, and there are no tests.
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.
When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff: wood and nails and rope and wheels, and lots of tools, real tools.
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.
And within that context, we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives.
Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived, and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around.
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.
And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -- and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success, or gleeful calamity.
We start from doodles and sketches.
And sometimes we make real plans.
And sometimes we just start building.
Building is at the heart of the experience: hands on, deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand.
Robin and I, acting as collaborators, keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion.
Success is in the doing, and failures are celebrated and analyzed.
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear.
When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities, a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.
Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation.
From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before.
All materials are available for use.
Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined.
And the things that they build amaze even themselves.
Three, two, one, go!
Gever Tulley: A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds.
Yay!
GT: Thank you.
It's been a great pleasure.
I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.
I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada, and dropped out of high school.
I don't own a cell phone, and I paint on paper using gouache, which hasn't changed in 600 years.
But about three years ago I had an art show in New York, and I titled it "Serious Nonsense."
So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead.
I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side, I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid.
I copied it and I never unlearned it -- it's the only style I know.
And it's very kind of staid and formal.
And meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see.
This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors, and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor -- which you can't see there.
This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.
This is a home-built rocket-propelled car.
That's a 1953 Henry J -- I'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo.
This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film.
You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town.
My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it.
And I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism," which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.
And they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong.
And the peak time for that was the 30s, because the Depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ...
and technology was going to carry us along.
This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days -- I had a huge collection of them from the '30s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour -- it's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful.
Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.
I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter, so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject.
Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half.
This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.
This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.
That's from a whole catalog -- it's 18 pages or so -- ran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth.
Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened -- for good reason, usually.
The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based, obviously, on the Hindenburg.
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark, and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.
So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.
This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.
The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter, but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.
It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.
You needed to know that.
The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream.
My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car.
This is pitched into the future from 1946, looking at the day all American families have them.
"There's Moscow, Shirley.
Hope they speak Esperanto!"
Faux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of -- not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it.
It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion -- so I think that's a case for serious play.
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining, recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s, dining on the wing of a plane.
You can't see it very well here, but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away.
This is tank polo in the South Hamptons.
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody.
I do a lot of that.
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.
I think it adds a huge amount.
Those, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.
They had two machine guns and a cannon, and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.
And they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.
Happy little story, isn't it?
This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s, where you drove up to your front door, if you had the guts.
I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm.
And I love cigars -- there's a cigar billboard down there.
It's a fond memory of times past.
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit, just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again -- "RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."
The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages, says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over, and it's so safe it carries no insurance.
It's obviously modeled on the Titanic.
But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements.
It's just a sick, silly joke.
Shamelessly cheap is something, I think -- this will wake you up.
It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi, and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that, and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed.
I hope nobody knows it."
People wrote in for reprints of that thing.
Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.
I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.
I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m., and this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?"
And that -- who's to say?
The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it's a very somber place.
I thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it.
This is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.
I couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying, "This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed, please apologize on our website."
Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may.
This is the word side of my brain.
I love the word "Eurotrash."
That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs.
This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.
If you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move.
Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do -- and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France -- sign of our times, I guess.
This is the only fashion cover I've ever done.
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.
People always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover, in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down.
It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.
And then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet.
Her former name was Fay Wray, and so that was -- I didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting."
Finally, this was a three-page cover, never done before, and I don't think it will ever be done again -- successive pages in the front of the magazine.
It's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.
You can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough, you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.
Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke.
That completes my oeuvre.
I would just like to add a crass commercial -- I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches," a compendium of all the serious play that ever was, and it's going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores, tables on the street in October.
So thank you very much.
So magic is a very introverted field.
While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.
That's true even amongst peers.
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research, or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research?
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.
And about three years ago, I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster.
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.
It's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system, or a digital storytelling tool.
Could we bring down the lights please?
Thank you.
So let's give this a try.
And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life.
Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.
Wake up.
Hey.
Come on.
Please.
Come on.
Ah, sorry about that.
Forgot this.
Give it another try.
Okay.
He figured out the system.
Uh oh.
All right. Let's try this.
Come on.
Hey.
You heard her, go ahead.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
Slide into the shimmering surface between two worlds. And no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear. If I could be anywhere, if I could be anywhere, if I could be anywhere in history, I would want to be here. The Romans, the Spanish the British, the Dutch, American exceptionalism, so out of touch. The folly of empire repeating its course, imposing its will and ruling by force on and on through time. Thank you.
If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large, urban areas like New York City.
And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog: an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.
When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront, despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week.
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.
I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities that I'd mentioned earlier.
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me -- and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.
I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.
And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.
We garnered much support along the way.
And the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.
We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $3 million park.
And, in the fall, I'm actually going to -- I exchange marriage vows with my beloved.
Thank you very much.
That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.
But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coalmine.
We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.
Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.
Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities.
As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health.
I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility -- which I do.
These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?
Our 27 percent obesity rate is high, even for this country, and diabetes comes with it.
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma.
Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average.
These impacts are coming everyone's way.
And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential.
50 percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line.
25 percent of us are unemployed.
Low-income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care.
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.
Poor people are not only still poor; they are still unhealthy.
Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term.
None of us want that, and we all have that in common.
So what else do we have in common?
Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking -- -- graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned.
OK.
Good.
But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways.
I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.
Jesus.
I grew up with a crack house across the street.
Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.
These things make me different from you.
But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds, with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.
So how did things get so different for us?
In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later he married my mom.
At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.
My dad was not alone.
And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country.
Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment.
Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems.
In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign.
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.
600,000 people were displaced.
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.
And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that is bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you?
So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home and all we had.
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.
Now, why is this story important?
Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation.
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come.
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?
What costs are associated with these decisions?
And who pays?
Who profits?
Does anything justify what the local community goes through?
This was "planning" -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind.
Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.
That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the South Bronx.
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths.
Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.
They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development.
Think bike shops, juice stands.
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and as redesigned by Matthews-Nielsen landscape architects.
And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.
Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.
As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.
We run a project called the Bronx Ecological Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restorations, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs.
Little by little, we're seeding the area with green collar jobs -- then the people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment.
The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.
Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway.
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.
We also built the city's -- New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.
Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.
Green roofs are soil and living plants.
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe.
Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine.
And they provide habitats for our little friends!
So -- -- so cool!
Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.
I like that, too.
Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: we need investors.
End of pitch.
Anyway -- OK. Katrina.
Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common.
Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another.
In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.
We're at best ignored and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability.
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out.
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight.
Or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone.
Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two like the South Bronx did?
Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?
Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral.
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through, like a tiny little bit.
You've no clue.
But I'll tell you later if you want to know.
But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end.
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line" that sustainable development can produce.
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.
At present, that's not happening in New York City.
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit.
A parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space.
And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny.
Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks.
Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit.
Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.
Now let's get this straight.
I am not anti-development.
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist.
You probably all have it, and if you haven't, you need to.
So I don't have a problem with developers making money.
There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune.
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that.
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit.
This is my version of globalization.
Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking: a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.
However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Penalosa.
He looked at the demographics.
Few Bogatanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world.
For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached.
But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened.
People stopped littering; crime rates dropped -- because the streets were alive with people.
His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget at that.
We have no excuse in this country.
I'm sorry.
But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather to provide opportunities for all Bogatanos to participate in the city's resurgence.
That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the US.
But Bogota's example has the power to change that.
You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence.
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.
Use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere.
Don't just talk about it at TED.
This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal.
Help me make green the new black.
Help me make sustainability sexy.
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations.
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice.
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return.
Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.
Oh good, glad I have a little more time!
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy.
His response was a grant program.
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.
I was making him an offer.
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around.
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.
But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process.
Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.
I have come from so far to meet you like this.
Please don't waste me.
By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world.
We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing: we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
Ciao bellos!
So it was about four years ago, five years ago, I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was, with a bag similar to this.
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well, but your body knows it extremely well.
And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time, because we are very immune to this.
This is called alpha-gal epitope.
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.
Actually our body doesn't hate these.
Our body loves these. It eats them.
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.
And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell, it means "that's food."
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.
But I said we can't get rid of it, because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity.
And I said, why don't you use that?
What if I could stick this molecule, slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?
I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there, where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you, like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A., and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car, and then charges you for possession of marijuana.
It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.
So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street.
And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.
Our antibiotics are running out.
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.
So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won't be here.
But if we are -- we're going to need something to do with the bacteria.
So I started working with this thing, with a bunch of collaborators.
And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones, bacteria that we don't like.
And I feel now like George Bush.
It's like "mission accomplished."
So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.
This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there, sort of symbolizing this right now.
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body, and will alert your immune system to go after it.
Here's what happened.
See that line on the very top with the little dots?
That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas, at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular, and direct your immune system to it.
You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line -- that's a 100 percent survival rate.
And they actually lived another 14 days, or 28 when we finally killed them, and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.
Why did they not die?
And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.
So we did it.
Okay?
Mission accomplished!
I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960.
This box contains one billion people.
And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people.
In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people.
And they lived away then.
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world.
In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families.
And their aspiration was to buy a car.
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this.
This was the economic level at which Sweden was.
But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day.
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes.
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up.
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about "the West" and "the Developing World."
But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.
And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population.
Just look how many.
The world population has doubled since I went to school.
And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here.
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly.
So this is where they are today.
And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them.
They are now buying cars.
And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world.
So there they are.
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago.
The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have.
And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.
But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap.
But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever.
But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.
This is the new world we have today in 2010.
And what will happen in the future?
Well, I'm going to project into 2050.
I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did.
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent.
[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.
They will start flying.
And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically.
And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here.
And they will start to buy electric cars.
This is what we will find there.
So what about the poorest two billion?
What about the poorest two billion here?
Will they move on?
Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end.
Here [among the poorest], population is growing.
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion.
There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening.
Because we already have this [growth] in process.
But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050.
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth.
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology.
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles.
Every bubble is a country.
The size is population.
The colors show the continent.
The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia.
That's India and this is China.
Size is population.
Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families.
The year is 1960.
And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.
But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival.
What has happened?
Here we go.
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?
They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning.
Family size is decreasing.
[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families].
Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.
The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion.
Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here?
They are still up here.
And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation.
And the population will double in one generation.
So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent.
That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world.
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.
Child survival is the new green.
It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth.
And will it happen?
Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist.
I'm a very serious "possibilist."
It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world.
It can be done.
We can have a much more just world.
With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty, and global governance, the world can become like this.
And look at the position of the old West.
Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life.
This will not happen [again].
The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less.
But it's a very important role.
Do it well and get used to it.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.
I would love to share with you a story.
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.
Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling.
It was venerable.
It was ubiquitous.
But it was a little bit boring.
Because in its 400 years of existence, storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device.
But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever.
His name was Lothar, Lothar Meggendorfer.
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, and he said, "Genug ist genug!"
He grabbed his pen, he snatched his scissors.
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold.
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book.
For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced.
They were happy because the story survived, and that the world would keep on spinning.
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last.
Whether storytellers realized it or not, they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville, radio news to radio theater, film to film in motion to film in sound, color, 3D, on VHS and on DVD.
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.
Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.
For example, one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine.
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D.
And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.
And after all this, everyone paused; they took a step back.
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling, they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.
And this was a cause for celebration.
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure, consistent novelty.
And they remembered a man, one amazing German, every time a new storytelling device popped up next.
And for that, the audience -- the lovely, beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after.
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future.
He had a vision. When he got out, he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight, and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.
He'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.
It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside, but when they talked about what they did, they talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton: promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user, focus-grouping new product launches, territorial expansion.
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.
It's a lot harder than you might think.
Contrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life when you're in prison.
You've got to pay for your own life.
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.
And it's hard for a couple of reasons.
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you'd pay on the street, and second, you don't make a lot of money.
I unloaded trucks.
That was my full-time job, unloading trucks at a food warehouse, for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.
So how do you survive?
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.
There's legal hustles.
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be.
You want a cigarette in prison?
Three to five dollars.
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head?
Three hundred bucks.
You want a dirty magazine?
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.
So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity.
Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse, sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers, or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less, and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training businesses.
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even.
And then, when they come out, most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background.
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years.
Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.
But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons, because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.
All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.
Thank you.
How many of you have checked your email today?
Come on, raise your hands.
How many of you are checking it right now?
And how about finances?
Anybody check that today?
Credit card, investment account?
How about this week?
Now, how about your household energy use?
Anybody check that today?
This week?
Last week?
A few energy geeks spread out across the room.
It's good to see you guys.
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet, and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change.
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet.
We met her on our first family vacation.
Harriet's paying attention to her energy use, and she is decidedly not an energy geek.
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention.
This is coal, the most common source of electricity on the planet, and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year.
But unfortunately, between here and here, most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat.
In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.
So this coal will last a little bit more than a month.
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year, you'd need this much coal.
The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use, we waste nine.
That means there's good news, because for every unit of energy we save, we save the other nine.
So the question is, how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we're using, and start wasting less of it?
The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer, 10 years ago, and only 90 miles from here, in San Marcos, California.
Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood, asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans.
One quarter of the homes received a message that said, did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?
Turn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.
Another group got an environmental message.
And still a third group got a message about being good citizens, preventing blackouts.
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.
In fact, none of these messages worked.
They had zero impact on energy consumption.
It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all.
But there was a fourth message, and this message simply said, "When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.
Please join them.
Turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans."
The people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing.
So what does this tell us?
Well, if something is inconvenient, even if we believe in it, moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us -- but social pressure, that's powerful stuff.
And harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.
In fact, it already is.
Inspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I started a company called Opower.
We built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy.
We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.
Just like those effective door hangers, we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors, and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save.
We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application, web, and now even a controllable thermostat, and for the last five years we've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world.
And it's working.
Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills, and we're just getting started.
This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities in six countries, we're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings.
Now, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours, but for the rest of us, two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined for more than a year.
Two terawatt hours, it's roughly half what the U.S. solar industry produced last year.
And two terawatt hours? In terms of coal, we'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity.
We're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior.
But we're just one company, and this is just scratching the surface.
Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted, and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs.
They may.
I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms, and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.
That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change.
That's 40 billion -- with a B -- every year in the U.S. alone.
That's half our coal usage right there.
Now thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these, and this is both fantastic and essential.
It's you, and it's me.
And we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science.
We can do it today, we know it works, and it will save us money right away.
So what are we waiting for?
Well, in most places, utility regulation hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy.
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.
But this story is much more than about household energy use.
Take a look at the Prius.
It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science.
The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy they're saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers.
Which brings us back to Harriet.
We met her on our first family vacation.
She came over to meet my young daughter, and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name is also Harriet.
She asked me what I did for a living, and I told her, I work with utilities to help people save energy.
It was then that her eyes lit up.
She looked at me, and she said, "You're exactly the person I need to talk to.
You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility.
It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors."
"And for the last two weeks, all we can think about, talk about, and even argue about, is what we should be doing to save energy.
We did everything that letter told us to do, and still I know there must be more.
Now I'm here with a genuine expert.
Tell me.
What should I do to save energy?"
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.
My goal is to make sure we are all asking it.
Thank you.

Miwa Matreyek!
I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement, to resonate other people's feelings, thoughts, intentions, motivations, in the act of being with them.
As a scientist, I always wanted to measure that resonance, that sense of the other that happens so quickly, in the blink of an eye.
We intuit other people's feelings.
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen.
We're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity.
We do that all the time. We just can't shake it off.
It's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves, to understand the world around them, is shaped by that stance.
We are social to the core.
So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism.
Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long-stay hospitals. This is a long time ago.
And for them, autism was devastating.
They had profound intellectual disabilities.
They didn't talk. But most of all, they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them, from their environment and from the people.
In fact, at the time, if you walked into a school for individuals with autism, you'd hear a lot of noise, plenty of commotion, actions, people doing things, but they're always doing things by themselves.
So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling, or they may be isolated in the corner, or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements, in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere.
Extremely, extremely isolated.
Well, now we know that autism is this disruption, the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you.
These are survival skills.
These are survival skills that we inherited over many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.
You see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility.
Without the caregiver, they wouldn't survive, so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival.
They orient to the caregiver.
From the first days and weeks of life, babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment.
They prefer to look at people rather than at things, and even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes, because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences, so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away.
Well, they orient to the caregiver.
The caregiver seeks the baby.
And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind, the social mind, the social brain, depends on.
We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life.
It doesn't. It begins with the beginning of life.
As babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well, there is something in between the ears that is very important -- it's invisible, you can't see -- but is really critical, and that thing is called attention.
And they learn soon enough, even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want.
They also learn to follow other people's gaze, because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about.
And soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things, because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something, they're not just getting a directional cue, they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing, the attitude, and soon enough they start building this body of meanings, but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction.
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others.
Well, this is a little 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism.
And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me.
Imagine if I did that to you, and I came two inches from your face.
You'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?
You would recoil. You would call the police.
You would do something, because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get a reaction.
We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly.
This is our body wisdom. It's not something that is mediated by our language. Our body just knows that, and we've known that for a long time.
And this is not something that happens to humans only.
It happens to some of our phylatic cousins, because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey, and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you, and that is considered to be a signal or threat, well, you are not going to be alive for long.
So something that in other species are survival mechanisms, without them they wouldn't basically live, we bring into the context of human beings, and this is what we need to simply act, act socially.
Now, she is oblivious to me, and I am so close to her, and you think, maybe she can see you, maybe she can hear you.
Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;M.
So I could not attract her attention, but something, a thing, did.
Now, most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people.
Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear, and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like.
Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences.
Now, what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further.
So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic, the brain determines who we are going to be.
But in fact the brain also becomes who we are, and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind and this is what's happening with her brain.
Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders, and it's a brain disorder.
It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born.
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled, but there are those that are gifted.
There are those individuals who don't talk at all.
There are those individuals who talk too much.
There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school, you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them, to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly, relentlessly, but often in an awkward fashion, without that immediate resonance.
Well, this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time.
When I started in this field, we thought that there were four individuals with autism per 10,000, a very rare condition.
Well, now we know it's more like one in 100.
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us.
The societal cost of this condition is huge.
In the U.S. alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars, and you know what? Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled, individuals who need wrap-around services, services that are very, very intensive, and those services can cost in excess of 60 to 80,000 dollars a year.
Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment, because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you.
Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point, and intervene and treat, I can tell you, and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years, this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition.
Also, we have a window of opportunity, because the brain is malleable for just so long, and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life.
It's not that that window closes. It doesn't.
But it diminishes considerably.
And yet, the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years, and in disadvantaged populations, the populations that don't have access to clinical services, rural populations, minorities, the age of diagnosis is later still, which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe.
So I feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative.
The science is there, but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community, and we just can't afford that missed opportunity, because children with autism become adults with autism, and we feel that those things that we can do for these children, for those families, early on, will have lifetime consequences, for the child, for the family, and for the community at large.
So this is our view of autism.
There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism. In fact, we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism, and genetic anomalies, much more than just genes.
And we actually have a bit of a question here, because if there are so many different causes of autism, how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome?
Because people like myself, when we walk into a playroom, we recognize a child as having autism.
So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?
And the answer is, what lies in between, which is development.
And in fact, we are very interested in those first two years of life, because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism.
Autism creates itself.
Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life, we might attenuate for some, and God knows, maybe even prevent for others.
So how do we do that?
How do we enter that feeling of resonance, how do we enter another person's being?
I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-older, that the thing that came to mind was, "How do you come into her world?
Is she thinking about me?
Is she thinking about others?"
Well, it's hard to do that, so we had to create the technologies. We had to basically step inside a body.
We had to see the world through her eyes.
And so in the past many years we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking.
We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with.
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare.
What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory, but in order for us to do that, we had to create these very sophisticated measures, measures of how people, how little babies, how newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment, what is important, and what is not.
Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention.
You're watching a video.
Those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds, and we freeze one frame, and this is what the typical children are doing.
In this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism.
So on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this, the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl.
What are the children with autism doing?
They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting.
Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment.
It happens moment by moment in their real lives, and their minds are being formed, and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers.
Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts.
You know, when you take a child to the pediatrician, and so you have physical height, and weight.
Well we decided that we're going to create growth charts of social engagement, and we sought children from the time that they are born, and what you see here on the x-axis is two, three, four, five, six months and nine, until about the age of 24 months, and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people's eyes, and this is their growth chart.
They start over here, they love people's eyes, and it remains quite stable.
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.
Now, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic.
It's something very different.
It starts way up here, but then it's a free fall.
It's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people, but it has no traction.
It's almost as if that stimulus, you, you're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives.
Now, we thought that those data were so powerful in a way, that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life, because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-older, you'd be surprised by how social those babies are.
And what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily.
And using these kinds of measures, and many others, what we found out is that our science could, in fact, identify this condition early on.
We didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life.
If we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved, and developmentally very early emerging, things that are online from the first weeks of life, we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months, and that's what we are doing now.
Now, we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children, but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community.
Now we want those devices, of course, to be deployed by those who are in the trenches, our colleagues, the primary care physicians, who see every child, and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice, because they have to see so many children.
And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child, but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment.
We need to be able to work with the families, to support the families, to manage those first years with them. We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment, because those treatments are going to change these children's and those families' lives.
Now, when we think about what we [can] do in those first years, I can tell you, having been in this field for so long, one feels really rejuvenated.
There is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities, preventing, in fact, those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field.
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition.
No longer.
We can do a great deal of things.
And the idea is not to cure autism.
That's not the idea.
What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times, the profound intellectual disabilities, the lack of language, the profound, profound isolation.
We feel that individuals with autism, in fact, have a very special perspective on the world, and we need diversity, and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength: predictable situations, situations that can be defined.
Because after all, they learn about the world almost like about it, rather than learning how to function in it.
But this is a strength, if you're working, for example, in technology.
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities.
We want them to be free of that.
We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise.
Well thank you for listening to me.
So here's the good news about families.
The last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family.
We have blended families, adopted families, we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house.
But through it all, the family has grown stronger.
Eight in 10 say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.
Now, here's the bad news.
Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life.
Every parent I know, myself included, feels like we're constantly playing defense.
Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath, they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.
And here's the worst news of all.
Our children sense we're out of control.
Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute asked 1,000 children, "If you were granted one wish about your parents, what would it be?"
The parents predicted the kids would say, spending more time with them.
They were wrong.
The kids' number one wish?
That their parents be less tired and less stressed.
So how can we change this dynamic?
Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress, draw our family closer, and generally prepare our children to enter the world?
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question, traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars, experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right and what can I learn from them to make my family happier?
I want to tell you about one family that I met, and why I think they offer clues.
At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho, where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.
The Starrs are a regular American family with their share of regular American family problems.
David is a software engineer.
Eleanor takes care of their four children, ages 10 to 15.
One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.
One has Asperger syndrome.
One has ADHD.
"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.
What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.
Instead of turning to friends or relatives, they looked to David's workplace.
They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan to startups in Silicon Valley.
In agile, workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time.
So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations, the team in effect manages itself.
You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.
You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.
David said when they brought this system into their home, the family meetings in particular increased communication, decreased stress, and made everybody happier to be part of the family team.
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters, it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.
And these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes.
So what is Agile, and why can it help with something that seems so different, like families?
In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England.
He was very frustrated with how software got designed.
Companies followed the waterfall method, right, in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below, and no one had ever consulted the programmers.
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.
They were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done.
Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time.
He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review before stumbling upon an article in 1986 called "The New New Product Development Game."
It said that the pace of business was quickening -- and by the way, this was in 1986 -- and the most successful companies were flexible.
It highlighted Toyota and Canon and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.
As Sutherland told me, we got to that article, and said, "That's it."
In Sutherland's system, companies don't use large, massive projects that take two years.
They do things in small chunks.
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network," you say, "You go off and come up with one element, then bring it back.
Let's talk about it.
Let's adapt."
You succeed or fail quickly.
Today, agile is used in a hundred countries, and it's sweeping into management suites.
Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families.
You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving, where you had one group of people working on the food, one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.
So let's take one problem that families face, crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.
A key plank is accountability, so teams use information radiators, these large boards in which everybody is accountable.
So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home, created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores.
So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs, poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair, and she sat there, kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs, checked the list, made themselves breakfast, checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher, rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had, checked the list once more, gathered their belongings, and made their way to the bus.
It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.
And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house, our kids needed way too much monitoring, Eleanor looked at me.
"That's what I thought," she said.
"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'
But I was wrong."
So I turned to David: "So why does it work?"
He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."
And he made a checkmark.
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.
With kids, it's heaven."
The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house, it cut parental screaming in half.
But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.
So following the agile model, we ask three questions: What worked well in our family this week, what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?
Everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on.
And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.
What worked well this week?
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.
What didn't work well?
Our math sheets, or greeting visitors at the door.
Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.
Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out, I mean at least not that are revealing.
This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.
But the most surprising part was when we turned to, what are we going to work on in the week ahead?
You know, the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves, and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.
Our kids love this process.
So they would come up with all these ideas.
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week, get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.
We constantly have to kind of dial them back.
Now look, naturally there's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week, but the truth is it didn't really bother us.
It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.
Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now -- We're still holding these meetings.
My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.
So what did we learn?
The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001 when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.
I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.
I'm proposing three planks.
Plank number one: Adapt all the time.
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?
We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.
That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.
We can't.
What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.
It's like they say in the Internet world: if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago, you're doing the wrong thing.
Parents can learn a lot from that.
But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.
We have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus or other family experts.
The truth is, their ideas are stale, whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively.
Let's just take a few examples.
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.
Everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids.
But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.
I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said, "No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?
We'll have family breakfast.
We'll meet for a bedtime snack.
We'll make Sunday meals more important."
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.
It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal.
The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."
You can take that 10 minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit.
So time-shift family dinner.
That's adaptability.
An environmental psychologist told me, "If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface, you'll be more rigid.
If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."
She told me, "When you're discipling your children, sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.
The conversation will go better."
My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because I was sitting above in the power position.
So move where you sit.
That's adaptability.
The point is there are all these new ideas out there.
We've got to hook them up with parents.
So plank number one: Adapt all the time.
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.
Plank number two: Empower your children.
Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.
There's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family.
But the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.
Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting, and we had voted to work on overreacting.
So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment.
Okay?"
So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.
So we kind of liked that.
But then her sister started working the system.
She said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"
I loved that.
Spend the time however you want.
Now give us a punishment.
Okay.
If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.
Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.
So you see, this is working.
Now look, this system isn't lax.
There's plenty of parental authority going on.
But we're giving them practice becoming independent, which of course is our ultimate goal.
Just as I was leaving to come here tonight, one of my daughters started screaming.
The other one said, "Overreaction!
Overreaction!"
and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.
To me that is a certified agile miracle.
And by the way, research backs this up too.
Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules, evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives.
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms, and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.
I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker, and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance.
And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"
He said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary or a $6 million inheritance."
So the bottom line is, empower your children.
Plank number three: Tell your story.
Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great," told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common: they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.
So agile is great for stimulating progress, but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.
So how do you do that?
Collins coached us on doing something that businesses do, which is define your mission and identify your core values.
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.
We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.
We had a pajama party.
I made popcorn.
Actually, I burned one, so I made two.
My wife bought a flip chart.
And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?
What values do we most uphold?
And we ended up with 10 statements.
We are travelers, not tourists.
We don't like dilemmas.
We like solutions.
Again, research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing on what they do right, worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.
This family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right.
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.
And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?
And we didn't really know what to do, so we called her into my office.
The family mission statement was on the wall, and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"
And she kind of looked down the list, and she said, "Bring people together?"
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.
Another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from.
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple "what do you know" test.
Do you know where your grandparents were born?
Do you know where your parents went to high school?
Do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.
The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness.
As the author of the study told me, children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence.
So my final plank is, tell your story.
Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones.
If you give children this happy narrative, you give them the tools to make themselves happier.
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina" and its famous opening sentence, "All happy families are alike.
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.
Of course all happy families aren't alike."
But as I began working on this project, I began changing my mind.
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time, to identify the building blocks that successful families have.
I've mentioned just three here today: Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.
Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?
The answer, I believe, is yes.
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old, his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick, which he had hidden in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.
That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned: Happiness is not something we find, it's something we make.
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion.
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.
It's a matter of choice.
You don't need some grand plan.
You don't need a waterfall.
You just need to take small steps, accumulate small wins, keep reaching for that green stick.
In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.
What's the secret to a happy family?
Try.
Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years.
We've questioned the future of capitalism.
We've questioned the financial industry.
We've looked at our government oversight.
We've questioned where we're going.
And yet, at the same time, this very well may be a seminal moment in American history, an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America.
I'm calling this The Great Unwind.
And the idea is a simple, simple idea, which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action.
Consumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America have actually started, just like banks and just like businesses, to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage, in daily life, to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward.
So, to understand this -- and I'm going to stress this -- it's not about the consumer being in retreat.
The consumer is empowered.
In order to understand this, we're going to step back and look a little bit at what's happened over the course of the last year and a half.
So, if you've been gone, this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy.
Okay?
Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down.
Commodity prices are like this.
If you're a mom trying to manage a budget, and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer, and it's somewhere between 50 and 70, do you plan vacations?
How do you buy?
What is your strategy in your household?
Will the bailout work?
We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, healthcare, all these issues facing us.
You put them all together, you mix them up in a bouillabaisse, and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time-bomb.
In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis, because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives, actually contributed a large part to the problem.
This is something I call the 50-20 paradox.
It took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent.
50 years.
Do you know what this was right here?
This was World War II.
Do you know why savings was so high?
There was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets.
Right?
So, what happened though, over the course of the last 20 years -- we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate.
Because we binged. We bought extra-large cars, supersized everything, we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome.
All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today.
The personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 percent to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years.
It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009.
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education, future children in our households.
So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout, what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills, first of all, 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.
But if you stack it up, you just see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out.
So this is the first 315 billion.
But I read this fact the other day, that one trillion seconds equals 32 thousand years, so if you think about that, the context, the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here, and trillion there, we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.
However, consumers have moved.
They are taking responsibility.
What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate.
In fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis.
We are working our way back up to that 10 percent.
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter, spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years, almost a 3.7 percent decline.
Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they're using credit cards.
So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have.
And we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest.
But that's not really the whole story.
Because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation.
And you've got to admit, over the course of the last year and a half, consumers have been doing some pretty weird things.
It's been pretty staggering, what we've lived through.
If you take into account 80 percent of all Americans were born after World War II, this is essentially our Depression.
And so, as a result, some crazy things have happened.
I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks.
Okay?
Dentists report molars, you know, people grinding their teeth, coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress.
And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.
Guns, gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January.
Vasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell institute.
And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003.
Does anybody know why?
No one is at the beach.
So there is a bright side to everything.
But seriously, what we see happening, and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat, is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out.
And what I mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption.
Right?
If you think about the last three decades, the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s, to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade, but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate.
By restricting their demand, consumers can actually align their values with their spending, and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more, but be about better.
We're going to explain that right now.
Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator, proprietary tool of VML and Young &amp; Rubicam, we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace.
We found a couple of really interesting things.
We're going to go through four value-shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors, that offer new management principles.
The first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life.
This is the movement from Americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity, because the less excess that you have around you, the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.
Déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.
The management principle is dollars and cents.
So let's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption that falls out of this value.
First things is we see something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.
But seriously, we also have this phenomenon on Madison Avenue and in other places, where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary, sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases.
We see high-end haggling in fashion today.
High-end haggling for luxury and real estate.
We also see just a relaxing of ego, and sort of a dismantling of artifice.
This is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar.
Blue-collar yacht club, where you can join the yacht club, but you've got to work in the boat yard, as sort of condition of membership.
We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low key. Right?
Agritourism, going to vineyards and going to farms.
And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents.
What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting.
A couple things that are kind of cool.
One is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer.
They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month, less at the end of the month. So what they did is they started to change their packaging.
Larger packs at the beginning of the month, smaller packaging at the end of the month.
Really interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants.
They've just instituted dynamic pricing.
So it takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups, to the weather, to the team records, in setting prices for the consumer.
Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga.
Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed-cost.
Again, this theme is about variable cost, variable living.
So micropayments have become huge.
And lastly, some people are using Hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill.
So, really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand.
The second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play.
We see that play itself out with empathy and respect.
The consumer is demanding it.
And, as a result, businesses must provide not only value, but values.
Increasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company, looking for their conduct in the marketplace.
So, what we see with empathy and respect, lots of really hopeful things that have come out of this recession.
And I'll give you a few examples.
One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods, and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system.
Also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing, which has been unemployment, is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country.
We also see the phenomenon -- some of you may have "boomerang kids" -- these are "boomerang alumni," where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining.
We also talked about character and professionalism.
We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City, you know, in January, and suddenly Sully has become a key name on Babycenter.
So, from a value and values standpoint, what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.
Microsoft is doing something wonderful.
They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with I.T. training, using their existing infrastructure to do something good.
Also a really interesting company is Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees, to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses.
But they also talk about the fact that their executives, all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see.
Think twice before you have that bottle of wine.
The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living.
We're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon, not a sprint.
Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before, 9.4 years on average, in March. A record.
We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America.
Did you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card?
The highest percentage ever in our nation's history.
So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge.
Continuing education is up.
Everything is focused on betterment, and training, and development and moving forward.
We also see a big DIY movement.
I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners.
That includes cottages and the like. But 30 percent.
So, people are getting their hands dirty. They are rolling up their sleeves.
They want these skills.
We see that with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens and chickens and ducks. And when you work out the math, they say it doesn't work, but the principle is there that it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself.
And then we look at the High Line in New York City, an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good, which is a brand new park in New York City.
So, what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers, be a brand that lasts, offer transparency, promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale.
Perfect example of that is Patagonia.
Patagonia's Footprint Chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make, and gives you social responsibility, and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make.
Another great example is Fidelity.
Rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases, this is about 529 rewards for your student education.
Or the interesting company SunRun.
I love this company. They've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility, where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace.
So, it's a consumer driven co-op.
So, the fourth sort of post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold.
It's incredibly important right now.
Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.
It's now about connecting to your communities, connecting to your social networks.
In my book I talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company, versus 15 percent on advertising.
So, in that respect, cooperative consumerism has really taken off.
This is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace.
Let's look at a couple of quick examples.
The artisanal movement is huge.
Everything about locally derived products and services, supporting your local neighborhoods, whether it's cheeses, wines and other products.
Also this rise of local currencies.
Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment, you're doing business with people you trust, in your local markets.
So, this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon.
And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating.
They actually started, in certain communities in the United States, start to publish people's electricity usage.
And what they found out is when that was available for public record, the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.
Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling, which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled.
And then there is this other really interesting movement that's happened in California, which is about carrot mobs.
The traditional thing would be to boycott right?
Have a stick?
Well why not have a carrot?
So these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good.
And then we look at what companies can do.
This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer.
You have to realize that you can't fight and control this.
You actually need to organize it.
You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning.
And there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see.
First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants, into actually rating healthcare.
So what credentials does Zagat's have?
Well, they have a lot, because it's their network of people. Right?
So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic.
Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.
This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck. Right?
It's a moving truck through L.A., and the only way you can find it is through Twitter.
Or you look at Johnson &amp; Johnson's Momversations.
Where J&amp;J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers, allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect.
And it's also become a very, very valuable sort of advertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.
So, when we look at this and we step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real.
It's been tremendously powerful for consumers.
But, at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity.
And the Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin.
Crisis equals opportunity.
What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession.
So, we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better.
It will drive innovation.
It will make longer-lasting products.
It will create better, more intuitive customer service.
It will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share.
So, when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data, we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.
Thank you very much.
Of the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most, and it's the one that I can least take for granted.
I think this is partially due to my father, who was blind.
It was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about, usually.
One time in Nova Scotia, when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun -- yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song, which may or may not refer to James Taylor, Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.
They handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes.
But Dad got really scared: he didn't want us doing that.
He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged.
I thought this was a little strange at the time.
What I didn't know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight.
When he and his sister Martha were just very little, their mom took them out to see a total eclipse -- or actually, a solar eclipse -- and not long after that, both of them started losing their eyesight.
Decades later, it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection.
As near as we can tell, it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse, but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault.
So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946, married my mom, and bought a house in Lexington, Massachusetts, where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775, although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord.
He got a job working for Raytheon, designing guidance systems, which was part of the Route 128 high-tech axis in those days -- so the equivalent of Silicone Valley in the '70s.
Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy; he just really felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap, although they did let him get through the several-hour-long army physical exam before they got to the very last test, which was for vision.
So, Dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius, rocket scientist, inventor.
But to us he was just Dad, and our home life was pretty normal.
As a kid, I watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics.
I played a lot of chess.
But at the age of 14, a friend of mine got me interested in comic books, and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living.
So, here's my dad: he's a scientist, he's an engineer and he's a military contractor.
So, he has four kids, right?
One grows up to become a computer scientist, one grows up to join the Navy, one grows up to become an engineer, and then there's me: the comic book artist.
Which, incidentally, makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen, because I'm a comic book artist, son of an inventor, and he's an inventor, son of a comic book artist.
Right, it's true.
The funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me.
He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist, even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever: everything he saw was just a blur.
Now, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith," which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people.
Now, faith in things which cannot be seen, which cannot be proved, is not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much.
I tend to like science, where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know.
But there's a middle ground, too.
A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage, and his steam-driven computers that were never built.
Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind, except for Ada Lovelace, and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream.
Vannevar Bush with his Memex -- this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips -- he had this vision.
And I think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook.
And, yeah, we can look back in retrospect and say, yeah, ha-ha, you know -- it's all microfilm.
But that's -- that's not the point.
He understood the shape of the future.
So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction.
Same thing: he understood the shape of the future, even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later.
Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.
Or even the people who actually pulled it off, the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston, who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network, and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's -- on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts, just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips singing "Midnight Train to Georgia," while -- -- in my dad's big easy chair, you know?
So, three types of vision, right?
Vision based on what one cannot see: the vision of that unseen and unknowable.
The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained.
And this third kind of vision, of something which can be, which may be, based on knowledge, but is as yet unproven.
Now, we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science, but I think it's also true in the arts, it's true in politics, it's even true in personal endeavors.
What it comes down to, really, is four basic principles: learn from everyone, follow no one, watch for patterns, and work like hell.
I think these are the four principles that go into this.
And it's that third one, especially, where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves.
What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world, is, I think, only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor.
In comics, I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works.
Then there's another, more classical, attitude which embraces beauty and craft.
Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content.
And then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience -- and honesty, and rawness.
These are four very different ways of looking at the world.
I even gave them names.
The classicist, the animist, and formalist and iconoclast.
Interestingly, it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung's four subdivisions of human thought.
And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right; tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.
And if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth.
And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art, which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all, or for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme of "Inspired by Nature" -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him, but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die, but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says, "Because it's my nature" -- in that sense, yes.
So -- so this was my nature.
The thing was, I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was, I saw it as just this road to discovery.
Actually, it was just me embracing my nature, which means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all.
So what does a "scientific mind" do in the arts?
Well, I started making comics, but I also started trying to understand them, almost immediately.
And one of the most important things about comics, I discovered, was that comics are a visual medium, but they try to embrace all of the senses within it.
So, the different elements of comics, like pictures and words, and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision.
So you have things like resemblance, where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions: abstracted from resemblance, but still retaining the complete meaning, or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan.
Put all these three together, and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace.
And if you move to the right you also get language, because that's abstracting even further from resemblance, but still maintaining meaning.
Vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage, as well.
Also, to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals.
And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics.
Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels, and then gives you something to imagine between the panels.
Also, another sense which comics' vision represents, and that's time.
Sequence is a very important aspect of comics.
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.
And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics, but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms, and I found some in history.
And you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea.
What's happening is, the art form is colliding with the given technology, whether it's paint on stone, like the Tomb of the Scribe in ancient Egypt, or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column, or a 200-foot-long embroidery, or painted deerskin and tree bark running across 88 accordion-folded pages.
What's interesting is, once you hit print -- and this is from 1450, by the way -- all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves: rectilinear panel arrangements, simple line drawings without tone and a left-to-right reading sequence.
And within 100 years, you already start to see word balloons and captions, and it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here.
So I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book, I had to do a little bit of typesetting, and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it, so I bought a computer.
And it was just a little thing -- it wasn't good for much except text entry -- but my father had told me about Moore's Law, about Moore's Law back in the '70s, and I knew what was coming.
And so, I kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre-print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond, to post-print comics.
So, one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound, motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs that were being made in those days.
This was even before the Web.
And one of the first things they did was, they tried to take the comics page as-is and transplant it to monitors, which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology.
And so, what they would do is, they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages, and they would introduce all this sound and motion.
The problem was, that if you go with this idea -- this basic idea that space equals time in comics -- what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion, which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time, then they break with that continuity of presentation.
Interactivity was another thing.
There were hypertext comics.
But the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here, not here or connected to here; it's profoundly non-spatial.
The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny, the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to "Plan 9" to nine lives: it's all the same.
And -- but in comics, in comics, every aspect of the work, every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.
So the question was: was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us?
And I found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that I was showing you.
Each of them has a single unbroken reading line, whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right, or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages.
The same thing is happening, and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise, but there were compromises when print hit.
Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments, so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again.
And I thought, O.K., well, if that's true, is there any way, when we go beyond today's print, to somehow bring that back?
Now, the monitor is just as limited as the page, technically, right?
It's a different shape, but other than that it's the same basic limitation.
But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page, but not if you look at the monitor as a window.
And that's what I proposed: that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas: along the X axis and the Y axis and staircases.
We could do circular narratives that were literally circular.
We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn.
Parallel narratives could be literally parallel.
X, Y and also Z.
So I had all these notions. This was back in the late '90s, and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy, but a lot of people then went on and actually did it.
I'm going to show you a couple now.
This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex.
And notice what's going on here.
What I'm searching for is a durable mutation -- that's what all of us are searching for.
As media head into this new era, we are looking for mutations that are durable, that have some sort of staying power.
Now, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium, and then we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end.
That's that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now.
But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time, that's just where the technology is right now.
As the technology evolves, as you get full immersive displays and whatnot, this sort of thing will only grow.
It will adapt.
It will adapt to its environment: it's a durable mutation.
Here's another one I'll show you. This is by Drew Weing; this is called, "Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe."
See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.
We'll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea.
I just want to get to the last panel.
There we go.
Just one more.
Talk about your infinite canvas.
It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain.
Why is this important?
I think this is important because media, all media, provide us a window back into our world.
Now, it could be that motion pictures -- and eventually, virtual reality, or something equivalent to it -- some sort of immersive display, is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in.
That's why most people turn to storytelling, is to escape.
But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in.
And when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique.
Because what you're looking at is, you're looking at comics cubed: you're looking at comics that are more comics-like than they've ever been before.
When that happens, you provide people with multiple ways of re-entering the world through different windows, and when you do that, it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape.
One of many reasons, but I've got to go now.
Thank you for having me.
So, basically we have public leaders, public officials who are out of control; they are writing bills that are unintelligible, and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity, which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.
If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits; if you're trying to get a small business loan, you face a blizzard of paperwork.
What are we going to do about it?
I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity, transparency and empathy, building humanity into communications.
I've been simplifying things for 30 years.
I come out of the advertising and design business.
My focus is understanding you people, and how you interact with the government to get your benefits, how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with, and how you view brands.
So, very quickly, when President Obama said, "I don't see why we can't have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."
So, I locked myself in a room, figured out the content, organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.
I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country.
This is a real thing.
Now, I went one step further and said, "Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document?
Let's go online."
And many people might need help in computation.
Working with the Harvard Business School, you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment: If you spent 62 dollars for a meal, the longer you take to pay out that loan, you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.
How about that?
Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?
But it's going to work.
It's more effective than just computational aids.
And what about terms like "over the limit"?
Perhaps a stealth thing.
Define it in context. Tell people what it means.
When you put it in plain English, you almost force the institution to give the people a way, a default out of that, and not put themselves at risk.
Plain English is about changing the content.
And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM.
It's a grid, it's a calendar.
At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities, you have responsibilities.
Received very favorably by business.
And there is some good news to report today.
Each year, one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS.
There are 200 million letters that go out.
Running through this typical letter that they had, I ran it through my simplicity lab, it's pretty unintelligible.
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.
We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English.
They have been tested in the laboratory.
When I run it through my lab, this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible.
And the IRS has introduced the program.
There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention.
There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency, how to mandate simplicity.
We see all this complexity.
It's incumbent upon us, and this organization, I believe, to make clarity, transparency and empathy a national priority.
There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate.
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.
So, how are we going to change the world?
Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.
I thank you.
Well, Arthur C. Clarke, a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s, said that, "We overestimate technology in the short term, and we underestimate it in the long term."
And I think that's some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots.
That we're overestimating the technology in the short term.
But I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term.
Because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we, our society, is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future.
So I'm scared we won't have enough robots.
But fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time.
Back in 1957, there was a Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn movie.
So you know how it ended up, Spencer Tracy brought a computer, a mainframe computer of 1957, in to help the librarians.
The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives, "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"
And they would look that up.
And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job.
Well of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn't much use for that job.
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear.
But that's not what happened in fact.
The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957.
It wasn't until the Internet came into play, the web came into play and search engines came into play that the need for librarians went down.
And I think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today.
And we can just ask: "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"
and be told instantly -- or anything else we want to ask.
By the way, the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period, because librarians became partners of computers.
Computers became tools, and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time.
Same thing happened in offices.
Back in the old days, people used spreadsheets.
Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper, and they calculated by hand.
But here was an interesting thing that came along.
With the revolution around 1980 of P.C. 's, the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers, not to replace office workers, but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers.
So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets.
It increased their capabilities.
They no longer had to do the mundane computations, but they could do something much more.
Now today, we're starting to see robots in our lives.
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot.
When soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan, instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick, as they used to do up until about 2002, they now send the robot out.
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs.
On the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh.
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry.
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy.
And it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients.
In fact, robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.
But I think when it comes to factory robots, people are sort of afraid, because factory robots are dangerous to be around.
In order to program them, you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions.
And ordinary people can't interact with them.
And I think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong.
It's displaced the worker from the technology.
And I think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with.
And so I want to tell you today about Baxter, which we've been talking about.
And Baxter, I see, as a way -- a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting.
So Baxter is up here.
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics.
We've got a conveyor there.
And if the lighting isn't too extreme -- Ah, ah!
There it is.
It's picked up the object off the conveyor.
It's going to come bring it over here and put it down.
And then it'll go back, reach for another object.
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense.
By the way, what's going on with the eyes?
The eyes are on the screen there.
The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move.
So a person that's interacting with the robot understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions.
Here Chris took the object out of its hand, and Baxter didn't go and try to put it down; it went back and realized it had to get another one.
And Baxter's safe to interact with.
You wouldn't want to do this with a current industrial robot.
But with Baxter it doesn't hurt.
It feels the force, understands that Chris is there and doesn't push through him and hurt him.
But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface.
And so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now.
And when he grabs an arm, it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen.
You can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm.
He's going to put something in its hand, he's going to bring it over here, press a button and let go of that thing in the hand.
And the robot figures out, ah, he must mean I want to put stuff down.
It puts a little icon there.
He comes over here, and he gets the fingers to grasp together, and the robot infers, ah, you want an object for me to pick up.
That puts the green icon there.
He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.
It just moves it around, and the robot figures out that was an area search.
He didn't have to select that from a menu.
And now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking.
So as we continue here, I want to tell you about what this is like in factories.
These robots we're shipping every day.
They go to factories around the country.
This is Mildred.
Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.
She's worked on the line for over 20 years.
One hour after she saw her first industrial robot, she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory.
She decided she really liked robots.
And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand.
Now she's got the robot doing it.
When we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better, one of the questions we asked them was, "Do you want your children to work in a factory?"
The universal answer was "No, I want a better job than that for my children."
And as a result of that, Mildred is very typical of today's factory workers in the U.S.
They're older, and they're getting older and older.
There aren't many young people coming into factory work.
And as their tasks become more onerous on them, we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with, so that they can be part of the solution, so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S.
And so our vision is that Mildred who's the line worker becomes Mildred the robot trainer.
She lifts her game, like the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do.
We're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use.
They're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes.
There's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable.
That's climate change and demographics.
Demographics is really going to change our world.
This is the percentage of adults who are working age.
And it's gone down slightly over the last 40 years.
But over the next 40 years, it's going to change dramatically, even in China.
The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically.
And turned up the other way, the people who are retirement age goes up very, very fast, as the baby boomers get to retirement age.
That means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services.
But more than that, as we get older we get more frail and we can't do all the tasks we used to do.
If we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers, before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older.
That's happening statistically right now.
And as the number of people who are older, above retirement age and getting older, as they increase, there will be less people to take care of them.
And I think we're really going to have to have robots to help us.
And I don't mean robots in terms of companions.
I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older.
Getting the groceries in from the car, up the stairs, into the kitchen.
Or even, as we get very much older, driving our cars to go visit people.
And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution.
So they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them.
And so I really think that we're going to be spending more time with robots like Baxter and working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives. And that we will -- Here, Baxter, it's good.
And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years as part of our everyday lives.
Thanks very much.
When I was growing up in Montana, I had two dreams.
I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life.
I was very fortunate early in my career.
I was fortunate in finding things.
I wasn't very good at reading things.
In fact, I don't read much of anything.
I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do.
But instead, I go out and I find things.
Then I just pick things up.
I basically practice for finding money on the street.
And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things.
And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests, the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones.
And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years.
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.
And so, at that time, I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues.
We were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young, brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds.
So it was pretty interesting stuff.
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals.
In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults.
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults.
And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like.
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
And in his book, he talked about the social animals.
And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures.
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
You all know the story, right.
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."
If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out.
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it.
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.
And everybody's happy about that.
And they're happy over and over again.
Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire.
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.
So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos.
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
Now if you want dinosaur DNA, I say go to the dinosaur.
So that's what we've done.
Back in 1993 when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur, and we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.
And one of my former doctoral students, Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing.
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there.
They found these red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world, like red blood cells.
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.
And so she thought, well, what the heck.
So she sampled some material out of it.
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin.
And that was really cool.
That was interesting.
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project.
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them.
And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.
And we did find a lot of stuff.
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex.
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex.
And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16.
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet.
But this one died at the age of 16.
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone.
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant.
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But Mary went further.
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.
Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left.
But there was something left.
There were blood vessels left.
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
It was extraordinary.
But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones.
And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins.
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples.
And we did. We got better material.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast.
We're just not going to be able to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur.
But birds are dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
We actually classify them as dinosaurs.
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.
So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them.
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."
"You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."
"The chicken is not."
So this is our problem, as you can imagine.
The chicken is a dinosaur.
I mean it really is.
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
But the sixth-graders demand it.
"Fix the chicken."
So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken.
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken.
Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools.
We'll call them biological modification tools.
We have selection.
And we know selection works.
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese.
I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification.
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
That's how people make GloFish.
You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow.
And that's pretty cool.
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
I guess we could make a glow chicken.
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
But there's another thing.
There's what we call atavism activation.
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
And here's an example.
This is a chicken with teeth.
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens.
Now that's a good characteristic.
We can save that one.
We know we can use that.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
That's getting closer.
That's better than a glowing chicken.
A friend of mine, a colleague of mine, Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms.
And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop, and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.
He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing.
He's looking for those genes as well.
And I said, "Well, if you can find those, I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."
And so he agreed.
And so that's what we're looking into.
If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand.
But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing.
But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.
It has the three fingers, the three digits.
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, like the archaeopteryx.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail.
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus.
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
But it's just the very basics.
So that really is what we're doing.
And people always say, "Why do that?
Why make this thing?
What good is it?"
Well, that's a good question.
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things.
And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece.
Anyway -- When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design.
Thank you.
Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment.
Today's its debut.
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.
They are live and reacting to me in real time.
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.
So fingers crossed.
And keep your eyes on the big screen.
Augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer-generated imagery.
It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask, why, in a technological age, we continue to have this magical sense of wonder.
Magic is deception, but it is a deception we enjoy.
To enjoy being deceived, an audience must first suspend its disbelief.
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that, for a moment, constitutes poetic faith.
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience.
Without it, a script is just words.
Augmented reality is just the latest technology.
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity.
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.
We do it every day, while reading novels, watching television or going to the movies.
We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had.
Without this ability there is no magic.
It was Jean Robert-Houdin, France's greatest illusionist, who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller.
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.
MT: Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story.
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.
There are tales of creation and loss, death and resurrection, and obstacles that must be overcome.
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.
Magicians play with fire and steel, defy the fury of the buzzsaw, dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape.
But audiences don't come to see the magician die, they come to see him live.
Because the best stories always have a happy ending.
The tricks of magic have one special element.
They are stories with a twist.
Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines.
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think.
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error.
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable, but do not, in fact, match what is being done in front of them.
MT: In that respect, magic tricks are like jokes.
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination.
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected, we laugh.
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks.
The finale defies logic, gives new insight into the problem, and audiences express their amazement with laughter.
It's fun to be fooled.
One of the key qualities of all stories is that they're made to be shared.
We feel compelled to tell them.
When I do a trick at a party -- that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again.
They want to share the experience.
That makes my job more difficult, because, if I want to surprise them, I need to tell a story that starts the same, but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist.
It keeps me busy.
Now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.
We think in narrative structures.
We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood.
It's a uniquely human achievement.
We all want to share our stories, whether it is the trick we saw at the party, the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.
Today, thanks to technology, we can share those stories as never before, by email, Facebook, blogs, tweets, on TED.com.
The tools of social networking, these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story.
We turn facts into similes and metaphors, and even fantasies.
We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole.
Our stories make us the people we are and, sometimes, the people we want to be.
They give us our identity and a sense of community.
And if the story is a good one, it might even make us smile.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi.
I did that for two reasons.
First of all, I wanted to give you a good visual first impression.
But the main reason I did it is that that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic.
I'm used to a stationary mic.
It's the sensible shoe of public address.
But you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens.
I just become skanky.
So I'm sorry about that.
And I'm already off-message.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have devoted the past 25 years of my life to designing books.
("Yes, BOOKS.
You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper.
You cannot turn them off with a switch.
Tell your kids.") It all sort of started as a benign mistake, like penicillin.
What I really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in New York City.
But upon arrival there, in the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews, I found that the only thing I was offered was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf, a book publisher.
Now I was stupid, but not so stupid that I turned it down.
I had absolutely no idea what I was about to become part of, and I was incredibly lucky.
Soon, it had occurred to me what my job was.
My job was to ask this question: "What do the stories look like?"
Because that is what Knopf is.
It is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.
We bring stories to the public.
The stories can be anything, and some of them are actually true.
But they all have one thing in common: They all need to look like something.
They all need a face.
Why?
To give you a first impression of what you are about to get into.
A book designer gives form to content, but also manages a very careful balance between the two.
Now, the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University, the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard, and wrote the word "Apple" underneath, and he said, "OK.
Listen up."
And he covered up the picture and he said, "You either say this," and then he covered up the word, "or you show this.
But you don't do this."
Because this is treating your audience like a moron.
And they deserve better.
And lo and behold, soon enough, I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Knopf.
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs, and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.
Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style, it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.
The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter; it was a biography.
So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.
So there you are.
Pure content and pure form, side by side.
No fighting, ladies.
Now, what is the story here?
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber.
Genius!
Now, luckily for me, I live and work in New York City, where there are plenty of dinosaurs.
So, I went to the Museum of Natural History, and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop, and I bought a book.
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book, and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.
Now I took this diagram, and I put it in a Photostat machine, and I took a piece of tracing paper, and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast -- -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters -- and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.
I had no idea what I was doing, I had no idea where I was going, but at some point, I stopped -- when to keep going would seem like I was going too far.
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being.
We're in the middle of the process.
And then I just threw some typography on it.
Very basic stuff, slightly suggestive of public park signage.
Everybody in house loved it, and so off it goes to the author.
And even back then, Michael was on the cutting edge.
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.
I miss Michael.
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image, just in case they might want to use it.
Well, they used it.
And I was thrilled.
We all know it was an amazing movie, and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it.
But not too long ago, I came upon this on the Web.
No, that is not me.
But whoever it is, I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like, "Oh my God, that wasn't there last night.
Ooooohh!
I was so wasted."
But if you think about it, from my head to my hands to his leg.
That's a responsibility.
And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.
The book designer's responsibility is threefold: to the reader, to the publisher and, most of all, to the author.
I want you to look at the author's book and say, "Wow!
I need to read that."
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers, and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony.
And the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image, and he wanted to explore what was underlying that.
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of.
But when you do, you don't get what you expect.
You get something that goes much deeper than that.
And David especially loved this design because at book signings, which he does a lot of, he could take a magic marker and do this.
Hello!
Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.
In his 20s, he was a hotshot ad executive, and as Mad Men has told us, a raging alcoholic.
He did not think so, however, but his coworkers did an intervention and they said, "You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution, what I would call the opposite of Type 101.
What does that mean?
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography, you get the assignment of, select a word and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?
Very simple stuff.
This is going to be the opposite of that.
I want this book to look like it's lying to you, desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.
I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!
Then when we went to press, the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running.
Not long after it came out, Augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books.
And this woman came up to it, and she squinted, and she took it to the register, and she said to the man behind the counter, "This one's ruined."
And the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady.
They all came in that way."
Now, that's a good printing job.
A book cover is a distillation.
It is a haiku, if you will, of the story.
This particular story by Osama Tezuka is his epic life of the Buddha, and it's eight volumes in all.
But the best thing is when it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life of the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.
All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book, but once the book designer has read the text, then he has to be an interpreter and a translator.
This story was a real puzzle.
This is what it's about.
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together.
And so, here's the design, right?
And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.
Ahh!
We come upon them, the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.
Huhh!
They've been discovered by the sultan.
He will not be pleased.
Huhh!
And now the sultan is in danger.
And now, we have to open it up to find out what's going to happen next.
Try experiencing that on a Kindle.
Don't get me started.
Seriously.
Much is to be gained by eBooks: ease, convenience, portability.
But something is definitely lost: tradition, a sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness -- a little bit of humanity.
Do you know what John Updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf?
He'd smell it.
Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper, and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.
All those years, all those books, he never got tired of it.
Now, I am all for the iPad, but trust me -- smelling it will get you nowhere.
Now the Apple guys are texting, "Develop odor emission plug-in."
And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.
A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom, she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden, she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left, but very similar, but different.
And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence, sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.
So how do we show this?
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them.
So we're talking about different planes, different pieces of paper.
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum.
It's one part of the form and content.
When it's on top of the paper board, which is the opposite, it forms this.
So even if you don't know anything about this book, you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence.
And the object itself invited exploration interaction, consideration and touch.
This debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list.
This is unheard of, both for us the publisher, and the author.
We're talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling, and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a German Shepherd to explode.
Not exactly Jackie Collins.
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list, eight printings, and still going strong.
So even though we love publishing as an art, we very much know it's a business too, and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky, that great art can be great business.
So that's my story. To be continued.
What does it look like?
Yes. It can, it does and it will, but for this book designer, page-turner, dog-eared place-holder, notes in the margins-taker, ink-sniffer, the story looks like this.
Thank you.
Hi everyone. I'm Sirena.
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.
Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.
I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design?
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology but this has nothing to do with that.
So I did a little research on it.
Well, this is what I found.
Of course, I hope I can memorize it.
The violin is basically made of a wood box and four main strings.
By playing the string, the string vibrates and produces a sound wave.
Sound passes through a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified but ... let me think.
On the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length, that changes the frequency of the sound wave.
Oh, my gosh!
Okay.
This is sort of a technology but I can call it a 16th-century technology.
But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still basically based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound.
Isn't that cool?
Design -- I love its design.
I remember when I was little my mom asked me, would you like to play the violin or the piano?
I looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day.
This is small and lightweight.
I can play from standing, sitting or walking.
And you know what?
The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, I can hide it.
The violin is very beautiful.
Some people relate it as the shape of a lady but, whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff that easily looks dated.
But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, that no two violins sound the same.
Even from the same maker or based on the same model.
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment, but actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining.
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around, it was actually, really bad because it didn't sound like the way I'd heard from other kids -- so horrible and so scratchy -- so it wasn't entertaining at all.
But besides, my brother found this very funny.
Yuk, yuk, yuk.
A few years later I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.
After Mr. Heifetz's concert a lady came over and complimented, "Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight."
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, "Funny, I don't hear anything."
And now, I realize that as the musician, we human beings, we have a great mind, artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment.
Now, I know why I'm here.
At first I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more.
But ... although some of them were quite up there for me.
Like the multi-dimension stuff.
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I can actually get my two dimension correct in school.
But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that ... well, actually, I would also like to stand this for all children is to say, thank you, to all adults for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future world much better.
Thank you.
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship.
And it is.
And yet, it feels natural to us now.
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001.
We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later.
At the time, we knew that it was political.
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.
And when I saw it -- and yet, through the shock, the terrible shock, and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful.
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly.
Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families.
When I saw Aicha in the media, coming over when her son was indicted, and I thought, "What a brave woman.
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."
I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength.
I knew I would find her someday, or we would find each other.
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy.
But when people learned what her son was accused of, she didn't get that sympathy.
But her suffering is equal to mine.
So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about.
Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
So they introduced me to five families.
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.
She was the only mother in the group.
The others were brothers, sisters.
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me.
I suffered a lot as a mother.
I was married when I was 14.
I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16.
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive.
I know she really cried for her son.
But she knows where he is.
My son, I don't know where he is.
I don't know if he's alive.
I don't know if he's tortured.
I don't know what happened to him.
So that's why I decided to tell my story, so that my suffering is something positive for other women.
For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change.
It's up to us women, because we are women, because we love our children.
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together.
It's not against women, it's for us, for us women, for our children.
I talk against violence, against terrorism.
I go to schools to talk to young, Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good.
This is why I'm here in front of you.
PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members.
But we were all so nervous.
"Why does she want to meet us?"
And then she was nervous.
"Why did we want to meet her?"
What did we want from each other?
Before we knew each others' names, or anything, we had embraced and wept.
Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
And Aicha started, and she said, "I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families.
I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished."
But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings.
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.
Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had.
I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much.
And I think it's all about being afraid of the other, but making that step and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.
Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?"
So, Aicha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion?
Because our time is up.
AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other.
You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous.
You must be tolerant.
You have to fight against violence.
And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other.
This is what I wanted to say.
About a year ago, I asked myself a question: "Knowing what I know, why am I not a vegetarian?"
After all, I'm one of the green guys: I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.
I started a site called TreeHugger -- I care about this stuff.
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third.
Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider for our own cats, dogs and other pets.
Environmentally, meat, amazingly, causes more emissions than all of transportation combined: cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.
And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do.
I also knew that I'm not alone.
We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s.
So what was once the special little side treat now is the main, much more regular.
So really, any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.
Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk -- tucking into a big old steak.
So why was I stalling?
I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution.
It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian, and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.
Imagine your last hamburger.
So my common sense, my good intentions, were in conflict with my taste buds.
And I'd commit to doing it later, and not surprisingly, later never came.
Sound familiar?
So I wondered, might there be a third solution?
And I thought about it, and I came up with one.
I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.
It's called weekday veg.
The name says it all: Nothing with a face Monday through Friday.
On the weekend, your choice.
Simple.
If you want to take it to the next level, remember, the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats.
So you want to swap those out with some good, sustainably harvested fish.
It's structured, so it ends up being simple to remember, and it's okay to break it here and there.
After all, cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake.
The program has been great, weekday veg.
My footprint's smaller, I'm lessening pollution, I feel better about the animals, I'm even saving money.
Best of all, I'm healthier, I know that I'm going to live longer, and I've even lost a little weight.
So, please ask yourselves, for your health, for your pocketbook, for the environment, for the animals: What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?
After all, if all of us ate half as much meat, it would be like half of us were vegetarians.
Thank you.
I'm going to start with a little story.
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old, I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete, over four months, slowly wasting away until I was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst.
I had basically digested away my body.
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip, my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog.
That night, I was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.
And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine, insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.
And something festered inside me after this happened.
What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin.
And this is what I thought for a long period of time, and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit, the microbes that do bad things.
And that's where I need my assistant here now.
You may recognize her.
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks, and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building, and they sell toys, giant microbes.
And here we go!
So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.
So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us, and that's what I was focusing on.
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes, and those microbes actually do us good much of the time, rather than killing us.
And so, we've known about this for some period of time.
People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us, I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...
The microbes that cover us.
And if you look at them in the microscope, you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells.
There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.
We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms, just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their DNA.
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years, using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places, including the human body, reading the DNA sequence and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place.
And what's amazing, when you use this technology, for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered in a sea of microbes.
There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.
We have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us.
And so this microbial diversity differs between people, and what people have been thinking about in the last 10, maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes, this microbial cloud in and on us, and the variation between us, may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us.
And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen, but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you.
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body.
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is, what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques in particular, to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us.
And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.
My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave, right around the corner from here at Georgetown.
I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk, and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people.
And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.
And so I started a collaboration with this person, Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.
And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project.
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease, and they sterilized the donor ileum.
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.
They did this because this was common practice in medicine, even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea.
And fortunately, in the course of this project, the transplant surgeons and the other people decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor, and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant.
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.
In the last few years there's been a great expansion in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.
There's something called the Human Microbiome Project that's going on in the United States, and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.
And when people have done a variety of studies, they have learned things such as, when a baby is born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother.
There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections, some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal.
And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system, helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism, and determining our metabolic rate, probably determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways.
And so, these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community, this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.
And one area that I think is very interesting, which many of you may have now that we've thrown microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."
So people are really into cleanliness, right?
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters, people are washing every part of them all of the time, we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities, we take antibiotics excessively.
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick, but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children, has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community.
So the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not, or we can kill it with antibiotics, but what can we do to restore it?
I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you.
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.
There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat, prevent, necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.
And it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants.
But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them, and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.
So what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is, they eat poo -- coprophagia.
And it turns out that many veterinarians, old school veterinarians in particular, have been doing something called "poo tea," not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that, where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.
Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side, and you can put your hand into its rumen, it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system, so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants, where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth, they are delivering a community of probiotics, a community of microbes from a healthy donor, through the other end.
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years.
Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces, from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic C. dif infections in some people.
Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people have come up with this same idea, is that the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.
We should treat it carefully and with respect, and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness, without some real good justification.
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little, and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences.
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not just correlative differences, but causative.
Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this, but people are now using these technologies because they've gotten very cheap, to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.
So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is, I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.
It turns out that my father was an M.D., actually studied hormones.
I told him many times that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."
We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology meeting as family in Quebec.
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee, and drinking everybody's water at the table, and I think they all thought I was a druggie.
But the reason I'm telling you this is that the medical community, my father as an example, sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.
We can't see it most of the time.
It's invisible.
They're microbes. They're tiny.
But we can see them through their DNA, we can see them through the effects that they have on people.
And what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine.
It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us, but it might.
What we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people, so that we can understand what they're doing to our lives.
We are them.
They are us.
Thank you.
I'd like to start tonight by something completely different, asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean, and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.
And it's a lively and a lovely place, but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing, our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland, but also, most recently, with climate change, and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans, more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.
And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful, and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday, but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up.
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
So it may be good for the waistline, but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish.
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola, whose primary prey are jellyfish.
This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records" for being the world's heaviest bony fish.
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.
And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish -- that its favorite food is the moon jelly.
So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way, even if one is eating the other.
Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name.
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior, they lie out and bask on the surface.
Their other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian, but it's actually Latin for millstone, and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.
It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.
And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place, was this terribly bizarre shape.
You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek, and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength, and then you look at the sunfish.
And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution.
The Mola's no exception.
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs, and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction -- oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know, about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs -- we're going to head to the high seas.
And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing, and we turn our puffer into the Mola.
You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.
They look -- maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps, but in fact, in fact they are the -- they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea, right up there with flat fish.
They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.
And in terms of fishes -- fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern, just 50 million years ago, so -- so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.
They start as little eggs, and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs, can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine -- and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.
And from that little egg, they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry, and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
That's a little diver up there in the corner.
They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.
600 million.
Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby, and you had to feed this thing.
That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.
Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but -- we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
I said, now, that's a true American.
So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas, because schooling used to be salvation for fishes, but it's suicide for fishes now.
But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school, they still get caught in nets as by-catch.
If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination, then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators -- how they live their lives, like the Mola.
And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch -- up to 26 percent of the drift net.
And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries, they make up up to 90 percent.
So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.
And how do you do that?
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.
This is an open ocean creature.
It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.
How do you get insight?
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?
Well, there's some great new technology that has just recently become available, and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.
And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.
That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity, which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.
And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset.
And we didn't even have -- we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.
So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.
Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.
But they have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.
And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.
They don't seem to mind, so far.
So what are we trying to find out?
We're focusing on the Pacific.
We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.
And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents, using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.
We'd love to tag in Monterey.
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.
Not this time of year -- it's more around October.
And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey -- but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay, rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style, and then tosses them back and forth.
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior, it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.
The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds, so we head down south, to San Diego.
Not so many California sea lions down there.
And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily, and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there.
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.
And they come and give the Molas -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says, "I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."
And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head, and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean -- because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.
And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right, will say, "Okay, scratch me right there."
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle -- and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific; we've gone over to another part of the Pacific, and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.
And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.
And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
Well, not the one we tagged!
And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone, to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe, I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording.
The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars, so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.
And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data, we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?
Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?
And we found that they kind of are homebodies.
They're not big migrators.
This is their track: we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.
And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.
And that's kind of their home range.
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure, that population doesn't get replenished.
So that's a very important piece of data.
But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.
They're super industrious.
And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we -- they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day.
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.
Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade, and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.
They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power, and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.
And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer -- which a whole variety of food's in that layer.
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker, they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.
We see the same pattern -- now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas, a real three-dimensional play.
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life, where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that.
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals, and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.
It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.
Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered, and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.
But people would write into the site with all sorts of, all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared -- a shared love and an interest in the oceans.
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns, Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in, united by their love of life.
And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself: "One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.
If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.
Okay, so 90 percent of my photographic process is, in fact, not photographic.
It involves a campaign of letter writing, research and phone calls to access my subjects, which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia.
And oddly, the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World, a seemingly innocuous site.
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence: "Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to."
Photography threatens fantasy.
They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth.
But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.
Over a five year period following September 11th, when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders, most notably weapons of mass destruction, I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation, mythology and daily functioning.
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real, and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.
It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph.
And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
And the outsider can never really reach the core.
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.
It's titled, "An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar," and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.
In this context I'll just show you a few.
This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State, where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water.
A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.
And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America, which you can see here.
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.
And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image, and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image.
So, at best, the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground.
But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts.
This is a cryopreservation unit, and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger, who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health, with advancements in science and technology, all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty.
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state, allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage.
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen, allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse, to simulate the loss of virginity.
This is a jury simulation deliberation room, and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.
And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for.
This process costs 60,000 dollars.
This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room, a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
On that table you can see 48 hours' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.
There is a pig's head and African cane rats.
And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there.
I do take certain liberties and intervene.
And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting, so I spent some time with the smells and items.
This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.
And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.
And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-American thoughts and aesthetics.
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency, and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.
This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility, and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition.
And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene.
This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States.
It's a research crop marijuana grow room.
And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things -- they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security -- and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed.
These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, connecting North America to Europe.
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability.
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed.
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.
And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired, and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity.
And Playboy is always in the top few.
But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs.
This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine, where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza.
This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.
And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the United States.
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.
All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding -- that would be mother to son, father to daughter, sister to brother -- to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger.
Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.
And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth.
It's a very violent process that is little known.
And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.
Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.
He has since passed away, but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.
This, on a lighter note, is at George Lucas' personal archive.
This is the Death Star.
And it's shown here in its true orientation.
In the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi," its mirror image is presented.
They flip the negative.
And you can see the photoetched brass detailing, and the painted acrylic facade.
In the context of the film, this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire, capable of annihilating planets and civilizations, and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.
Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat, and this is one of the structures that exists in that city.
It's called the World Church of God.
It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.
And after I took this photograph, they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.
And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice.
And we put that wall around the World Church of God, and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army.
And I put them into my photograph.
This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity.
And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.
It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq, which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq.
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.
It's titled "The Innocents."
And for the men in these photographs, photography had been used to create a fantasy.
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.
I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction, and its influence on memory, which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.
For the men in these photographs, the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification.
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images.
But through exposure to composite sketches, Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups, eyewitness testimony can change.
I'll give you an example from a case.
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker.
She saw some similarities in one of the photographs, but couldn't quite make a positive identification.
Days later, she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs, except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array.
And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory, if there ever was an actual memory.
Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals, and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications.
Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location, where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.
He was convicted by an all-white jury of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.
Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison.
But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school.
He served 18 years of a death sentence.
I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho.
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction.
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification, the alibi location.
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.
So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction, in both his life and in photography.
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.
He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.
Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest, where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana, in this very room to hide from the police.
He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.
The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification, days later, from a photo array.
Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a 10 year old boy at a carnival.
He is photographed at his alibi location.
Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club, and served 11 years of a death sentence.
I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction.
And the state's key witness in Ron's case was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.
Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime, was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence, for several charges of rape and robbery.
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.
He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery, and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.
Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward, but said he looked too old.
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier, which they entered into a photo array days later, and he was positively identified.
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant, and our eyes are easily deceived.
That's it. Thank you.
At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we're going to become, and then when we become those people, we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.
So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get.
Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry.
Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.
On and on and on.
The question is, as a psychologist, that fascinates me is, why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret?
Now, I think one of the reasons -- I'll try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time.
Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan, that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year.
But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl?
Is it teenage years?
Is it middle age?
Is it old age?
The answer, it turns out, for most people, is now, wherever now happens to be.
What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion, an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives.
Let me give you some data to back up that claim.
So here's a study of change in people's personal values over time.
Here's three values.
Everybody here holds all of them, but you probably know that as you grow, as you age, the balance of these values shifts.
So how does it do so?
Well, we asked thousands of people.
We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years, and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years.
And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis, because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people, say, 18 years old, to the reports of people who were 28, and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan.
Here's what we found.
First of all, you are right, change does slow down as we age, but second, you're wrong, because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.
At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set, people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years.
We call this the "end of history" illusion.
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect, you can connect these two lines, and what you see here is that 18-year-olds anticipate changing only as much as 50-year-olds actually do.
Now it's not just values.
It's all sorts of other things.
For example, personality.
Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality: neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.
Again, we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years, and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years, and what we found, well, you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over, because once again the rate of change does slow as we age, but at every age, people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade.
And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality.
You can ask people about their likes and dislikes, their basic preferences.
For example, name your best friend, your favorite kind of vacation, what's your favorite hobby, what's your favorite kind of music.
People can name these things.
We ask half of them to tell us, "Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years?"
and half of them to tell us, "Did that change over the last 10 years?"
And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now, and here it is again: people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in 10 years, the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in 10 years, and yet, people who are 10 years older all say, "Eh, you know, that's really changed."
Does any of this matter?
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn't have consequences?
No, it matters quite a bit, and I'll give you an example of why.
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways.
Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician 10 years ago.
I put mine up on the screen to help you along.
Now we asked people to predict for us, to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert 10 years from now, and on average, people said they would pay 129 dollars for that ticket.
And yet, when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite 10 years ago perform today, they say only 80 dollars.
Now, in a perfectly rational world, these should be the same number, but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability.
Why does this happen?
We're not entirely sure, but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining.
Most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago, but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be, and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine, it's not likely to happen.
Sorry, when people say "I can't imagine that," they're usually talking about their own lack of imagination, and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they're describing.
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.
It transforms our preferences.
It reshapes our values.
It alters our personalities.
We seem to appreciate this fact, but only in retrospect.
Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade.
It's as if, for most of us, the present is a magic time.
It's a watershed on the timeline.
It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves.
Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished.
The person you are right now is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been.
The one constant in our life is change.
Thank you.
Think about your day for a second.
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door, encountered new colleagues and had great discussions, and felt in awe when you found something new.
But I bet there's something you didn't think about today -- something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all.
And that's that all the sensations, feelings, decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain.
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous -- but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain, and to see the intricacy of what lies within.
And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.
Now unlike a human-designed computer, where there's a fairly small number of different parts -- we know how they work, because we humans designed them -- the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells, maybe tens of thousands.
They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules.
And they project and connect to different brain regions, and they also change different ways in different disease states.
There's a class of cells, a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.
It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.
It's called the basket cell.
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about.
New ones are being discovered everyday.
As just a second example: these pyramidal cells, large cells, they can span a significant fraction of the brain.
They're excitatory.
And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy.
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device.
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs, which then, if they pass a certain threshold, will go to thousands of downstream partners.
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so, happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells, as long as you live and think and feel.
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?
Ideally, we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.
If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash, what they can initiate and sustain.
If we could turn them off, then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for.
And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today.
And honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years, through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off, both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans.
Now before I tell you about the technology, the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room, if we live long enough, will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.
Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them, and the numbers don't do it justice though.
These disorders -- schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, depression, addiction -- they not only steal our time to live, they change who we are.
They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people.
Now in the 20th century, there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders, and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders, practically none of them can be considered to be cured.
And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical.
This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance.
That's also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too.
Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.
And for Parkinson's disease, Cochlear implants, these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder.
But electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance, which is where that phrase, in part, comes from.
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix.
So again, we're sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control.
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go?
So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago, I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist, and the first thing I thought about was, if these neurons are electrical devices, all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance.
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell, but not its neighbors, that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells, figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded.
And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry.
Now how are we going to do that?
Well there are many molecules that exist in nature, which are able to convert light into electricity.
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells.
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow, then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.
And their neighbors, which don't have the molecule, would not.
There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen, and that's the ability to get light into the brain.
And to do that -- the brain doesn't feel pain -- you can put -- taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on -- optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate, in animal models for example, in pre-clinical studies, these neurons and to see what they do.
So how do we do this?
Around 2004, in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth, this vision came to fruition.
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild, and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally.
And it senses light with a little eye-spot, which works not unlike how our eye works.
In its membrane, or its boundary, it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity.
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.
When blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot, and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery.
So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons.
And because it's a protein, it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.
So all we've got to do is take that DNA, put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus, and put it into neurons.
So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy, and lots of viruses were coming along.
So this turned out to be very simple to do.
And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004, we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron.
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell, like putting solar panels on a roof, and the next thing you know, you have a neuron which can be activated with light.
So this is very powerful.
One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors.
And you can do that; you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others.
And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells.
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics.
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do, you can take a complex network, use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network.
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated.
So for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier -- the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory.
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -- and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course -- and then flash blue light over the entire brain network, just these cells are going to be driven.
And when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal, so they don't seem to be averse against that.
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do, what their power is in computing in the brain, but you can also use this to try to figure out -- well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells, if indeed they're atrophied.
Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we're using this, both at the scientific, clinical and pre-clinical levels.
One of the questions we've confronted is, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward?
Because if you could find those, those would be some of the signals that could drive learning.
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward.
And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.
So if we could figure out what cells they are, we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against, or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability.
So to do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group, where one side of this little box, if the animal goes there, the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.
So if these cells can mediate reward, the animal should go there more and more.
And so that's what happens.
This animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there, and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.
And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times.
These are the dopamine neurons, which some of you may have heard about, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.
Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough, indeed, to drive learning.
Now we can generalize the idea.
Instead of one point in the brain, we can devise devices that span the brain, that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns -- arrays of optical fibers, each coupled to its own independent miniature light source.
And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to-date in a dish -- like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen.
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders.
And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear.
This goes back to the Pavlovian days.
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning -- where a tone ends with a brief shock.
The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.
And over time -- in this case, a mouse, which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone.
The animal will react by freezing, sort of like a deer in the headlights.
Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear?
So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear.
But we activate targets in the brain, different ones, using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide, in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.
And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now.
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex, a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states.
And the animal's going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there.
There's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing.
This tone used to mean bad news.
And there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner, so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later.
And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.
Okay, there it goes. Right now.
And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment, that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory.
Now over the last couple of years, we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.
If we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.
If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds, you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded.
And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.
And we found all sorts of molecules, they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins, that respond to green and yellow light.
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin.
Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go.
Consider, for example, a condition like epilepsy, where the brain is overactive.
Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment, one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.
But that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects.
What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time, until the seizure dies away, and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state -- sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state.
So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light, and we beam light in, and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure, we're hoping to be able to turn it off.
And so we don't have data to show you on this front, but we're very excited about this.
Now I want to close on one story, which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control, can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic.
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted.
Maybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants, which allow them to hear.
There's another thing, which is you've got to get these genes into cells.
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus, which probably most of us around this room have, and it doesn't have any symptoms, which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body.
And so far, there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus.
There's one last elephant in the room, the proteins themselves, which come from algae and bacteria and fungi, and all over the tree of life.
Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains, so what is our brain going to do if we put that in?
Are the cells going to tolerate it?
Will the immune system react?
In its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet -- but we're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this, and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light.
So it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it.
I wanted to close with one story, which we think could potentially be a clinical application.
Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors, our light sensors that are in the back of our eye, are gone.
And the retina, of course, is a complex structure.
Now let's zoom in on it here, so we can see it in more detail.
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top, and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells, relay the information to the brain, where we see that as perception.
In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa, or macular degeneration, the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.
Now how could you repair this?
It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored, because there's nothing for the drug to bind to.
On the other hand, light can still get into the eye.
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in.
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras.
And because there's so many of these cells in the eye, potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras.
So this is some work that we're doing.
It's being led by one of our collaborators, Alan Horsager at USC, and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience, which is funded by the NIH.
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.
It's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there.
And the goal, of course, of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port.
Now mice are smart, so this mouse solves the maze eventually, but he does a brute-force search.
He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.
So he's not using vision to do it.
These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.
And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach.
So how are we going to solve this?
We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive.
Light is converted to electricity on them.
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus.
And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again.
And to point out the power of this: these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.
So this pre-clinical study, I think, bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future.
To close, I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology.
We're developing these tools, but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world, so people can study and try to treat different disorders.
And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them, we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier, practically none of which are cured, and in the 21st century make them history.
Thank you.
Juan Enriquez: So some of the stuff is a little dense.
But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs, and being able to target those specifically is a first step.
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors, like an on/off switch.
Ed Boyden: That's right.
JE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code.
Right, yeah.
So with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.
And by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities.
JE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them?
Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard.
We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too.
So we can record information and then drive information back in -- sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing.
JE: Well, that might change a couple things.
Thank you.
I started with paragliding.
Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider, with the possibility to fly cross-country, distance, just with the use of thermals to soar.
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider.
From there I started with skydiving.
In this picture you can see there is a four-way skydive, four people flying together, and on the left hand side it's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump, for the film itself and also for the judging.
From regular, relative skydiving I went on to freeflying.
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.
You can see the skydiver with the red suit, he's in a stand-up position.
The one with the yellow-green suit, he's flying head-down.
And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation in freefall also, with the helmet cam to film this jump.
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.
You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board, there is a lot of force, a lot of power.
Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves."
From there I went on to wingsuit flying.
Wingsuit flying is a suit, that I can make fly, just only with my body.
If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit, I can make it fly.
And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface.
With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance.
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.
From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects, like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth -- meaning mountains, cliffs.
It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall, with all the visual references.
So my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before.
So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump the Eiger North Face in Switzerland.
Two years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn, a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here.
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau, three very famous mountains in Switzerland.
The special thing on these three jumps were, I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
So with all this knowledge, I also wanted to get into stunts.
So with some friends we started to do different tricks, like for example this jump here, I jumped from a paraglider.
Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me, because it was very cold in Austria where we did this filming.
Everybody sitting in a basket, and I was on top of the balloon, ready to slide down with my skysurf board.
Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.
Extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step, if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge.
Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition, so I'm training a lot.
You need to have the best possible equipment.
And probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.
And all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly.
So for 2009, I'm training hard for my two new projects.
The first one, I want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.
And I want to set a new record, with the longest distance ever flown.
For my second project, I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before.
So now, on the following movie you will see that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in English.
Enjoy, and thank you very much.
I have some questions.
I think we all might have some questions.
Question one: so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does?
Because it looks like it might.
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much.
I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.
I know the answer to this, but how do you land?
UE: Parachute.
We have to open a parachute just seconds before, I would say, impact.
It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.
Yet.
But people are trying.
Are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it?
UE: It's a dream.
We're still working on it and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance, to get more knowledge.
And I believe soon.
All right.
Well we will watch this space.
But I have two more questions.
What is the -- there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit.
Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?
UE: Nope.
It's just smoke.
Coming off of you?
UE: Hopefully not.
That seems dangerous.
UE: No, smoke is for two reasons, you can see the speed, you can see the way where I was flying.
That's reason number one.
And reason number two: it's much easier for the camera guy to film If I'm using smoke.
Ah, I see.
So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked.
One more question.
What do you do to to cover your face?
Because I just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards.
Are you in a helmet?
Are you in goggles?
UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.
And is that how you usually fly?
UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet.
In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet because of landings -- usually it's difficult -- it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.
So you have to be prepared.
Right.
Now is there anything you don't do?
Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"
UE: Oh of course, of course.
Some people have crazy ideas and -- ...a round of applause...
UE: Thank you very much.
What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what's scheduled.
Foreign policy, you can figure that out by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody, but — — I want to talk about young people and structure, young people and structure.
This was last Wednesday afternoon at a school in Brooklyn, New York, at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.
And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.
They were around me in three directions.
You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority.
You'll notice that the building is rather austere.
It's an old New York school building, nothing fancy.
They still have old blackboards and whatnot.
And there are about 300 kids in this school, and the school's been going now for four years, and they're about to graduate their first class.
Twenty-two people are graduating, and all 22 are going to college.
They all come from homes where there is, for the most part, just one person in the home, usually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it, and they come here for their education and for their structure.
Now I had this picture taken, and it was put up on my Facebook page last week, and somebody wrote in, "Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?"
And then they said, "But he looks good."
He does look good, because kids need structure, and the trick I play in all of my school appearances is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids, I then invite them to ask questions, and when they raise their hands, I say, "Come up," and I make them come up and stand in front of me.
I make them stand at attention like a soldier.
Put your arms straight down at your side, look up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead, and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear.
No slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff.
And this young man, his name is -- his last name Cruz -- he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral.
So people think I'm being unkind to this kid.
No, we're having a little fun.
And the thing about it, I've done this for years, the younger they are, the more fun it is.
When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group, I have to figure out how to keep them quiet.
You know that they'll always start yakking.
And so I play a little game with them before I make them stand at attention.
I say, "Now listen. In the army, when we want you to pay attention, we have a command. It's called 'at ease.' It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up.
Do you understand?"
""Let's practice. Everybody start chatting."
And I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, "At ease!"
"Huh!"
"Yes, General.
Yes, General."
Try it with your kids. See if it works.
I don't think so.
But anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously from my military experience.
Because for the majority of my adult life, I worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them.
And we would bring them into the army, and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure, put them in ranks, make them all wear the same clothes, cut all their hair off so they look alike, make sure that they are standing in ranks.
We teach them how to go right face, left face, so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions.
It gives them structure.
And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant.
And they hate him.
And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them, and telling them to do all kinds of awful things.
But then the most amazing thing happens over time.
Once that structure is developed, once they understand the reason for something, once they understand, "Mama ain't here, son.
I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy.
And that's just the way it is.
You got that, son?
Yeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers: yes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.
Don't start telling me why you didn't do something.
It's yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir."
"You didn't shave. ""But sir —" "No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning.
I'm telling you you didn't shave."
"No excuse, sir. ""Attaboy, you're learning fast."
But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure.
In 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature.
And you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant.
They come to respect him.
And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children.
I spend a lot of time with youth groups, and I say to people, "When does the education process begin?"
We're always talking about, "Let's fix the schools.
Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools.
Let's get it all online."
That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer.
But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with.
When does the learning process begin?
Does it begin in first grade?
No, no, it begins the first time a child in a mother's arms looks up at the mother and says, "Oh, this must be my mother.
She's the one who feeds me.
Oh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there, she takes care of me.
It's her language I will learn."
And at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age, but by three months, that's her.
And if the person doing it, whether it's the mother or grandmother, whoever's doing it, that is when the education process begins.
That's when language begins.
That's when love begins. That's when structure begins.
That's when you start to imprint on the child that "you are special, you are different from every other child in the world.
And we're going to read to you."
A child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school.
A child who doesn't know his or her colors or doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes, doesn't know how to do those things, and doesn't know how to do something that goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind.
Mind your manners!
Mind your adults!
Mind what you're saying!
This is the way children are raised properly.
And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're, much to the distress of my children, they are acting just like we did. You know?
You imprint them.
And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school.
And I'm working at all the energy I have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool, we need Head Start, we need prenatal care.
The education process begins even before the child is born, and if you don't do that, you're going to have difficulty.
And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing, they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go, and then they realize they're not like the other first graders who know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.
And by the third grade, the kids who didn't have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they're behind, and what do they do?
They act it out. They act it out, and they're on their way to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts.
It's predictable.
If you're not at the right reading level at third grade, you are a candidate for jail at age 18, and we have the highest incarceration rate because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life.
The last chapter in my book is called "The Gift of a Good Start."
The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life.
I was privileged to have that kind of good start.
I was not a great student.
I was a public school kid in New York City, and I didn't do well at all.
I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript from kindergarten through college.
I wanted it when I was writing my first book.
I wanted to see if my memory was correct, and, my God, it was.
Straight C everywhere.
And I finally bounced through high school, got into the City College of New York with a 78.3 average, which I shouldn't have been allowed in with, and then I started out in engineering, and that only lasted six months.
And then I went into geology, "rocks for jocks." This is easy.
And then I found ROTC.
I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing, and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way.
And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.
And I say to young kids everywhere, as you're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you, always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing, and when you find those two things together, man, you got it.
That's what's going on. And that's what I found.
Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.
I'd been there four and a half going on five years, and my grades were not doing particularly well, and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.
And so they said, "But he does so well in ROTC.
Look, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else."
And so they said, "Look, let's take his ROTC grades and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens."
And they did, and it brought me up to 2.0.
Yep.
They said, "It's good enough for government work.
Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again."
So they shipped me off to the army, and lo and behold, many years later, I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had.
So, I tell young people everywhere, it ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life that determines where you end up in life, and you are blessed to be living in a country that, no matter where you start, you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself, you believe in the society and the country, and you believe that you can self-improve and educate yourself as you go along.
And that's the key to success.
But it begins with the gift of a good start.
If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids, if we don't invest at the earliest age, we're going to be running into difficulties.
It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall and almost 50 percent of our minority population living in low-income areas, because they're not getting the gift of a good start.
My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family, a good family, but having a family that said to me, "Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats in 1920 and 1924.
We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out."
If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people that, "You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out," they'd said, "We're dropping you out.
We'll get another kid."
They stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame: "Don't you shame this family."
Sometimes I would get in trouble, and my parents were coming home, and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen, and I would sit there saying to myself, "Okay, look, take the belt and hit me, but, God, don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again."
It devastated me when my mother did that to me.
And I also had this extended network.
Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe, a family, a community.
In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings.
I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers, but there were these tenement buildings, and these women were always hanging out one of the windows, leaning on a pillow.
They never left.
I, so help me God, I grew up walking those streets, and they were always there.
They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked.
They never did anything.
But what they did was keep us in play.
They kept us in play.
And they didn't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general, and they never expected any generals in the family, as long as you got an education and then you got a job.
"Don't give us any of that self-actualization stuff.
You get a job and get out of the house.
We don't have time to waste for that.
And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys."
And so, it's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families, all families.
And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people, and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren, it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure, if you reach back and help, if you mentor, if you invest in boys and girls clubs, if you work with your school system, make sure it's the best school system, and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem, not just downtown Montessori on the West Side.
All of us have to have a commitment to do that.
And we're not just investing in the kids.
We're investing in our future.
We're going to be a minority-majority country in one more generation.
Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority.
And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority.
We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours, a country that is like no other, a country that amazes me every single day, a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other.
That's how the system's supposed to work.
It's a country of such contrasts, but it's a nation of nations.
We touch every nation. Every nation touches us.
We are a nation of immigrants.
That's why we need sound immigration policy.
But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler.
Gotta have a dirty water dog.
And no matter where I am or what I'm doing, I've got to do that.
I even did it when I was Secretary of State.
I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria —  — be walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler.
In those days, I had five bodyguards around me and three New York City police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue.
And I would order the hot dog from the guy, and he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars -- "I've got a green card!
I've got a green card!"
"It's okay, it's okay."
But now I'm alone. I'm alone.
I've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing.
But I gotta have my hot dog.
I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening down by Columbus Circle.
And the scene repeats itself so often.
I'll go up and ask for my hot dog, and the guy will fix it, and as he's finishing, he'll say, "I know you. I see you on television.
You're, well, you're General Powell."
"Yes, yes. ""Oh ... " I hand him the money.
"No, General. You can't pay me. I've been paid.
America has paid me. I never forget where I came from.
But now I'm an American. Sir, thank you."
I accept the generosity, continue up the street, and it washes over me, my God, it's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago.
So we are still that magnificent country, but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world, and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind.
Thank you very much.
So I didn't always make my living from music.
For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university, this was my day job.
I was a self-employed living statue called the 8-Foot Bride, and I love telling people l did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life?
Hello.
I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower and some intense eye contact.
And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away.
So I had the most profound encounters with people, especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks, and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street, and we would sort of fall in love a little bit.
And my eyes would say, "Thank you.
I see you."
And their eyes would say, "Nobody ever sees me.
Thank you."
And I would get harassed sometimes.
People would yell at me from their passing cars.
"Get a job!"
And I'd be, like, "This is my job."
But it hurt, because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair, shameful.
I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box.
And for the economists out there, you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income, which was shocking to me given I had no regular customers, but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday.
It was consistent.
And meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band, the Dresden Dolls.
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.
I wrote the songs, and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue, and as we started touring, I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people, because I loved it.
So after all of our shows, we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people, and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us, and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows, and they would pass the hat, and then they would come in and join us onstage, so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests.
And then Twitter came along, and made things even more magic, because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere.
So I would need a piano to practice on, and an hour later I would be at a fan's house.
This is in London.
People would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us.
This is in Seattle.
Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.
This is a library in Auckland.
On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat, because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast, and they showed up care of this dude, Chris from Newport Beach, who says hello.
I once tweeted, where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?
And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in, and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death.
And I love this kind of random closeness, which is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing.
In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless, and in punk squats, everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless, clearly making it the better option.
My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18-year-old girl, still living at home, and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras.
And that night, her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds.
And I lay there thinking, these people have so little.
Is this fair?
And in the morning, her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible, and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English, "Your music has helped my daughter so much.
Thank you for staying here.
We're all so grateful."
And I thought, this is fair.
This is this.
A couple months later, I was in Manhattan, and I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight, I'm ringing a doorbell on the Lower East Side, and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone.
I've always been with my band or my crew.
Is this what stupid people do?
Is this how stupid people die?
And before I can change my mind, the door busts open.
She's an artist.
He's a financial blogger for Reuters, and they're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath, and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that.
So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot.
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing.
You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other.
I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get themselves some extra money, something that I did a lot.
And as usual, the band was psyched, but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there.
It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat.
And I recognized his fear of "Is this fair?"
and "Get a job."
And meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger.
We signed with a major label.
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret.
It's not for everybody.
Well, maybe it's for you.
We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record.
And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks, and the label considers this a failure.
And I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"
They were like, "No, the sales are going down.
It's a failure."
And they walk off.
Right at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig, and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $10 bill, and he says, "I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend."
"But I read your blog, I know you hate your label.
I just want you to have this money."
And this starts happening all the time.
I become the hat after my own gigs, but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people, and unlike the guy in the opening band, I've actually had a lot of practice standing there.
Thank you.
And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street.
So I fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra, I turned to crowdfunding, and I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made, and I asked my crowd to catch me.
And the goal was 100,000 dollars.
My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million, which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date.
And you can see how many people it is.
It's about 25,000 people.
And the media asked, "Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy.
How did you make all these people pay for music?"
And the real answer is, I didn't make them. I asked them.
And through the very act of asking people, I'd connected with them, and when you connect with them, people want to help you.
It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists.
They don't want to ask for things.
But it's not easy.
It's not easy to ask.
And a lot of artists have a problem with this.
Asking makes you vulnerable.
And I got a lot of criticism online after my Kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices, specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer, and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website.
And this hurt in a really familiar way.
And people saying, "You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help," really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, "Get a job."
Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk, and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd, an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them.
So this is slightly not safe for work.
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin.
At the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me.
Now let me tell you, if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers, I recommend this, especially if those strangers are drunk German people.
This was a ninja master-level fan connection, because what I was really saying here was, I trust you this much.
Should I?
Show me.
For most of human history, musicians, artists, they've been part of the community, connectors and openers, not untouchable stars.
Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance, but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back.
It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough.
So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price.
They see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done, the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell, I don't see these things as risk.
I see them as trust.
Now, the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street, they're getting there.
But the perfect tools aren't going to help us if we can't face each other and give and receive fearlessly, but, more important, to ask without shame.
My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box, so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes, and we see each other.
And I think when we really see each other, we want to help each other.
I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question, which is, "How do we make people pay for music?"
What if we started asking, "How do we let people pay for music?"
Thank you.
The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone.
They've changed the world.
However, largely to our surprise, they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state.
It turned out that the capability to collect data, information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies, mostly U.S. intelligence agencies, watching over the rest of the world.
We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6.
Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others.
And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world.
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist.
We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined.
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah.
Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center.
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting.
And it's a pretty big building.
How big?
Well, I can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn't really tell you very much.
Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.
You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in.
This is five times larger.
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?
Right?
It's pretty big.
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades.
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all.
And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone.
Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners.
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States.
And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.
In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.
Right?
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us, all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.
But don't get me wrong: There are actually types of surveillance that are okay.
I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine.
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications.
I'm not arguing that at all, but that's not what programs like PRISM are about.
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings.
They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent.
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.
And that's not true.
Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already.
Our worst fears might have been something like this, but we didn't know this was happening.
Now we know for a fact it's happening.
We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM.
We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans.
We didn't know about DoubleArrow.
We did not know about Skywriter -- all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies.
But now we do.
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.
And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file.
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, it's going to take millions of years.
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.
You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result.
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result.
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind.
But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job.
This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic.
That's what they're trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, they're trying to find ways around the encryption.
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose.
They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control.
So what do we actually know about the leaks?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden.
The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to.
They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers.
So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others: Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on.
And every single one of these companies denies.
They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data.
Yet we have these files.
So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation?
And one explanation would be that these parties, these service providers, are not cooperating.
Instead, they've been hacked.
That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.
In this case, they've been hacked by their own government.
That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government.
And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well.
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies.
Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.
And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium.
And what this really means is that an E.U.
country on purpose, and they discuss it in their slides completely casually, business as usual.
Here's the primary target, here's the secondary target, here's the teaming.
They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub.
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, "Success," when they gain access to services like this.
All countries spy.
And maybe that's true.
Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example.
Let's take, for example, Sweden.
I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.
All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support?
And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day.
And then we turn it around.
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services?
And the answer is zero.
So this is not balanced.
It's not balanced by any means, not even close.
And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States.
Like, Skype used to be secure.
It used to be end-to-end encrypted.
Then it was sold to the United States.
Today, it no longer is secure.
So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome.
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists.
It's the war on terror.
You shouldn't worry about it.
Well, it's not the war on terror.
Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?
It's not the war on terror.
Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists?
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U.
conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom?
Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all?
But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide.
Feel free to survey me if that helps.
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough.
Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure that's the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you can't keep a secret.
But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this.
And I have nothing to hide.
I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.
Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency, especially a foreign intelligence agency.
And if we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother.
And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence.
And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?
What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something?
And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either.
Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.
Privacy is nonnegotiable.
It should be built in to all the systems we use.
And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines.
You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes.
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families.
Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you.
And this is all the kind of information we are giving away, we are giving away to the United States.
And surveillance changes history.
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon.
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today.
And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.
Her email was read, and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said, "If there is no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy."
That's what it's about.
Privacy is the building block of our democracies.
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies.
So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters.
So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.
Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations -- and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming.
So, what is there to be done?
Should we worry.
No, we shouldn't worry.
We should be angry, because this is wrong, and it's rude, and it should not be done.
But that's not going to really change the situation.
What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States.
And that's much easier said than done.
How do you do that?
A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.
But maybe you don't have to do it alone.
Maybe you can do it together with other countries.
The solution is open source.
By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself.
It only has to solve one little problem.
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state.
Thank you very much.
The substance of things unseen.
Cities, past and future.
In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves, or perhaps pass through to another world.
Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, "As the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes, a fresh green breast of the new world."
My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project.
We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609, when he sailed into New York harbor.
And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts, and if I have time still, an epilogue.
So, Act I: A Map Found.
So, I didn't grow up in New York.
I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here, in the Red Rock Canyon.
And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes.
And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies, I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology.
Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals.
This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world.
And over the last decade, I traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos.
But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City.
And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals?
How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?"
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them.
I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan.
I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City.
I read that New York City was the first mega-city, a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950.
I started seeing paintings like this.
For those of you who are from New York, this is 125th street under the West Side Highway.
It was once a beach.
And this painting has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock.
And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.
Or this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village.
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University -- sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.
And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it.
And I couldn't find that palm tree.
What's that palm tree doing there?
So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map.
And it's this map you see here.
It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in.
This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City.
And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.
And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was, right at the end of the American Revolution.
Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.
And this is City Hall Park.
So the city basically extended to City Hall Park.
And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished, things that have disappeared.
This is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City for its first 200 years, and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that.
You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now, and the beaches that come up from the Battery, all the way to 42nd St.
This map was made for military reasons.
They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications that they built.
But they're also mapping things of ecological interest, also military interest: the hills, the marshes, the streams.
This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water, which used to run its way through Greenwich Village.
Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.
Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.
Here is Times Square, the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.
So I saw this remarkable map in a book.
And I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat."
So, after some work we were able to georeference it, which allows us to put the modern streets on the city, and the buildings, and the open spaces, so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.
We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams, and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today.
So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography.
But I had another idea about this map.
If we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings, and if we take away the open spaces, then we could take this map.
If we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time.
We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals: to the hills, to the streams, to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches, the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.
Then, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology, and the surface geology, what the glaciers leave, if we make the soil map, with the 17 soil classes, that are defined by the National Conservation Service, if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were, then we can calculate the slopes.
We can calculate the aspect.
We can calculate the winter wind exposure -- so, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape.
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.
We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.
And we built a probability map about where they might have been.
So, the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan, places that are close to water, places that are near the harbor to fish, places protected from the winter winds.
We know that there was a Lenape settlement down here by the Collect Pond.
And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture, that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash, the "Three Sisters" garden.
So, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been.
And the old fields, the successional fields that go.
And we might think of these as abandoned.
But, in fact, they're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants.
And they have become successional shrub lands, and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities.
And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types.
You can think of these as neighborhoods, as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood -- that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities, the beaches.
And 55 is a lot.
On a per-area basis, Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does, than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.
So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.
So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees, the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan, the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore, the beavers on all the streams, the black bears, and the Native Americans, to study how they used and thought about their landscape.
We wanted to try and map these.
And to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs.
Where do they get their food?
Where do they get their water?
Where do they get their shelter?
Where do they get their reproductive resources?
To an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat, but to most people, the intersection of these is their home.
So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves, you know, what beavers need is "A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows, near the water."
That's the best thing for a beaver.
So we just started making a list.
Here is the beaver. And here is the stream, and the aspen and the alder and the willow.
As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver.
Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places.
Or the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites.
And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs.
But a beaver also needs things.
And that having it on either side means that we can link it together, that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species.
Moreover, we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist, but you can look up what an aspen needs.
An aspen needs fire and dry soils.
And you can look at what a wet meadow needs.
And it need beavers to create the wetlands, and maybe some other things.
But you can also talk about sunny places.
So, what does a sunny place need?
Not habitat per se.
But what are the conditions that make it possible?
Or fire. Or dry soils.
And that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.
And then we can visualize this data like a network, like a social network.
And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan, and everything they needed, going back to the geology, going back to time and space at the very core of the web.
We call this the Muir Web.
And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.
Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type.
And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together.
They are the connections that actually make nature resilient.
And the structure of this is what makes nature work, seen with all its parts.
We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist John Muir, who said, "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe."
So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps.
So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th, and Lex and Third, maybe there was a stream in that block.
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there, and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses, the butterflies, the fish in the stream, the birds in the trees.
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.
And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there.
And then we took this data.
You can see this for yourself on our website.
You can zoom into any block on Manhattan, and see what might have been there 400 years ago.
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III.
We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.
And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.
So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography.
We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape.
We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities.
And feed into that the map of the species.
So that we would actually take a photograph, flying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River, waiting for Hudson to come.
Using this technology, we can make these fantastic georeferenced views.
We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.
This is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today.
This is the view looking down the Hudson River, with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right, looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
This is the view over Times Square, with the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east.
So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind.
We can see the fields that the Native Americans made.
And we can see this in the geography of the city today.
So when you're watching "Law and Order," and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond, 400 years ago.
So these images are the work of my friend and colleague, Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today.
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work.
There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.
And even though I've only had a brief time to speak, I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.
The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity.
It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.
But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right, which I quite do.
In fact, that I see them as reflections of each other, much as Lewis Carroll did in "Through the Looking Glass."
We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time, that they really are the same place, that there is no way that cities can escape from nature.
And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.
So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past, but about 400 years from now, what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people, and need to supply what people need: a sense of home, food, water, shelter, reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning.
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity.
And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning, about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways, through technology, through art, through science, so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter, and what we need to raise the kids.
So, how can we envision the city of the future?
Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park, and we imagine it without all the cars, and bicycles instead and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains?
What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs, and streams winding through the city, and windmills supplying the power we need?
Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area, currently home to 12 million people, but 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan, in only 36 percent of the area, with the areas in between covered by farmland, covered by wetlands, covered by the marshes we need.
This is the kind of future I think we need, is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan, but that learns from the sustainability of the past, of the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts.
Thank you very much.
I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.
Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage, so I decided to create my own in public places.
So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.
Now this took place in January of 2002.
And this woman is the star of the video.
She doesn't know she's being filmed.
She's being filmed with a hidden camera.
This is on the 6 train in New York City.
And this is the first stop along the line.
These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera.
And that's me right there in a brown coat.
It's about 30 degrees outside.
I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.
And the girl's going to notice me right here.
And as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants.
So at this point -- at this point she's noticed me, but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car.
One person's not that unusual.
She goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled "Rape."
So she's noticed the unusual thing, but she's gone back to her normal life.
Now in the meantime, I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well.
They're going to be entering this car one by one.
We'll act as though we don't know each other.
And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made, forgetting our pants on this cold January day.
So at this point, she decides to put the rape book away.
And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings.
Now in the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera, they're cracking up.
They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before.
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now.
And I love that moment in this video, because before it became a shared experience, it was something that was maybe a little bit scary, or something that was at least confusing to her.
And then once it became a shared experience, it was funny and something that she could laugh at.
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line.
So the video won't show everything.
This goes on for another four stops.
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.
At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train.
We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants, put them on and said, "Thank you.
That's exactly what I needed today," and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions.
Thank you.
So that's a still from the video there.
And I love that girl's reaction so much.
And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do.
And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people.
It's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.
And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.
And we've continued to do it every year.
This January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in New York -- almost every single train line in the city.
And also in 50 other cities around the world, people participated.
As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians, I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects.
So I could do more large-scale projects.
Well one day I was walking through Union Square, and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005.
And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.
And it was very peculiar, because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting, and she was very much onstage, and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.
After about 15 seconds, her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away.
So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.
So I got inspired by that.
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do.
So this project is called Look Up More. We had 70 actors dress in black.
This was completely unauthorized.
We didn't let the stores know we were coming.
And I stood in the park giving signals.
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out "Look Up More," the name of the project.
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together.
You'll see that start right here.
And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.
And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them.
So then I gave a new hand signal, which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21, and he danced.
There were several other activities.
We had people jumping up and down, people dropping to the ground.
And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt, putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement.
And because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station, there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing.
There's a better photo of it.
So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon.
The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger.
A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said, "You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around."
So I wrote this high school kid back immediately, and I said, "Yes, you are correct.
I think I'll try to do that this weekend.
Thank you."
So here's the video.
So again, this is 2005.
This is the Best Buy in New York City.
We had about 80 people show up to participate, entering one-by-one.
There was an eight year-old girl, a 10 year-old girl.
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated.
So a very diverse group of people.
And I told people, "Don't work. Don't actually do work.
The lower level employees thought it was very funny.
And in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us.
A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers.
The managers and the security guards, on the other hand, did not find it particularly funny.
You can see them in this footage.
They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.
And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911.
So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming, watch out, the cops were coming.
And you can see the cops in this footage right here.
That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.
Ultimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not, in fact, illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.
Thank you.
So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.
One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras.
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.
But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop.
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them.
I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason.
And one morning, I was riding the subway.
I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators.
So this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8:30 in the morning.
It's morning rush hour.
It's very cold outside.
People are coming in from Queens, transferring from the E train to the 6 train.
And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs.
Thank you.
So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.
He gave 2,000 high fives that day, and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick.
And that was done also without permission, although no one seemed to care.
So I'd say over the years, one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is: "These people have too much time on their hands."
And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do, and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments, but that one's always bothered me, because we don't have too much time on our hands.
The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers, they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way.
You know, every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games.
And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game, saying, "All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."
And of course they don't.
It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon, watching a football game in a stadium.
But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library.
Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park, or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical, or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.
You know, as kids, we're taught to play.
And we're never given a reason why we should play.
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing.
And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.
We don't need a reason.
As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time, then that's enough for us.
And I think, as adults, we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play.
Thank you very much.
In my previous life, I was an artist.
I still paint. I love art.
I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities, and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics, and I see part of my job today, the reason for being here, not just to campaign for my party, but for politics, and the role it can play for the better in our lives.
For 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.
We faced many challenges.
Art was part of the answer, and my name, in the very beginning, was linked with two things: demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back, and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city.
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act.
Rather, it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget I had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something.
When we painted the first building, by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade, something unimaginable happened.
There was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident, or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star.
The French E.U. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting.
He screeched that he would block the financing.
"But why?" I asked him.
"Because the colors you have ordered do not meet European standards," he replied.
"Well," I told him, "the surroundings do not meet European standards, even though this is not what we want, but we will choose the colors ourselves, because this is exactly what we want.
And if you do not let us continue with our work, I will hold a press conference here, right now, right in this road, and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era."
Then he was kind of troubled, and asked me for a compromise.
But I told him no, I'm sorry, compromise in colors is gray, and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.
So it's time for change.
The rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost.
The pride of people about their own place of living, and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal, barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.
And when colors came out everywhere, a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people.
Big noise raised up: "What is this?
What is happening?
And we made a poll, the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.
We asked people, "Do you want this action, and to have buildings painted like that?"
And then the second question was, "Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
To the first question, 63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
But to the second question, half of them that didn't like it, they wanted it to continue.
So we noticed change.
People started to drop less litter in the streets, for example, started to pay taxes, started to feel something they had forgotten, and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.
One day I remember walking along a street that had just been colored, and where we were in the process of planting trees, when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop.
They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place.
"Why did you throw away the shutters?" I asked him.
"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered.
"Safer?
Why?
They have posted more policemen here?"
"Come on, man! What policemen?
You can see it for yourself.
There are colors, streetlights, new pavement with no potholes, trees.
So it's beautiful; it's safe."
And indeed, it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected.
And this was not a misplaced feeling.
Crime did fall.
The freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city, while the barbarism of the '90s brought about a loss of hope for the city.
The paint on the walls did not feed children, nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant, but it gave hope and light, and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things, a different spirit, a different feel to our lives, and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics, we could build a better life for each other and for our country.
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks.
We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city, up to eight stories high, the tallest of them.
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.
We established a green tax, and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly.
By means of open competitions, we managed to recruit in our administration many young people, and we thus managed to build a de-politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented.
International organizations have invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years, not all of it well spent.
When I told the World Bank directors that I wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption, they did not understand me.
But people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks.
They were paying in order to skip the queue, the long queue.
The reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole, and, on the other hand, a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe.
We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks, every week, but we could not change this corrupt practice.
"I'm convinced," I told a German official with the World Bank, "that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in Germany, in a German administration, just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes, they would be bribed just the same."
It's not about genes.
It's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience.
It's about system, it's about organization.
It's also about environment and respect.
We removed the kiosks.
We built the bright new reception hall that made people, Tirana citizens, think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests.
We created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes.
We put the citizen first, and not the clerks.
Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer, and not reinventing people based on a ready-made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us.
Things have come to this point because politicians in general, but especially in our countries, let's face it, think people are stupid.
They take it for granted that, come what may, people have to follow them, while politics, more and more, fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people.
Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians, while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation.
Seen from those stairs, all politicians today seem the same, and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism.
Barack Obama won — — because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks.
He did not know each and every one of them, but with an admirable ingenuity, he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign.
I tweet. I love it.
This is politics, not from top down, but from the bottom up, and sideways, and allowing everybody's voice to be heard is exactly what we need.
Politics is not just about leaders.
It's not just about politicians and laws.
It is about how people think, how they view the world around them, how they use their time and their energy.
When people say all politicians are the same, ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush, if François Hollande is the same as Sarkozy.
They are not.
They are human beings with different views and different visions for the world.
When people say nothing can change, just stop and think what the world was like 10, 20, 50, 100 years ago.
Our world is defined by the pace of change.
We can all change the world.
I gave you a very small example of how one thing, the use of color, can make change happen.
I want to make more change as Prime Minister of my country, but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to.
President Roosevelt, he said, "Believe you can, and you are halfway there."
Efharisto and kalinihta.
For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.
So, first, a small housekeeping announcement: please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain.
So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.
It receives the least rainfall in the country, lowest rainfall.
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches, centimeters, 16 [centimeters].
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells, though there is no electricity in most of the villages.
But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps -- they are of no use in this area.
So, welcome to the Golden Desert.
Clouds seldom visit this area.
But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.
This is a new work, it's a new program.
But for the desert society this is no program; this is their life.
And they harvest rain in many ways.
So, this is the first device they use in harvesting rain.
It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].
And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment.
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.
And this is all big raised platform.
You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope.
Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly.
And the water will go where it should go.
And then it is 40 feet deep.
The waterproofing is done perfectly, better than our city contractors, because not a single drop should go waste in this.
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season.
And this is pure drinking water.
Below the surface there is hard saline water.
But now you can have this for year round.
It's two houses.
We often use a term called bylaws.
Because we are used to get written things.
But here it is unwritten by law.
And people made their house, and the water storage tanks.
These raised up platforms just like this stage.
In fact they go 15 feet deep, and collect rain water from roof, there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.
It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.
Another big one, this is of course out of the hardcore desert area.
This is near Jaipur.
This is called the Jaigarh Fort.
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.
The age is 400 years.
So, since 400 years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season.
You can calculate the price of that water.
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.
It can break sometimes.
But this 400 year old canal, which draws water, it is maintained for so many generations.
Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.
But they can be opened for TED people.
And we request them.
You can see person coming up with two canisters of water.
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters -- water level is right up to this.
It can envy many municipalities, the color, the taste, the purity of this water.
And this is what they call Zero B type of water, because it comes from the clouds, pure distilled water.
We stop for a quick commercial break, and then we come back to the traditional systems.
The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas.
That's why I said that this is a commercial break.
But we will come back, once again, to the traditional thing.
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away, soon it become like this.
In many portions, water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything.
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching, I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.
But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area, you will notice in Bikaner things like this: where the water hyacinth couldn't grow, the sand is flowing in these canals.
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.
We had full-page advertisements, some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.
They said that throw away your traditional systems, these new cement tanks will supply you piped water.
It's a dream.
And it became a dream also.
Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas.
And people started renovating their own structures.
These are all traditional water structures, which we won't be able to explain in such a short time.
But you can see that no woman is standing on those.
And they are plaiting hair.
Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.
This town was established 800 years ago.
I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there, or Delhi was there, or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.
So, this was the terminal point for silk route.
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.
None of us were able to go to Europe, but Jaisalmer was well connected to it.
And this is the 16 centimeter area.
Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas.
You won't find water in this slide.
But it is invisible.
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here.
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms.
But apart from this system, they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.
And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also.
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body.
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons.
You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.
Whether water level goes up or down, the beauty is there throughout.
Another water body, dried up, of course, during the summer period, but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.
These statues, marvelous statues, gives you an idea of water table.
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank, it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today "mass communication."
This was for mass communication.
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned, so water will be there for seven months or nine months, or 12 months.
And then they will come and worship this pond, pay respect, their gratitude.
Another small water body, called the [unclear].
It is difficult to translate in English, especially in my English.
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.
The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up.
In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up.
And perhaps they knew the future also.
It was designed some 150 years ago.
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009, there will be a TED green and blue session, so they painted it like this.
Dry water body.
Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain.
This is called kund.
We have, in English, surface water and ground water.
But this is not ground water.
You can draw ground water from any well.
But this is no ordinary well.
It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand.
And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].
And there is a gypsum belt running below it.
And it was deposited by the great mother Earth, some three million years ago.
And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water.
This is the same dry water body.
Now, you don't find any kund; they are all submerged.
But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year.
This year they have received only six centimeters.
Six centimeter of rainfall, and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city, Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.
How they maintain them?
There are three things: concept, planning, making the actual thing, and also maintaining them.
It is a structure for maintain, for centuries, by generations, without any department, without any funding, So the secret is "[unclear]," respect.
Your own thing, not personal property, my property, every time.
So, these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area.
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected.
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side.
If you climb these three, six steps you will find something very nice.
This was done in 11th century.
And you have to go further down.
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so we can say a thousand words right now, an another thousand words.
If the water table goes down, you will find new stairs.
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.
So, throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure.
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime.
Excuse me, who built these structures?
They are in front of you.
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners, the best architects.
We can say that because of them, because of their forefathers, India could get the first engineering college in 1847.
There were no English medium schools at that time, even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.
But such people, compelled to the East India Company, which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...
but not to create the engineering colleges.
But because of them, first engineering college was created in a small village, not in the town.
The last point, we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert.
So, you can find through your Jeep, a camel, and a cart.
This tire comes from the airplane.
So, look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater, and also create something through a tire from a jet plane, and used in a camel cart.
Last picture, it's a tattoo, 2,000-years-old tattoo.
They were using it on their body.
Tattoo was, at one time, a kind of a blacklisted or con thing, but now it is in thing.
You can copy this tattoo.
I have some posters of this.
The center of life is water.
These are the beautiful waves.
These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides.
These are the trees.
And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives.
So, this is the message of desert.
Thank you very much.
So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.
These artifacts and designs are inspiring.
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere, that the world can learn from this?
Or is this just right for this place?
Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area.
So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere, right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.
And these [unclear], which stored water, there are two type of things.
One recharge, and one stores.
So, it depends on the terrain.
But kund, which uses the gypsum belt, for that you have to go back to your calendar, three million years ago.
If it is there it can be done right now.
Otherwise, it can't be done.
Thank you so much.
Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something -- a movie, an album, a song or a book -- and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked, and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it, and it came back, and the person hated it?
So, by way of introduction, that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years.
I teach high school math.
I sell a product to a market that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.
I mean, it's just a losing proposition.
So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see, a useful stereotype about you all.
I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam, and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate.
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today.
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
For example, factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one.
This stuff is also really easy to relearn, provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning.
Math reasoning -- we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach.
This is what we would love students to retain, even if they don't go into mathematical fields.
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but ensures they won't retain it.
So, I'd like to talk about why that is, why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it and, to close with, why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher.
So first, five symptoms that you're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom.
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.
Students lack perseverance.
They lack retention; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.
There's an aversion to word problems, which describes 99 percent of my students.
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation.
This is really destructive.
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows, has a really good description for this.
He swore off creating contemporary drama, shows set in the present day, because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect, it shapes the neural pathways, he said, in such a way that they expect simple problems.
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."
You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes, three commercial breaks and a laugh track.
And I'll put it to all of you, what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.
I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.
I'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way.
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning and patient problem solving, it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.
In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.
It applies equally to math.
Notice, first of all here, that you have exactly three pieces of information there, each of which will figure into a formula somewhere, eventually, which the student will then compute.
I believe in real life.
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever, that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance; where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out, or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some.
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.
When it comes time to do the actual problem set, we have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from, it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.
You could literally, I mean this, pass this particular unit without knowing any physics, just knowing how to decode a textbook.
That's a shame.
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.
Here's a really cool problem.
I like this.
It's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift.
But what you have here is actually four separate layers, and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and, particularly, how when they're compressed together and presented to the student all at once, how that creates this impatient problem solving.
I'll define them here: You have the visual.
You also have the mathematical structure, talking about grids, measurements, labels, points, axes, that sort of thing.
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about: which section is the steepest.
So I hope you can see.
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer, but we're paving a smooth, straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way.
That's all we're doing here.
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students, we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.
So right here I start with the visual, and I immediately ask the question: Which section is the steepest?
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.
So you get people arguing against each other, friend versus friend, in pairs, journaling, whatever.
And then eventually we realize it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line.
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A, B, C and D labels to talk about them more easily.
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean, we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.
And then and only then, we throw down that mathematical structure.
The math serves the conversation, the conversation doesn't serve the math.
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.
But if you need to, your students can then develop those substeps together.
Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that -- which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein, who, I believe, has paid his dues.
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important, and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here, we just give problems to students; we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.
And here's how it works.
I like this question. It's about a water tank.
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.
Students have to develop those, they have to formulate those.
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.
Students need to decide, "All right, well, does the height matter?
Does the side of it matter?
Does the color of the valve matter?
What matters here?"
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.
So now we have a water tank.
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms, not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks, we go out and we take a picture of it.
So now we have the real deal.
How long will it take it to fill it up?
And then even better is we take a video, a video of someone filling it up.
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.
It's tedious.
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes, and they're all wondering at some point or another, "Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"
That's how you know you've baited the hook, right?
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me because, like the intro, I teach kids -- because of my inexperience -- I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me, so I won't talk about it.
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.
Everyone's filled something up with water before, so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation.
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses, and kids have bought in here.
And then we follow the process I've described.
And the best part here, or one of the better parts is that we don't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher's edition.
And that's terrifying, because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition, that's great, but it's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.
But those conversations have been so valuable, among the most valuable.
So I'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class.
These are the kids who now, one semester in, I can put something on the board, totally new, totally foreign, and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year, which is just so fun.
We're no longer averse to word problems, because we've redefined what a word problem is.
We're no longer intimidated by math, because we're slowly redefining what math is.
This has been a lot of fun.
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia, because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation; to let students build the problem, because Einstein said so; and to finally, in total, just be less helpful, because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways: It's buying you out of your obligation, for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap, and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying, "Wow, yeah.
We had a good conversation about that.
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better," which, wow.
I put this problem on my blog recently: In a grocery store, which line do you get into, the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom, but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later, which is just bizarre, right?
And from all of this, I can only conclude that people, not just students, are really hungry for this.
Math makes sense of the world.
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition.
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education -- whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever -- insist on better math curriculum.
We need more patient problem solvers.
Thank you.
Feminists don't have a sense of humor.
Feminists just want to be alone -- boo hoo, hoo, hoo.
Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors.
They have a tumor on their funny bone.
They say child molestation isn't funny -- ha, ha, ha, ha.
Rape and degradation's just a crime -- lighten up, ladies. Rampant prostitution's sex for money -- what's wrong with that?
Can't these chicks do anything but whine?
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
Woo-hoo!
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da -- yeah, take it off.
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, dum. They say cheap objectification isn't witty -- it's hot!
Equal work and wages worth the fight -- sing us a new one.
On-demand abortion every city -- OK, but no gun control. Won't these women ever get a life? Feminists don't have a sense of humor -- poor Hillary.
Feminists and vegetarians -- make mine a Big Mac.
Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors.
They're far too sensitive to ever be a ham, that's why these feminists just need to find a man.
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. I'm Dennis Kucinich and I approved this message.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I asked my mother, you know, should I say anything in support of anyone?
And she said, "Oh no!
Just dis everybody, except Ralph Nader."
I could show the world how to smile, I could be glad all of the while.
I could turn the gray skies to blue, if I had you.
I could leave the old days behind, leave all my pals, I'd never mind.
I could start my life all anew, if I had you.
I could climb the snow-capped mountains, sail the mighty ocean wide.
I could cross the burning desert, if I had you by my side.
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned, humble or poor, rich or renowned.
There is nothing I couldn't do, if I had you.
Thank you.
Well, thank you so much.
Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies, the really cool companies, the innovative ones, the creative, new economy-type companies -- Apple, Google, Facebook -- are coming out of one particular country, the United States of America?
Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!
But, yeah.
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.
Now what I do is I'm an economist, and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company, the industry and the nation, and I work with policymakers worldwide, especially in the European Commission, but recently also in interesting places like China, and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues: Where are the European Googles?
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model, which they understand is different from this old economy growth model?
And what is interesting is that often, even if we're in the 21st century, we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state.
It's talked about in these modern ways, but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley, the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms, the private initiative, whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies, the gazelles as we often call them, which traditional banks are scared of, or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions, their products, to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail.
But what really interests me, especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world, is the language that's used, the narrative, the discourse, the images, the actual words.
So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box.
They are more dynamic.
Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford, where he said to be innovative, you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.
Right?
So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys, right?
And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector.
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could.
And even really respectable newspapers, some that I'm actually subscribed to, the words they use are, you know, the state as this Leviathan.
Right?
This monster with big tentacles.
They're very explicit in these editorials.
They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution, but you know what, what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet?
We all hope it might be something green, or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say -- this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution -- they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?
Fund the infrastructure.
Even fund the basic research, because this is popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in, do that, but you know what?
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."
Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.
They're often called garage tinkerers, because some of them actually did some things in garages, even though that's partly a myth.
And so what I want to do with you in, oh God, only 10 minutes, is to really think again this juxtaposition, because it actually has massive, massive implications beyond innovation policy, which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers.
It has huge implications, even with this whole notion that we have on where, when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which, of course, as we know, are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition.
Right?
I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.
So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy.
And so to think again, there's no reason that you should believe me, so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.
Ask who actually funded the really cool, revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone.
What actually makes your phone a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?
So the Internet, which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world; GPS, where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world; the touchscreen display, which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone, and they're all government-funded.
And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.
The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.
So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs, whereas the slight variations of existing drugs -- Viagra, different color, different dosage -- are the less revolutionary ones.
And it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring, Kafkian public sector labs.
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.
They do.
They spend on the marketing part.
They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock, which is quite problematic.
In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R&amp;D, but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about.
Now, what's interesting in all of this is the state, in all these examples, was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.
It was actually shaping and creating markets.
It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research.
It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.
So these SBIR and SDTR programs, which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital, but also have become increasingly important.
Why?
Because, as many of us know, V.C. is actually quite short-term.
They want their returns in three to five years.
Innovation takes a much longer time than that, 15 to 20 years.
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?
Who's actually funding the hard stuff?
Of course, it's not just the state.
The private sector does a lot.
But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics, but not really providing that sort of high-risk, revolutionary thinking out of the box.
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet to doing the spending, but also the envisioning, the strategic vision, for these investments, it was actually coming within the state.
The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology, came from within government.
And so there's huge implications of this.
First of all, of course I'm not someone, this old-fashioned person, market versus state.
What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.
But the point is, by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan, I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way.
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part, the public part -- well, they're both P's -- with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking.
What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking.
Bring it on.
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafkian bureaucrat, I've met him."
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant, boring, it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way.
So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations.
DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri, actually thought really hard about this, how to welcome failure, because you will fail.
You will fail when you innovative.
One out of 10 experiments has any success.
And the V.C.
guys know this, and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success.
We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course, the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship, and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait, to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds, that whole risk-reward thing.
Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?
The Internet was crazy.
It really was.
I mean, the probability of failure was massive.
You had to be completely nuts to do it, and luckily, they were.
Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.
And the problem is that economists often think, well, there is a reward back to the state.
You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.
Well, unfortunately, that's not true.
Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.
Globalization, and that's fine.
We shouldn't be nationalistic.
Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.
I mean, one can take a position on that.
But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- Apple's a great example.
They even got the first -- well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.
And yet we know they legally, as many other companies, pay very little tax back.
So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax.
Why not?
It could happen perhaps through equity.
This, by the way, in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically, countries like Finland in Scandinavia, but also in China and Brazil, they're retaining equity in these investments.
Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money, it's a public funding agency in Finland, which then funded the next round of Nokias.
Instead, many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained.
But perhaps even more important, we heard before about the one percent, the 99 percent.
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way, as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism, because that's what we're talking about, right?
Who are the different players in creating value in the economy, and is the state's role, has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?
If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back, it might just be that in the next round, and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green, that that period of growth will not only be smart, innovation-led, not only green, but also more inclusive, so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth, because they have not.
Thank you.
There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined -- 40,000, actually.
Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history, as a matter of fact.
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington, D.C., which unfortunately is closed now, and about to be turned into Walgreen's.
And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll, on H Street in Washington.
And it's not completely gratuitous, because wok and roll -- Chinese food and Japanese foods, so it kind of works out.
And Americans love their Chinese food so much they've actually brought it into space.
NASA, for example, serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.
So, let me present the question to you: If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie, you should ask yourself, how often do you eat apple pie, versus how often do you eat Chinese food.
Right?
And if you think about it, a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese, for example: beef with broccoli, egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken, fortune cookies, chop suey, the take-out boxes.
For example, I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China, gave them to Chinese to see how they would react.
What is this?
Should I try it?
Try it!
What is it called?
Fortune cookie.
There's a piece of paper inside!
What is this?
You've won a prize!
What is this?
It's a fortune!
Tasty!
So, where are they from?
The short answer is, actually, they're from Japan.
And in Kyoto, outside, there are still small family-run bakeries that make fortune cookies, as they did over 100 years ago, 30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States.
If you see them side by side, there's yellow and brown.
Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste, so they're not as sweet as our version.
So, how did they get to the United States?
Well, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over, and a bunch of the bakers introduced them -- including at least one in Los Angeles, and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo-do, which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan.
They back then, actually, made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto.
So, the interesting question is, how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese?
Well, the short answer is, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II, including those that made fortune cookies, so that's the time when the Chinese moved in, kind of saw a market opportunity and took over.
So, fortune cookies: invented by the Japanese, popularized by the Chinese, but ultimately consumed by Americans.
They are more American than anything else.
Another one of my favorite dishes: General Tso's Chicken -- which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.
I love this dish.
The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso, and he has marched very far indeed, because he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love.
He has marched so far, actually, that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.
He's retired, deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong.
So, he -- after this I showed him, he got up, and he's like, "Mominqimiao," which means, "This is all nonsense," and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon.
So, another dish.
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable; in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s, but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.
In fact, the Chinese had their own version of broccoli, which is called Chinese broccoli, but right now, what -- they've now discovered American broccoli, and are importing it as a, sort of, exotic delicacy.
I guarantee you, General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life -- and indeed, that actually was a picture of General Tso.
I went to his home town.
This is a billboard that says: "Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso."
And I went looking for chicken.
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken.
Believe it or not, these guys were actually crossing the road.
And -- -- I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town.
This guy is now five generations removed from the General; this guy is about seven.
Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you, and they're like, we don't know this dish.
And then they're like, is this Chinese food?
Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.
But they weren't kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them, because in their eyes he is, after all, a famous Qing dynasty military hero.
He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion, which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ.
And caused the war that killed 20 million people -- still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day.
So, you know, I realized when I was there, General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America, in that he's known for chicken and not war.
But in China, this guy's actually known for war and not chicken.
But the granddaddy of all the Chinese-American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey, which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century.
And according to New York Times, in 1904, there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town, and "the city has gone 'chop suey' mad."
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized that, whoa, chop suey is actually not known in China.
And as this article points out, "The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey."
You know, back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan: if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl, you could take her out on a chop suey date.
I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another, because chop suey, if you translate into Chinese, means tsap sui, which, if you translate back, means "odds and ends."
So, these people are going around China asking for chop suey, which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying, I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called "leftovers," and it is particularly -- -- right?
And not only that: this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving.
So, why -- why and where -- did chop suey come from?
Let's go back to mid-1800s when the Chinese first came to America.
Now back then, the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.
In fact, they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien.
These people weren't eating dogs -- they were eating cats -- and they weren't eating cats -- they were eating rats.
In fact, The New York Times, my esteemed employer, in 1883 ran an article that asked, "Do Chinese eat rats?"
And not the most PC question to be asked today, but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time, not so outlandish.
This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800s, and if you see, under the word "Clears" -- very small -- it says, "They must go," which refers not only to the rats, but to the Chinese in their midst, because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us.
And another way that you saw, sort of, this sort of, this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this.
This is actually in the Library of Congress; it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers, hero of our American labor movement, and it's called, "Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion: Meat versus Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism: Which shall survive?
And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat.
And as a matter of fact, then, this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So, with sentiments like these, the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between 1882 and 1902, the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity.
So, in a way, because the Chinese were attacked, chop suey was created as a defense mechanism.
Now, who came up with the idea of chop suey?
There's a lot of different mysteries, a lot of different legends, but of the ones that I've found that I thought was most interesting is this article from 1904.
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says, I want you guys all to stop making chop suey, because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey.
And the way that he tells it, there was a guy, there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up, and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.
And as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically, the American man has become very rich.
Lem Sen, who's this guy: I would have made this money, too, but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe.
Now I've come and found him, and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey, or pay me for the right to do the same.
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights.
So the thing is, this kind of idea of Chinese-American food doesn't exist only in America.
In fact, if you think about it, Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet, served on all seven continents, even Antarctica, because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station, which is the main scientific station in Antarctica.
So, you see different varieties of Chinese food.
For example, there is French Chinese food, where they serve salt and pepper frog legs.
There is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies, so they serve fried gelato.
My downstairs neighbor, Alessandra, was completely shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."
She's like, "It's not?
But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."
And even the Brits have their own version.
This is a dish called crispy shredded beef, which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred, and not a lot of beef.
There is West Indian Chinese food, there's Jamaican Chinese food, there is Middle Eastern Chinese food, there's Mauritian Chinese food.
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered.
There's Indian Chinese food, Korean Chinese food, Japanese Chinese food, where they take the bao, the little buns, and they make them into pizza versions, and they take -- and they -- like, totally randomly they'll take Chinese noodle dishes, and they'll just Ramen-ize them.
This is, like, this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup.
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food, which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food, where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas.
And then -- one thing: they have things like risotto chop suey.
My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil, called "Kung Food."
So, let's take a step back, and kind of, understand what is to be appreciated in America.
McDonald's has, sort of, garnered a lot of attention, a lot of respect, for basically standardizing the menu, décor and dining experience in post-World War II America.
But you know what?
They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois, right?
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue, with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters.
So, this actually became very clear to me with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing, where, you know, they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had, to have three or four second-place winners -- those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers.
Instead, they had 110, and they were completely shocked.
They looked all across the country, and discovered it couldn't necessarily be fraud, because it happened, you know, in different states, across different computer systems.
So whatever it was, it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way.
So, like, OK, maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know, like, it was a diamond, or, you know, diagonal.
It wasn't that.
It wasn't that, so they're like, OK, let's look at television, so they looked at an episode of "Lost."
Now, I don't have a TV, which makes me a freak, but very productive, and -- -- and this episode of "Lost," I understand, where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number, which was how long they'd been on the island, but they looked, and the numbers did not match.
So they looked at "The Young and The Restless," and it wasn't that, either.
So, it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day, and they ask him, "Where did you get your number from?"
He's like, "Oh, I got it from a fortune cookie."
This actually is a slip that one of the winners had, because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like, oh, no -- like, this can't be true.
But it was true, and basically, of those 110 people, and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie.
Yeah. So, I went and started looking.
I went across the country, looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from.
You know, there are a bunch of them, including Lee's China in Omaha -- which is actually run by Koreans, but that's another point -- and a bunch of them named China Buffet.
So, what's interesting is that their stories were similar, but they were different.
It was lunch, it was take-out, it was sit-down, it was buffet, it was three weeks ago, it was three months ago.
But at some point, all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant, and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies, which, of course we know aren't even Chinese to begin with.
So it's kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self-organization, right, where, like in ant colonies, where little decisions made by -- on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level.
So, a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets.
McDonald's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product.
They did chicken pot pie, they did fried chicken, and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.
And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them, because that's kind of an easy concept, but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner, which is why it took so long for other people to copy them.
It took 10 years, and then within a couple of months, it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald's in the country.
In contrast, we have General Tso's Chicken, which actually started in New York City in the early 1970s, as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early 1970s, so ...
And this logo!
So me, General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related.
But that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City.
Someone's like, oh, God -- it's sweet, it's fried, it's chicken: Americans will love this.
So, what I like to say, you know, this being sort of Bay Area, Silicon Valley -- is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences.
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux: sort of an open source thing, right, where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system, that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food, you know, depending on the region.
For example, you know, in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food, where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish, right?
And in Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll, which looks like an egg roll on the outside, but a cheesesteak on the inside.
I was really surprised to discover that, not only in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta, because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to -- sorry, from Philadelphia to Atlanta, and brought that with them.
So, the thing is, our historical lore, because of the way we like narratives, are full of vast characters such as, you know, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Chandler with Coca-Cola.
But, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters -- oops -- for example, like Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey, Chef Peng, who introduced General Tso Chicken, and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies.
So, the point of my presentation is to make you think twice, that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much, if not more, impact on what we eat today.
So. Thank you very much.

What is bioenergy?
Bioenergy is not ethanol.
Bioenergy isn't global warming.
Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive.
Bioenergy is oil. It's gas. It's coal.
And part of building that bridge to the future, to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way, or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it.
And to do that, you really have to look first at agriculture.
So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years.
And in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests, you've got to deal with all types of awful things, you've got to cultivate stuff.
In the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate, then you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.
You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation makes a difference.
Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the rivers flood.
You start getting this organic agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this stuff.
Machinery, with a whole bunch of water, leads to very large-scale agriculture.
You put together machines and water, and you get landscapes that look like this.
And then you get sales that look like this.
It's brute force.
So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system.
You start taming that natural system.
You put a lot of force behind that natural system.
You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- -- behind that natural system, and you end up with systems that look like this.
And it's all brute force.
And that's the way we've been approaching energy.
So the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology.
And you move from a discipline of engineering, you move from a discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of biology.
And probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me.
This is a guy called Norman Borlaug.
He won the Nobel Prize.
He's got the Congressional Medal of Honor.
He deserves all of this stuff.
And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds.
He did this in Mexico.
The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution.
That is something that a lot of people have criticized.
But of course, those are people who don't realize that China and India, instead of having huge amounts of starving people, are exporting grains.
And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research, which was Mexico, didn't adopt this technology, ignored this technology, talked about why this technology should be thought about, but not really applied.
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn't apply technology that was discovered in Mexico.
And in fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point where there aren't statues of this man all over Mexico.
There are in China and India.
And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India.
That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies.
Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world.
It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does, if you understand biology.
What happened in agriculture?
Well, if you take agriculture over a century, agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier.
Yeah, the plows look different.
The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules, but the farmer would have understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is why he's doing it, this is where he's going.
What really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's where you get your productivity increases.
And as you do that stuff, here's what happens to productivity.
Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100 bushels, to 40, to 15, to five.
Agricultural labor productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000, whereas the rest of the economy increased about 2.5 times.
This is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person.
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.
And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced.
This would be a good outcome for energy.
And of course, by now, you're probably saying to yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology."
So where's the link between these two things?
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand.
We don't even know what oil is.
We don't know where oil comes from.
I mean, literally, it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from.
The best assumption, and one of the best guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes out of this stuff, that these things absorb sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of years, and you get these black rivers.
And if you think of bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol.
Bioenergy is taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas, concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why you get these rainbows.
And as you're looking at this system, if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then bioenergy works in a different way.
And we've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels.
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas, the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots.
This is how you farm oil.
And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started with this brute force approach.
And then what did we learn?
Then we learned we had to go bigger.
And then what'd we learn?
Then we have to go even bigger.
And we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy.
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest trucks in the world are working here, and then you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is basically oil that doesn't flow.
It's tied to the sand.
And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it, which only works at today's oil prices.
Coal.
Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants, except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure.
So you take something like this, you burn it, you put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get this.
Although, again, I stress: we don't know.
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff.
But as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat kernels look like.
Not entirely unlike coal.
And of course, coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines, you get gas.
When that gas blows up, people die.
So you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines, but not in others.
Any place you see a differential, there're some interesting questions.
There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff.
But again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying exactly the same technology.
Here's your brute force approach.
Once you get through your brute force approach, then you just rip off whole mountaintops.
And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions, which are coal-fired gas plants.
That is probably not the best use of bioenergy.
As you think of what are the alternatives to this system -- it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves, nor is China.
There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there, and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy, because if we keep treating them as chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're going to be in deep doo-doo.
Gas is a similar issue.
Gas is also a biological product.
And as you think of gas, well, you're familiar with gas.
And here's a different way of mining coal.
This is called coal bed methane.
Why is this picture interesting?
Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up -- may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.
This is a well-known phenomenon.
You eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas.
It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process.
If that is true, then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it may not be to burn coal.
It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture.
That is what bioenergy is.
It is not ethanol.
It is not subsidies to a few companies.
It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants.
It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture, from brute force into biological force.
And in the measure that you can do that, you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it pretty quickly.
We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff.
OK, if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades, you can get a really substantial increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your output.
This is just the beginning stages of this stuff.
And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who did part of the sequencing of the human genome, who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world -- has been thinking about how you structure this.
And there's a series of smart people thinking about this.
And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like, a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are trying to do is to think of, how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force?
Think of it in the following terms.
Think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.
Think of the cell as a hardware.
Think of the genes as a software.
And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable, that can become energy, that can become food, that can become fiber, that can become human beings, that can become a whole series of things, then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way.
What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading?
This is one of the gentle giants on the planet.
He's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met.
His name is Hamilton Smith.
He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.
He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such a modest guy that the day he won, his mother called him and said, "I didn't realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins.
Do you know he just won the Nobel?"
I mean, that was Mom, but anyway, this guy is just a class act.
You find him at the bench every single day, working on a pipette and building stuff.
And one of the things this guy just built are these things.
What is this?
This is the first transplant of naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell, insert it into a different cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate species.
That's one month old.
You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff.
And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are, we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies.
We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff, both in economic terms and in energy terms.
This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks.
Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur.
The difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14 bucks a barrel.
That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks.
And by the way, the scale on these things is pretty large.
Now, if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you really do start applying biological principles to energy.
This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind, to the point where you can get to solar, to the point where you can get to nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault.
Just a thought.
But in the meantime, for the next decade at least, the name of the game is hydrocarbons.
And be that oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're dealing with.
And before I make this talk too long, here's what's happening in the current energy system.
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons.
That means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff.
And there's a role in here for conservation.
There's a role in here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to get that other portion right.
How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future.
And as we think of this bridge to the future, one of the things you should ponder is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today inside those wells.
So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there.
Which, of course, requires more energy to go out and get energy.
The ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol.
It may even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and the energy output.
That is a stupid way of managing this system.
Last point, last graph. One of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices.
This is what oil prices look like, OK?
This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low.
People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for wind, or for something else, and then guess what?
The oil price goes through the floor.
That company goes out of business, and then you can bring the oil price back up.
So if I had one closing and modest suggestion, let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States.
How do you do that?
Well, let's put a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it basically says for the next 20 years, the price of oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40 bucks.
If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax it.
If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax goes away.
What does that do for entrepreneurs?
What does it do for companies?
It tells people, if you can produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or less than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a business.
But let's not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as OPEC drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening.
Thank you.
Who are we?
That is the big question.
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained, super-intelligent ape.
This could be us.
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth.
We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today.
And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times.
We're one species out of approximately, or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years.
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.
And it's important to remember that, because the bonobos are so human, and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.
It's important to remember that we evolved.
Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.
We have a common past, and we have a common future.
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today.
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.
And this is how we look for them.
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.
I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past.
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
When we find a fossil, we mark it.
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.
We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it.
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.
When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.
And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.
And these things are so exciting.
They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors.
And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother.
Not many people can say that.
But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa, it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi.
And the Rift Valley is a depression.
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin, carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.
If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried.
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface.
And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you.
OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors, because it's incredibly difficult, A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved, and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.
And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains, and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.
So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country, Kenya.
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there.
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin, which represents some 20,000 square miles.
That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.
Two million years ago at Lake Turkana, Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors, actually lived in this region.
You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north.
But, essentially, two million years ago, Homo erectus, up in the far right corner, lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there.
But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.
In fact, if you go back in time, it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.
Where did these things come from?
That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana.
But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya, essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains.
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough, fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.
And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.
But when I was 12, as I was in this picture, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died.
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here, actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.
He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller, members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.
Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out.
Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved.
And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.
Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment.
And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones, the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones, things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.
It was truly exciting.
He had a body very similar to our own, and he was on the threshold of becoming human.
Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa, and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe.
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned, from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.
But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.
But they lived only 18,000 years ago, and that is truly extraordinary to think about.
Just to put this in terms of generations, because people do find it hard to think of time, Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.
We evolved essentially from an African stock.
Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.
And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.
And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes shared the planet Earth.
The question now is, well, who are we?
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.
For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.
Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?
And what is it that really makes us us?
I think it's our collective intelligence.
It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness.
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones, we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels: we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.
And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world, from extraordinary places.
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya, we can talk to people about what we're doing.
As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us, we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet.
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time.
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.
And last year, our population grew by 80 million.
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.
You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.
But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today.
But we have to control our numbers, because we can't really hold it together as a species.
My father so appropriately put it, that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species."
Can we hold it together?
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.
We all have an African origin.
We have a common past and we share a common future.
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today.
We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?
Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.
I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.
It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and I believe this is true, especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success.
Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not everyone can do well in that environment.
While many people responded in different ways about our education system, my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building.
Why bows?
I'm not quite sure.
Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure, my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows.
If you think about it, the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times.
The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty, where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.
In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact, the government has planted mulberry trees.
The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.
The area near these walls, which nobody bothers to pay attention to, had been left free from major intervention, and this is where I first found my treasures.
As I fell deeper into bow making, I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.
When I went on school field trips, family vacations, or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes, I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.
And they would be somethings like saws, knives, sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel.
I would bring the branches home, riding buses and subways, barely holding them in my hands.
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.
Airport security.
In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust, I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape.
One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire.
Where?
The rooftop of my apartment building, a place where 96 families call home.
A customer from a department store across from my building called 911, and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned.
I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom, in the audience today: Mom, I was really sorry, and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.
My mother had to do a lot of explaining, telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson.
I also researched extensively on bows around the world.
In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow.
I also worked with many different types of wood, such as maple, yew and mulberry, and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before.
The most effective bow for me would be like this.
One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow.
Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight, which means more power.
Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage.
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.
After fixing, breaking, redesigning, mending, bending and amending, my ideal bow began to take shape, and when it was finally done, it looked like this.
I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own.
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum, and see how my bow resembles them.
Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention.
Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage.
Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me.
You see, I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near.
From this realization, I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before.
In the end, the grass is often greener on my side of the fence, although we don't realize it.
Now, I am going to show you how my bow works.
And let's see how this one works.
This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights.
A bow may function in a simple mechanism, but in order to make a good bow, a great amount of sensitivity is required.
You need to console and communicate with the wood material.
Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being, and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow.
I may be an [odd] student with unconventional interests, but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you.
My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind, where everyone is needed exactly where they are, like the fibers and the tendons in a bow, a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient.
The bow resembles me, and I resemble the bow.
Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you.
No, better yet, a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind.
Did it strike you?
Thank you.
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
You know, in a dictionary?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
How about this word?
Here, I'll show it to you.
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite, out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
It's little discrete -- that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.
And those bits are words.
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer -- besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words, like lexicographical.
Lexicographical has this great pattern: it's called a double dactyl.
And just by saying double dactyl, I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red.
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."
Right?
It's a fun word to say, and I get to say it a lot.
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.
Right?
Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary, and keep the bad words out.
But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
And for another, deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy.
And it's not very fun.
And when parts of your job are not easy or fun, you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.
I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.
But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?
Well, I blame the Queen.
Why do I blame the Queen?
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.
But secondly, I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed.
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965.
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today.
When a guy who looks like that, in that hat, is the face of modernity, you have a problem.
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
There'd be virtually no learning curve.
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!
Computers!
What about computers?
The thing about computers is, I love computers.
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.
But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
They don't change the end result.
Because what a dictionary is, is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
The design has not changed.
And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?
Online dictionaries must be different.
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
This is my favorite word, by the way.
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.
Very useful word.
So, look at that.
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.
This is flat.
Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
Right?
Those little buttons, I had them all expanded except for the date chart.
So there's not very much going on here.
There's not a lot of clickiness.
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.
And when you improve searchability, you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for, because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.
So -- -- now, when you think about this, what we have here is a ham butt problem.
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away, and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like, "This is a perfectly good piece of ham.
Why am I throwing this away?"
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."
So she calls up mom, and she says, "Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
So they call grandma, and grandma says, "My pan was too small!"
So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
We have a pan that's too small!
You know, that ham butt is delicious!
There's no reason to throw it away.
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map, they think, "This map sucks!"
When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook, they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool!
It's not in the guidebook."
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think, "This must be a bad word."
Why?
It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
So, you can't get a smaller ham.
The English language is as big as it is.
So, if you have a ham butt problem, and you're thinking about the ham butt problem, the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive: paper is the enemy of words.
How can this be?
I mean, I love books. I really love books.
Some of my best friends are books.
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.
People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"
No.
There will still be paper dictionaries.
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint, artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.
What if biologists could only study animals that made people go, "Aww." Right?
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals, and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna, and not very much about much else.
And I think this is a problem.
I think we should study all the words, because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts.
Lexicography is really more about material science.
We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression: your speeches and your writing.
And then, often people say to me, "Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"
They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts, how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"
They're just the right tools for the job.
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"
You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real.
If you love a word, use it.
That makes it real.
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
If you love a word, it becomes real.
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic, if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less about control and more about description, then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful.
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection, or the cars get confused.
Right?
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic, but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
You can ask for help!
If you ask for help, you get more done.
And we really need help.
Library of Congress: 17 million books, of which half are in English.
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it, that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.
And I find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like "un-dictionaried," for example -- in almost every book I read.
What about newspapers?
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759, 58.1 million newspaper pages.
If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it, it would be an entire other OED.
That's 500,000 more words.
I'm not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time.
There's a lot going on there.
And I'm not even talking about polysemy, which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves.
So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow, a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff, and there's one numbered definition in the OED.
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."
Do you know what that says to me?
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub.
That's a lexicographical cop out, to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."
So, we have all these words, and we really need help!
And the thing is, we could ask for help -- asking for help's not that hard.
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers, and this is more of a visual explanation.
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language, these bright spots are what we know about, and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.
If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.
And we don't even know the shape of the language.
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida, but there's no California!
We're missing California from American English.
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
So again, lexicography is not rocket science.
But even if it were, rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days.
You know?
It can't be that hard to find some words!
So, enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.
For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings.
And then, ornithologists can go and help track populations, migrations, etc.
And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
He's a director of an electroplating company.
He's found more than 140 comets.
He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite, and that's how he found them.
If we can find comets without a telescope, shouldn't we be able to find words?
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.
And the Internet is great for collecting words, because the Internet's full of collectors.
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet, but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography.
Isn't that great?
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now, but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
They show the word, but they don't show any context.
Where did it come from?
Who said it?
What newspaper was it in?
What book?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.
If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact, it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.
So a word without its source is like a cut flower.
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.
It dies too fast.
So, this whole time I've been saying, "The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because, well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
They use it synecdochically.
And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically" is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.
So I'm really sorry.
But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language, or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country -- then you're using it synecdochically.
But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
We can put in all the meanings.
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language.
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son, who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
This is what dictionaries used to look like.
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.
It wasn't really what people needed.
And the thing is, if we can put in all the words, no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad, we can really describe the language like scientists.
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing, and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.
I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials.
I brought along with me an abalone shell.
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein.
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart.
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells, like chalk.
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials, and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job.
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure, but they're formed at the nanoscale.
They're formed at the nanoscale, and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures.
So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures, like batteries and like solar cells?
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did, in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure, using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment?
So that's the vision that I've been thinking about.
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?
Or, what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so in an environmentally friendly way?
And so, going back to this abalone shell, besides being nano-structured, one thing that's fascinating, is when a male and a female abalone get together, they pass on the genetic information that says, "This is how to build an exquisite material.
Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure, using non-toxic materials."
Same with diatoms, which are shown right here, which are glasseous structures.
Every time the diatoms replicate, they give the genetic information that says, "Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano-structured.
And you can do it the same, over and over again."
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery?
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old.
But anyone who's ever had, or knows, small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms.
And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do, it's very difficult.
So when we think about future technologies, we actually think of using bacteria and virus, simple organisms.
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me?
Also, when we think about future technologies, we start with the beginning of Earth.
Basically, it took a billion years to have life on Earth.
And very rapidly, they became multi-cellular, they could replicate, they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source.
But it wasn't until about 500 million years ago -- during the Cambrian geologic time period -- that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials.
Before that, they were all soft, fluffy structures.
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment, and organisms learned how to make hard materials.
And so that's what I would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.
Now if you look at biology, there's many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you've heard about that are already nano-structured.
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale.
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV?
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?
So here are some examples: these are some natural shells.
There are natural biological materials.
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nano-structured.
There's diatoms made out of SIO2, and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation.
What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale, and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures.
Now, going back to the abalone shell, the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins.
These proteins are very negatively charged.
And they can pull calcium out of the environment, put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids, which says, "This is how to build the structure.
Here's the DNA sequence, here's the protein sequence in order to do it."
And so an interesting idea is, what if you could take any material that you wanted, or any element on the periodic table, and find its corresponding DNA sequence, then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure, but not build an abalone shell -- build something that, through nature, it has never had the opportunity to work with yet.
And so here's the periodic table.
And I absolutely love the periodic table.
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT, I have a periodic table made that says, "Welcome to MIT.
Now you're in your element."
And you flip it over, and it's the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges.
And so I give this out to thousands of people.
And I know it says MIT, and this is Caltech, but I have a couple extra if people want it.
And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT, and I really wanted to give him a periodic table.
So I stayed up at night, and I talked to my husband, "How do I give President Obama a periodic table?
What if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,' or, 'I've already memorized it'?"
And so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit.
And then afterward, I said, "Sir, I want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight."
And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass.
And so he looked at it, and he said, "Thank you.
I'll look at it periodically."
And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy, he pulled it out and said, "And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables."
So basically what I didn't tell you is that about 500 million years ago, organisms starter making materials, but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it.
It took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell.
And that's a hard sell to a graduate student.
"I have this great project -- 50 million years."
And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly.
And so we use a virus that's a non-toxic virus called M13 bacteriophage that's job is to infect bacteria.
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it.
And by doing that, it allows the virus to express random protein sequences.
And this is pretty easy biotechnology.
And you could basically do this a billion times.
And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical, but they differ from each other based on their tips, on one sequence that codes for one protein.
Now if you take all billion viruses, and you can put them in one drop of liquid, you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table.
And through a process of selection evolution, you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you'd like it to do, like grow a battery or grow a solar cell.
So basically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.
Once you find that one out of a billion, you infect it into a bacteria, and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence.
And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales.
And these viruses are long and skinny, and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries.
Now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab.
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube.
The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery.
And then it wires itself to the current collector.
And so through a process of selection evolution, we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature, basically at the bench top.
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference.
I brought it here.
You can see it in this case -- that's lighting this LED.
Now if we could scale this, you could actually use it to run your Prius, which is my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car.
But it's basically -- you can pull one out of a billion.
You can make lots of amplifications to it.
Basically, you make an amplification in the lab, and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery.
We're able to do this also with catalysis.
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water.
And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna, and you get an energy transfer across the virus.
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels.
And I brought an example with me of that today.
My students promised me it would work.
These are virus-assembled nanowires.
When you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling.
In this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out.
And basically, by controlling the genes, you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance.
The last example are solar cells.
You can also do this with solar cells.
We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device.
And what we've found is through genetic engineering, we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems.
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward.
So this is a virus-based solar cell.
Through evolution and selection, we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.
So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great, interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force, or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials, to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making.
Thank you.
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.
And at the time I was very superstitious.
So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city -- I thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks.
And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."
So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.
And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there.
And it turned out that -- I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.
But I actually walked away with a great job offer.
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.
But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it.
On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.
However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life -- of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to as "moments that take your breath away."
And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.
Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you.
I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.
What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.
So there are, of course, two different possibilities.
There's one from a consumer's point of view -- where I was happy while experiencing design.
And I'll just give you one example.
I had gotten my first Walkman.
This is 1983.
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely.
And The Police's "Synchronicity" cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects.
And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know, situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss.
Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint -- if you're happy while actually doing it.
And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?
So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy.
While, somewhat, the Spaniards ...
and, I think, particularly, the Swiss , don't seem to be doing all that well.
Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum, in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.
And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."
And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because -- well, also, with an eye on this conference.
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.
Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period -- a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.
Under "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.
This is a blue field -- it's actually an Yves Klein painting.
And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know open as much room for the un-representable -- and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.
Then, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings -- also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.
And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.
Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness.
And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization -- that's a really easy thing to do.
And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.
This is, you know, a book.
A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.
It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.
You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.
It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view.
This is, you know, the movie poster.
Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.
Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness -- and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True."
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs?
True printed his own version of these signs.
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.
So this is one.
Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.
So you're you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.
And it takes you a while until it actually -- you realize that this says something different than what it normally says.
I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.
Now, True is a real humanitarian.
He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested, so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.
And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody -- sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.
Another New York project.
This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.
You don't see the horizon.
You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.
And the room is truly something to be seen.
People's demeanor changes when they go in there.
And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there.
There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.
I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud" a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.
But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.
He's from Korea originally.
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.
And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.
And other people go and fill them in.
This one says, "Please let me die in peace."
I think that was -- the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.
This is on a musician poster, that says: "I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units and that, as a result, my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me, after which, my contract will be cancelled, and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."
I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.
Jee gets to have his project; the public gets a sweeter environment; and different public gets a place to express itself; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.
Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while: You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?
Which brought me back to my list making -- you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.
You know, one is: just working without pressure.
Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled.
Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing -- or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.
This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.
Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things where the content is actually important for me.
And being able to enjoy the end results.
And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.
And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?
And the whole thing just fell together.
So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned -- in this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" -- and we made these spreads right out of this.
So it was: "Everything I do always comes back to me."
A couple of weeks ago, a French company asked us to design five billboards for them.
Again, we could supply the content for it.
So I just picked another one.
And this was two weeks ago.
We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me, and myself -- and photographed this one.
So it's: "Trying to look good limits my life."
And then we did one more of these.
This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.
This is: "Having" -- this is the same thing; it's just, you know, photographed from the side.
This is from the front.
Then it's: "guts."
Again, it's the same thing -- "guts" is just the same room, reworked.
Then it's: "always works out."
Then it's "for," with the light on.
And it's "me."
Thank you so much.
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier.
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.
And I want to tell you that story.
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE, for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.
We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.
Craig Venter chairs that event.
And I met Professor Hawking, and he said his dream was to travel into space.
And I said, "I can't take you there, but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.
Come back down, you weigh twice as much.
You do it again and again.
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.
We set out to do this.
It took us 11 years to become operational.
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say, you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.
And he wanted to go.
We worked hard to get all the permissions.
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.
We had a press conference, we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola, give him 25 seconds of zero-g.
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
And what he said, for me, was very moving.
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center, up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.
We had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities -- who flew with us.
A few TEDsters here.
We set up a whole ER.
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.
We had everything all set in case of an emergency; God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
We took off from the shuttle landing facility, where the shuttle takes off and lands.
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero-g.
Once he was there, [we] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like.
And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.
So we did a second parabola.
And a third.
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did.
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.
And a seventh and an eighth.
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.
He was so happy.
We are living on a precious jewel, and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.
Please join us in this epic adventure.
Thank you so much.
So, people want a lot of things out of life, but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.
Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end towards which all other things aim.
According to this view, the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.
It's that we expect them to bring us happiness.
Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want.
We're richer.
We live longer.
We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.
The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically, we haven't actually gotten any happier.
Maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness, there's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself.
People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years, but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.
In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion in research on happiness.
For example, we've learned a lot about its demographics, how things like income and education, gender and marriage relate to it.
But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.
Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less, or to graduate from college instead of dropping out, but the differences in happiness tend to be small.
Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?
I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet, but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.
It certainly seems that we're going about our lives, that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about, have a big influence on our happiness, and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult, in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.
A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never been able to do before.
Called trackyourhappiness.org, it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.
How does this work?
Basically, I send people signals at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal.
The idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day, minute to minute in some cases, and try to understand how what people are doing, who they're with, what they're thinking about, and all the other factors that describe our day, how those might relate to those changes in happiness, we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness.
We've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before, over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people.
And it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group, people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s, a wide range of incomes, education levels, people who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.
They collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.
What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating, and that's mind-wandering.
As human beings, we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present.
This guy is sitting here working on his computer, and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month, wondering what he's going to have for dinner.
Maybe he's worried that he's going bald.
This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing.
It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.
And yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness.
You've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present.
"Be here now," you've probably heard a hundred times.
Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.
Maybe these people are right.
Maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing.
On the other hand, when our minds wander, they're unconstrained.
We can't change the physical reality in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.
Since we know people want to be happy, maybe when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving.
It would make a lot of sense.
In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness.
Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.
There are three questions.
The first one is a happiness question: How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad to very good?
Second, an activity question: What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV?
And finally a mind-wandering question: Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing?
People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task -- or yes -- I am thinking about something else -- and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant, neutral or unpleasant.
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.
So what did we find?
This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis, and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present, when they're not mind-wandering.
As it turns out, people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not.
Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure, on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering, but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with, at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.
Nope.
As it turns out, people are less happy when they're mind-wandering no matter what they're doing.
For example, people don't really like commuting to work very much.
It's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else.
It's amazing.
So how could this be happening?
I think part of the reason, a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things, and they are enormously less happy when they do that, our worries, our anxieties, our regrets, and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral, they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind-wandering at all.
Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant, they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind-wandering.
If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars or one dollar.
Right?
You'd never want to play.
So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps, that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.
It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.
Maybe that's what's really going on.
How could we ever disentangle these two possibilites?
Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not backward.
Right?
The cause has to come before the effect.
We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person, and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight into the causal direction.
As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later, consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.
In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind-wandering a short time later.
In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.
A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play.
Well, how often do people's minds wander?
Turns out, they wander a lot.
In fact, really a lot.
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing.
How does that depend on what people are doing?
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent — — when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth, to 50 percent when they're working, to 40 percent when they're exercising, all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at.
Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex.
But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph, and that is, basically with one exception, no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think, that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.
It pervades basically everything that we do.
In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering, a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness.
My hope is that over time, by tracking people's moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness, and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier, but happier as well.
Thank you.
This is an ambucycle.
This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency.
It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed.
You see the defibrillator. You see the equipment.
We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston.
When I was looking at these pictures, it brought me back many years to my past when I was a child.
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem.
When I was six years old, I was walking back from school on a Friday afternoon with my older brother.
We were passing by a bus stop.
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.
The bus was on fire, and many people were hurt and killed.
I remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up.
He just needed someone helping him.
We were so scared and we just ran away.
Growing up, I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives.
Maybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child.
When I was 15, I took an EMT course, and I went to volunteer on an ambulance.
For two years, I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem.
I helped many people, but whenever someone really needed help, I never got there in time. We never got there.
The traffic is so bad. The distance, and everything.
We never got there when somebody really needed us.
One day, we received a call about a seven-year-old child choking from a hot dog.
Traffic was horrific, and we were coming from the other side of town in the north part of Jerusalem.
When we got there, 20 minutes later, we started CPR on the kid.
A doctor comes in from a block away, stop us, checks the kid, and tells us to stop CPR.
That second he declared this child dead.
At that moment, I understood that this child died for nothing.
If this doctor, who lived one block away from there, would have come 20 minutes earlier, not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance, if he would have heard about it way before, he would have saved this child.
He could have run from a block away.
He could have saved this child.
I said to myself, there must be a better way.
Together with 15 of my friends -- we were all EMTs — we decided, let's protect our neighborhood, so when something like that happens again, we will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance.
So I went over to the manager of the ambulance company and I told him, "Please, whenever you have a call coming into our neighborhood, we have 15 great guys who are willing to stop everything they're doing and run and save lives.
Just alert us by beeper.
We'll buy these beepers, just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper, and we will run and save lives."
Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old. I was a kid.
And he said to me — I remember this like yesterday — he was a great guy, but he said to me, "Kid, go to school, or go open a falafel stand.
We're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures.
We're not interested in your help." And he threw me out of the room.
"I don't need your help," he said.
I was a very stubborn kid.
As you see now, I'm walking around like crazy, meshugenah.
So I decided to use the Israeli very famous technique you've probably all heard of, chutzpah.
And the next day, I went and I bought two police scanners, and I said, "The hell with you, if you don't want to give me information, I'll get the information myself."
And we did turns, who's going to listen to the radio scanners.
The next day, while I was listening to the scanners, I heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood.
I ran there by foot. I had no medical equipment.
When I got there, the 70-year-old man was lying on the floor, blood was gushing out of his neck.
He was on Coumadin.
I knew I had to stop his bleeding or else he would die.
I took off my yarmulke, because I had no medical equipment, and with a lot of pressure, I stopped his bleeding.
He was bleeding from his neck.
When the ambulance arrived 15 minutes later, I gave them over a patient who was alive.
When I went to visit him two days later, he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life.
At that moment, when I realized this is the first person I ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance, I knew this is my life's mission.
So today, 22 years later, we have United Hatzalah.
"Hatzalah" means "rescue," for all of you who don't know Hebrew.
I forgot I'm not in Israel.
So we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives, and they're spread all around, so whenever a call comes in, they just stop everything and go and run and save a life.
Our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in Israel.
I'm talking about heart attacks, I'm talking about car accidents, God forbid bomb attacks, shootings, whatever it is, even a woman 3 o'clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her.
Three minutes, we'll have a guy with his pajamas running to her house and helping her get up.
The reasons why we're so successful are because of three things.
Thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don't even know.
We're not there to replace ambulances.
We're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive.
And we save people that otherwise would not be saved.
The second reason is because of our technology.
You know, Israelis are good in technology.
Every one of us has on his phone, no matter what kind of phone, a GPS technology done by NowForce, and whenever a call comes in, the closest five volunteers get the call, and they actually get there really quick, and navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time.
And this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time.
And the third thing are these ambucycles.
These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels.
We don't transfer people, but we stabilize them, and we save their lives.
They never get stuck in traffic. They could even go on a sidewalk.
They never, literally, get stuck in traffic.
That's why we get there so fast.
A few years after I started this organization, in a Jewish community, two Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up.
They ask me to meet.
They wanted to meet with me.
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.
When Muhammad told me his personal story, how his father, 55 years old, collapsed at home, had a cardiac arrest, and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive, and he saw his father die in front of his eyes, he asked me, "Please start this in east Jerusalem."
I said to myself, I saw so much tragedy, so much hate, and it's not about saving Jews. It's not about saving Muslims.
It's not about saving Christians.
So I went ahead, full force -- — and I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem, and that's why the names United and Hatzalah match so well.
We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs.
Arabs were saving Jews.
Jews were saving Arabs.
Something special happened.
Arabs and Jews, they don't always get along together, but here in this situation, the communities, literally, it's an unbelievable situation that happened, the diversities, all of a sudden they had a common interest: Let's save lives together.
Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers.
It's an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause.
And these are all volunteers.
No one is getting money.
They're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives.
When my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest, one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father was one of these Muslim volunteers from east Jerusalem who was in the first course to join Hatzalah.
And he saved my father.
Could you imagine how I felt in that moment?
When I started this organization, I was 17 years old.
I never imagined that one day I'd be speaking at TEDMED.
I never even knew what TEDMED was then.
I don't think it existed, but I never imagined, I never imagined that it's going to go all around, it's going to spread around, and this last year we started in Panama and Brazil.
All I need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me, passionate about saving lives, and willing to do it.
And I'm actually starting it in India very soon with a friend who I met in Harvard just a while back.
Hatzalah actually started in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew years before us in Williamsburg, and now it's all over the Jewish community in New York, even Australia and Mexico and many other Jewish communities.
But it could spread everywhere.
It's very easy to adopt.
You even saw these volunteers in New York saving lives in the World Trade Center.
Last year alone, we treated in Israel 207,000 people.
Forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations.
And we made a difference.
I guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob, and it works.
When I look all around here, I see lots of people who would go an extra mile, run an extra mile to save other people, no matter who they are, no matter what religion, no matter who, where they come from.
We all want to be heroes.
We just need a good idea, motivation and lots of chutzpah, and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved.
I'd like to start with a little experiment.
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses, or you've had laser refractive surgery?
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction.
The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people.
They also have an estimate of around a billion.
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population.
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world.
There are just way too few eye care professionals.
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K.
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.
How do you do this?
How do you solve this problem?
I came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem.
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.
I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there, and I can see that guy running out there.
I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.
Next step in my process.
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... I've just ...
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.
Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.
In fact, this technology's been evolving.
I started working on it in 1985, and it's been evolving very slowly.
There are about 30,000 in use now.
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.
I have a global vision for vision.
And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.
The technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down.
This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.
You start to get into detail.
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
How do you work out how to fit the thing?
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?
How do you deal with the industry?
And the answer to that is research.
What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university.
Thank you.
Can you tell what it is?
I'm a molecular biologist by training, and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.
They're usually referred to as a model figure, a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs.
This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell.
There's a problem with this drawing, though, and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.
From lots of experiments, from lots of different scientists, we know a lot about what these molecules look like, how they move around in the cell, and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment.
So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen, we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that.
So we start outside of the cell.
Now we're looking inside.
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.
Through connections with a membrane, clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle, that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell.
Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle, making it separate from the rest of the membrane, and now clathrin is basically done with its job, and so proteins are coming in now — we've covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage.
And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again.
These processes are too small to be seen directly, even with the best microscopes, so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis.
Here's another illustration, and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.
And again, this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes.
You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses.
Why?
Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard.
I spent months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software, and I spend months on each animation, and that's just time that most researchers can't afford.
The payoffs can be huge, though.
Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.
And I'm working on a new project now called "The Science of HIV" where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail.
The animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades, data on what this virus looks like, how it's able to infect cells in our body, and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection.
Over the years, I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea, but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis.
Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study, and with the data we have now, that's just not good enough anymore.
The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas.
One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together, and in this way, animation can feed back into the research process.
I believe that animation can change biology.
It can change the way that we communicate with one another, how we explore our data and how we teach our students.
But for that change to happen, we need more researchers creating animations, and toward that end, I brought together a team of biologists, animators and programmers to create a new, free, open-source software — we call it Molecular Flipbook — that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations.
From our testing, we've found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis.
We're also building an online database where anyone can view, download and contribute their own animations.
We're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today.
We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures.
Thank you.
I'm a filmmaker.
For the last 8 years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up: Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?
Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance?
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers.
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region.
Yet, most of you have probably never heard about them.
This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful.
So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention, the power of your attention, and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere -- but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence, but for us to start paying attention to those who already are.
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus.
About seven years ago, they faced extinction, because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier, and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village.
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded, so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank.
Through inspired local leadership, they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening.
Let me show you some brief clips, so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground.
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel.
Here in Budrus, we realized the wall would steal our land.
Israeli The fence has, in fact, created a solution to terror.
Today you're invited to a peaceful march.
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition.
We saw the men trying to push the soldiers, but none of them could do that.
But I think the girls could do it.
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds of traditional thinking.
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
Chanting: One united nation.
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
They were allowed to use any force necessary.
These are live bullets.
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
Israeli A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear].
Protester: This is a peaceful march.
There is no need to use violence.
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!
We can do it!
Julia Bacha: When I first heard about the story of Budrus, I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago, in 2003.
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful.
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance, convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line, which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories.
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow, or even survive, in Palestine.
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause.
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue, it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight.
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room.
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit.
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior, since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it.
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children.
But that's true for adults too.
In fact, the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced, depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention.
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation.
In a village called Wallajeh, which sits very close to Jerusalem, the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus.
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access, either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention.
So we organized a screening.
A week later, they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date.
The organizers say that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film, felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing, that people cared.
So they kept on going.
On the Israeli side, there is a new peace movement called Solidariot, which means solidarity in Hebrew.
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools.
They report that Israelis who had never been active before, upon seeing the film, understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities.
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior.
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in, Ni'lin, Wallajeh, in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible, valued and effective in their work.
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts, they are invisible, and it's as if they never happened.
But I have seen first hand that if we do, they will multiply.
If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation.
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus.
Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere.
I'm going to give you four specific examples -- and I'm going to cover at the end -- about how a company called Silk tripled their sales by doing one thing, how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact, to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect.
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years, a record label I started that had a CD called "Sauce."
Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread, and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.
Now, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said?
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something.
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread, and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -- that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it; no one knew about it; it was a complete and total failure.
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread, no one wanted it.
That the success of sliced bread, like the success of almost everything we've been talking about at this conference, is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like -- it's about can you get your idea to spread, or not.
And I think that the way you're going to get what you want, or cause the change that you want to change, to happen, is that you've got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread.
And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual, or you're in business, or you're flying hot air balloons.
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.
That people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.
And when I talk about it I usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation, and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.
I call it the "TV-industrial complex."
The way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution.
You use the distribution you get to sell more products.
You take the profit from that to buy more ads.
And it goes around and around and around, the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.
And that model of, and we heard it yesterday, if we could only get onto the homepage of Google, if we could only figure out how to get promoted there, if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat, and tell them about what we want to do.
If we do that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.
I mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting, in a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad, over and over and over again until they bought it.
And the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.
That just over the last few years, what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to.
This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it.
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child.
Right.
I go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine.
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year.
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff -- all so I could ignore every single message.
And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem.
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have.
And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem, because I don't care.
Here's a magazine called "Hydrate."
It's 180 pages about water.
Right.
Articles about water, ads about water.
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek.
Now there are magazines about water.
New products from Coke Japan -- water salad.
OK. Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks, because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not.
I couldn't have written this better myself.
It came out four days ago -- I circled the important parts so you can see them here.
They've come out ... Arby's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold, hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.
Now, I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold, that would get you to get in your car, drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich.
Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right, when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.
The world revolves around me. Me, me, me, me, me.
My favorite person -- me.
I don't want to get email from anybody; I want to get "memail."
So consumers, and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway; I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something, or people at, you know, the New Yorker who might print your article.
Consumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care.
Part of the reason is -- they've got way more choices than they used to, and way less time.
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.
And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before.
Cows are invisible.
Cows are boring.
Who's going to stop and pull over and say -- oh, look, a cow.
Nobody.
But if the cow was purple -- isn't that a great special effect?
I could do that again if you want it.
If the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while.
I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too.
The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is: is it remarkable?
And "remarkable" is a really cool word because we think it just means neat, but it also means -- worth making a remark about.
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going.
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car, big enough to hold a mini in its trunk.
People are paying full price for both, and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common.
Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes.
It's never "The Godfather;" it's never "Citizen Kane;" it's always some third rate movie with some second rate star.
But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out.
Because it's new, because it's fresh.
Because people saw it and said -- I didn't know that was there -- and they noticed it.
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box, and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them.
The only thing they have in common is that they're different.
We're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living, we're in the fashion business.
And the thing is, people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it.
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.
How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads, or insisting on meetings with people.
But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't.
This chair -- they sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair.
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought, to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work.
This guy, Lionel Poilane, the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago, and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.
He lived in Paris.
Last year he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread.
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like "French bread."
It wasn't what they expected.
It was neat; it was remarkable; and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.
Now he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people.
That's what mass marketing is.
Smooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market.
They would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards.
It was all about going for the center.
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken, I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you.
But market to these people because they care.
These are the people who are obsessed with something.
And when you talk to them they'll listen because they like listening -- it's about them.
And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread.
It'll spread to the entire curve.
They have something I call "otaku" -- it's a great Japanese word.
It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say, drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place, because that's what they do: they get obsessed with it.
To make a product, to market an idea, to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku, is almost impossible.
Instead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares about what it is you have to say.
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.
There's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku.
That's why there's lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces, and not so many kinds of mustard.
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out.
Krispy Kreme has a strategy, and what they do is, they enter a city, they talk to the people with otaku, and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street.
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes.
Not everybody wants it but they don't care.
They want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world.
It's as loud as a 747 jet.
But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car, if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does, they go ahead and they pick this.
It's really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening, and maybe, just maybe those people tell their friends.
So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote, right, who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-hour commercial -- that's the only thing keeping his company in business -- is that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial, and then tell their friends.
Pearl Jam, 96 albums released in the last two years.
They only sell them on their website.
Those people who buy them on the website have the otaku, and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard.
It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product; they changed what it meant to build a paint product.
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site, run by two volunteers, and I can tell you they are hard graders, and they didn't get this way by advertising a lot.
They got this way by being remarkable, sometimes a little too remarkable.
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back, and you plug it into the wall.
My father has this on his desk, and he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly.
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk.
And one person at a time, the idea spreads.
These are not diamonds, not really.
They're made from "cremains."
After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem.
Oh, you like my ring?
It's my grandmother.
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry.
But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne -- you don't have to be super-outrageous to do this.
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them.
A couple of quick rules to wrap up.
The first one is: Design is free when you get to scale.
And the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them.
Number two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe.
Proctor and Gamble knows this, right?
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people.
That's risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable.
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.
Very good is boring.
Very good is average.
It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album, or you're an architect, or you have a tract on sociology.
If it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it.
So my three stories.
Silk.
Put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section.
Sales tripled. Why?
Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk -- not milk.
For the people who were there and looking at that section, it was remarkable.
They didn't triple their sales with advertising; they tripled it by doing something remarkable.
That is a remarkable piece of art.
You don't have to like it, but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable.
Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum; he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see.
Now, at countless meetings at, you know, the Portland City Council, or who knows where, they said, we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry?
Because he did something that was at the fringes.
And my big failure?
I came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD format -- this remarkable new format -- and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos.
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don't like new music.
So what you need to do is figure out who does care.
Who is going to raise their hand and say, "I want to hear what you're doing next," and sell something to them.
The last example I want to give you.
This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.
As you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it.
But they do have a lake.
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake.
They don't anymore.
So the founding fathers said, "We've got some money to spend.
What can we build here?" And like most committees, they were going to build something pretty safe.
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist's rendering -- he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town.
That's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing.
I don't know about you but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.
Thank you very much for your attention.
As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future, and where we might move forward from this point.
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.
But I want to tell you a different story here today.
Like all stories, it has a beginning.
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education, in teaching people practical skills for sustainability, teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food, how to build buildings using local materials, how to generate their own energy, and so on.
I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland, and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model, and moderating what comes in at one end, and moderating the outputs at the other end.
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly.
And in order to introduce you to that, I've got something here that I'm going to unveil, which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.
And it's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.
This is a liter of oil.
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials, medicine, modern clothing, laptops, a whole range of different things.
It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.
We've based the design of our settlements, our business models, our transport plans, even the idea of economic growth, some would argue, on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.
Yet, when we take a step back, and look over the span of history, at what we might call the petroleum interval, it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material, and then based a whole way of life around it.
And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever.
For every four barrels of oil that we consume, we only discover one.
And that gap continues to widen.
There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it.
Completely unprecedented, historically.
Already that's fallen to about 11.
And that's why, now, the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta, or at the bottom of the oceans.
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.
The moment when the world on average passes this peak, people wonder when that's going to happen.
And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high.
But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are.
There is also the issue of climate change, is the other thing that underpins this transition approach.
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists, is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes, as the data that's coming in, which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.
So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.
Actually, if current trends continue, it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.
But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us.
"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain, that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."
And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels, and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy, or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots": the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on, with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles, a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot, where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words, this pot would just make as much food as you liked, without you having to do any work, provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.
Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.
There is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."
The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and all the shoes are magically made for them.
It's something that was unimaginable to people then.
Now we have the seven-league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.
We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco.
And we have the elves in the form of China.
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been.
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now, as we look forward about where we're going to go.
And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual, that the future will be like the present, just more of it.
But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question.
There is the idea of hitting the wall, that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse.
This is a popular story in some places.
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything, that technology can somehow get us through this completely.
But the world isn't Second Life.
We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.
And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other, there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals to make all of those things.
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances, usually at the expense of the local, more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past, which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative.
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.
Energy and technology are not the same thing.
What I'm involved with is the transition response.
And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need.
It's something which has spread incredibly fast.
And it is something which has several characteristics.
It's viral.
It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it.
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this; people just pick up an idea and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.
It's very much looking at what people can do where they are, to respond to this.
It's sensitive to place and to scale.
Transitional is completely different.
Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here, what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.
It learns very much from its mistakes.
And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary.
And it's a process which is really joyful.
People have a huge amount of fun doing this, reconnecting with other people as they do it.
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.
And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.
When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.
And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.
Looking through the lens of resilience, we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable.
Resilience runs much deeper: it's about building modularity into what we do, building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association, in 1897.
This is at a time when the city of Bristol, which is quite close to here, was surrounded by commercial market gardens, which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.
There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time, which we can now only look back on with envy.
So how does this transition idea work?
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.
They pick up some of the tools that we've developed.
They start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town.
They show films, they give talks, and so on.
It's a process which is playful and creative and informative.
Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this, and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable.
So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland, where I was teaching, and has since spread.
There are now over 200 formal transition projects.
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea, but what do they actually do on the ground?
Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.
We need national responses. We need local government responses.
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies, community-owned energy companies, where the community can invest money into itself, to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.
A lot of places are working with their local schools.
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food.
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.
This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.
Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on.
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody?
As a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.
From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world.
We're getting a lot of interest from government.
Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener.
Which he did -- -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.
There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities, Leicestershire and Somerset.
And the head of the council said, "If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time."
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.
In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this.
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now, but that things are already inevitably changing, and what we need to do is to work creatively with that, based on asking the right questions.
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories.
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company.
And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden.
So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?
Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil.
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.
But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point.
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other.
Thank you very much.
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper, The Guardian, not that long ago.
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for 15 years, worked on four continents, and you're looking at her.
And I am now going to argue that this is only half true.
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm in public health, and if you put your public health nerd glasses on, you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them, if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information, and a little bit of motivation, people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives.
Wonderful.
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV, and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality, and if you were at TED '07 it's about coffee prices ...
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction.
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.
We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail, and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues.
And so everyone lined up, all the smackheads in a row, and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit, and he went down and started injecting people.
So he injects the first guy, and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt, and he injects the next guy.
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line, and I can see the needle coming down towards me, and there is blood all over the place.
It's getting blunter and blunter.
And a small part of my brain is thinking, 'That is so gross and really dangerous,' but most of my brain is thinking, 'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me.
Please let there be some left.'"
And then, telling me this story, Frankie said, "You know ... God, drugs really make you stupid."
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.
But, actually, Frankie, at that time, was a heroin addict and he was in jail.
And if there's one place you really want to get high, it's when you're in jail.
But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes, so let's look at some data.
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that?"
"Oh yeah."
"So are you carrying a needle?"
We're actually interviewing people on the street, in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10, and the other nine in 10 are sharing.
So you've got this massive mismatch; everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV, but they're all sharing anyway.
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.
There's just kind of an ick factor there.
"No, no.
We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."
So, in Indonesia at this time, if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up, they could put you into jail.
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?
And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV, they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway.
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles.
Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.
This is a really easy problem.
For once, your incentives are aligned.
We've got what's rational for public health.
You want people to use clean needles -- and junkies want to use clean needles.
So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest.
Now, the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher.
And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program, and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.
And in all of those countries, you can see, not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV.
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example, Moscow, Jakarta -- we're talking, at its peak, one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease.
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies.
She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service.
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention, she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on, and obviously those are much higher.
So she was making a politically rational decision.
Now, if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data, it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?
But in this country, where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens, we've taken a very different approach.
So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States, and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective -- you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up, but no -- that's the whole slide.
There is nothing on the other side.
So, completely irrational, you would think.
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too, and they're responding to what they think the voters want.
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this.
Now let's talk about sex.
Are we any more rational about sex?
Well, I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church, who think somehow that if you give out condoms, everyone's going to run out and have sex.
I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online, but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict -- I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid.
It's not that easy!
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.
Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually.
So, it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids.
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected, then you start making antibodies, and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -- 10 or 12 years -- you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
But basically, nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS, and by that stage, you're not looking great, you're not feeling great, you're not having that much sex.
So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia.
Now, this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups, and that's considered stigmatizing.
The truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time.
And those groups are, globally, people who sell sex and their more regular partners.
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy, and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.
These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven, and one in three of all adults, are infected with HIV.
Now, in the rest of the world, we've got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very, very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk: drug injectors, sex workers and gay men.
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles: 25 percent prevalence among gay men.
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person.
In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries.
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.
What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI.
No one wants it.
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.
So essentially, you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.
But in "intimate" relations it's much more difficult because, with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things, we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy, and nothing is quite so unromantic as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.
So in the face of that, you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms.
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now, but he is a reminder in the population, of why you might want to be using condoms.
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making.
So, what we've got -- some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much because, actually, treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."
So, if you look at the viremia thing again, if you do start treatment when you're sick, well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes -- which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy, or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs, or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever -- all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.
Of course not, of course not.
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need.
That's simply not necessarily true, and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now.
And what we've seen is that, actually, condom use rates, which were very, very high -- the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV, with extremely little help from public health nerds, I would say -- that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really: One is the assumption of, "Oh well, if he's infected, he's probably on meds, and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you, and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day.
And that's boring, but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex, no matter how drunk you are, no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?
If we look at the data, we can see that the answer to that question is, mmm.
So these are data from Scotland.
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program.
Then it came way down.
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users, you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins, and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier.
But in gay men, you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available.
This is of new infections.
What does that mean?
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer, healthier lives, more likely to be getting laid with HIV -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load, and that's a very worrisome thing.
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days, and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers, unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.
But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims, we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view.
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.
Well, of course, because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia: on average, 20 cents.
It varies a bit province to province.
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.
Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."
So, from the point of view of a sex worker, politicians are making no sense.
From the point of view of a public health nerd, junkies are doing dumb things.
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet, and that's one of the glories of human existence.
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another, so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician, and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want.
But here's the thing: we are the voters.
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.
And everyone who's in this room, and everyone who's watching this out there on the web, I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense.
It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there, but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV.
Thank you.
In the last 50 years, we've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences.
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia.
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots, I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing, especially retail, sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places.
And in the process, what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost, and have the infrastructure in place, instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges.
So why is this important?
I think there are any number of reasons, and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.
Just from the perspective of climate change, the average urban dweller in the U.S.
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller, mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more, and living in detached buildings, you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of.
So strictly from a climate change perspective, the cities are already relatively green.
The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs.
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs, we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.
It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency.
We're just driving so much more; we haven't been able to keep up technologically.
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting.
Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles.
And those have been linked then with the rather alarming, growing rates of obesity, shown in these maps here, and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes.
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore, again, because of our development patterns.
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.
But increasingly, the savings promised by drive-till-you-qualify affordability -- which is basically our model -- those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs.
For instance, here in Atlanta, about half of households make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year, and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation.
I mean, that's 2005 figures.
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
You know, none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs, and they're not going down any time soon.
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips, there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.
But is it practical?
I think it is.
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade, and we've found over 80 varied projects.
But that they're really all market driven, and what's driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts.
We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place, but that's really not the case anymore.
Since 2000, already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them.
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.
The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now: the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap, Generation X, which is a small generation.
They're still having kids -- but Generation Y hasn't even started hitting child-rearing age.
They're the other big generation.
So as a result of that, demographers predict that through 2025, 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them.
And the market research, consumer research, asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like, what they would like to live in, tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we're already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia.
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place, and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle, but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.
The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt.
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band, but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots -- and suburbia is full of them.
When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown, it made sense to just build surface parking lots.
But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again, as we've just continued to sprawl, and they now have a relatively central location.
It no longer just makes sense.
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.
It turns out, all sorts of things.
In a slow economy like ours, re-inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies.
So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that's been re-inhabited as art-space.
It's now home to artist studios, theater groups, dance troupes.
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was, but it's serving its community.
It's keeping the lights on.
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.
Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes, as universities, and as all variety of office space.
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools, lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one.
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store, that is now a public library.
In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse, they tore up some of the parking spaces, put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff, put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods.
And they've made this, what was just a store along a commercial strip, into a community gathering space.
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix, Arizona.
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint, a gourmet grocery, and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination.
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.
The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim, "Walking distance to Le Grande Orange," because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call "a third place."
If home is the first place and work is the second place, the third place is where you go to hang out and build community.
And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family, the family households, there's a real hunger for more third places.
So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category, the next strategy: redevelopment.
Now, during the boom, there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density, a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.
But some of them have been much more incremental.
This is Mashpee Commons, the oldest retrofit that we've found.
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years, built urbanism on top of its parking lots.
So the black and white photo shows the simple 60's strip shopping center.
And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact, mixed-use New England village, and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side.
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.
Sometimes, it's all at once.
This is another infill project on the parking lots, this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville.
By 1980, it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right.
Today, the transit, the Main Street and the new housing have all been built.
Eventually, I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.
Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped.
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.
So here's what it looks like.
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street.
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction.
There's massive P.V.
arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines.
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock.
It's now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets, two public parks, eight bus lines and a range of housing types, and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had.
Here was the mall in its heyday.
They had their prom in the mall.
They loved their mall.
So here's the site in 1975 with the mall.
By 1995, the mall has died.
The department store has been kept -- and we found this was true in many cases.
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.
They're easy to be re-adapted.
But the one story stuff ...
that's really history.
So here it is at projected build-out.
It's providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle.
'We've been trying to wake him for half an hour,'said Fritz.
'But he's sleeping like a dead man.'
When l asked Wemmick if he could advise me on how to help a friend start up in business,his post-box mouth opened wide.
Next morning, there was no wind and we were half a mile from the eastern coast of the island.Although the sun shone bright and hot, I hated the thought of Treasure Is－land ,afraid of what would happen there.
The professors realized that I was doing very important work, and so they gave me my own laboratory.
There was a small flat above the laboratory, where I lived, and sometimes I stayed inside the building for a week and did not go out.
'I think,Marner,'he said firmly,'that you should consider what's best for Eppie.You shouldn't stand in her way,when she could have a better life.I'm sorry,but I think it's my duty to take care of my own daughter.'
"The plot would be the main character trying to figure out the Big Secret.
Great.
Small talk before bed.
But I removed my retainer.
"I'm named after a quality women's college."
'But…'I cried,'that's not right!I only want to help Lilliput!'
'One in ten thousand,' Perrault said to himself.
Henry always looked at the black side of everything.
He was right!We called and shouted and sailed our little boat as fast as we could.
But the ship did not see us.
Then I re-membered the guns which made a lot of smoke.
A few minutes later the ship saw us and turned.
It's Herbert!
she cried.
'I'm going to open the door for him.'
'What! 'he cried,thinking her mind was disturbed.
'To talk of many things：
'All right, 'she said in the end, 'I agree.
The poor child can stay.
I'll look after her. '
'Sure,'said O'Brien,putting another bag of gold next to Matthewson's.
I could not say I remembered him,as he was now a fine young man with a black moustache and a deep voice.But I was sure he knew me, and that he was Joe Green, and I was very glad.I put my nose up to him and tried to say that we were friends.I never saw a man so pleased.
"And since you overslept, we'll be taking the evening flight."
'Well, I'll try to get something with the gold,'Anthea said. '
We need a horse and cart.
Come on. '
It was a letter to cheer them up, and the special message for the girls came at the end： Give them all my love and a kiss.I think of them every day.I know they will be loving childrento you,and that when I come back,I will be prouder than ever of my little women.
'I'm very sorry,'he said to me. 'It's very rude of me. But I'm in a dangerous corner and you looked like the kind of man who would understand.
If I explain,will you help me?'
That moment was one of the worst moments of my life.I had no time to do anything.My friends fell on me angrily,lit the candles again,and searched my clothes.They found the single cards hidden carefully inside my left sleeve,and in my pockets they discovered the packets of special cards which helped me to win every game I played.
'I only wanted to look at the garden,your Majesty,from the top of that hill,'she began.
'I'm sorry,Miss Cathy,I think it's much worse,'I answered.
"Actually, you can help telling me everything you know about GG.
Every single detail.
For example, how and when did you meet her? At MCT? Did you ever take one of her ESL classes? Have you ever heard her say anything odd or mysterious?
Would your dad be familiar with her story? What about Renjiro? Have you ever discussed—"
'The old fool has been drinking too much again!' said Uriah,looking uglier than ever.'
You can't believe anything he says!And you've bribed my assistant,I suppose,to speak against me!'
Suddenly he gave a cry and Mrs White and Herbert ran to him.
'Now remember yourpromise.
'Jennet Device is here,' a voice said quietly.
It was Mr Nowell.
'She can tell us the truth about her mother.'
I told him my story and he listened in silence Then he said,'It's you that saves our lives,Jim,and now we'll save yours.Silver!
'he called,then as the cook came nearer,said,'Some Advice----don't hurry to find that treasure.If you do,watch out for storms.'

You'll see.Oh yes.People won't forget William Shakespeare.In 400 years'time,the theatres will still be full.People will still laugh,and cry,over his plays.He was the finest poet that ever wrote in the English language.I think he knew that himself.There's some lines in one of his sonnets,I remember…
We live in sad times now;the Puritans cut King Charles's head off last January.But one day we'll have a king again.Then there'll be singing and dancing and plays.
In this way I encouraged Heathcliff to have more confidence in himself.
But when the Earnshaws and the Lintons arrived back from church,the first thing Hindley did was shout at Heathcliff.
Tess could not accept her mother's view of life,but perhaps Joan was right in this.Silence seemed best for Angel's happiness.So she grew calm,and from October onwards she was completely happy.Clare seemed the perfect guide, thinker,and friend.She saw perfection in his face,his intelligence, and his soul.She dismissed the past from her mind.
They spent all their time together,as country people do once they are engaged.In the wonderful autumn afternoons they walked by streams,crossing on little wooden bridges.
They saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges, and at the same time bright sunshine in the fields.The sun was so near the ground that the shadows of Clare and Tess stretched a quarter of a mile ahead of them,like two long pointing fingers.When Clare talked to Tess of their future, and the farm they would have abroad,she could hardly believe that she would be going through the world by his side.Her feeling for him was now the breath and life of Tess's being.It 152 made her forget her past sorrows,but she knew they were waiting like wolves for their moment to attack.
'Ah!'
said the servant,looking unnaturally pleased aboutit,' Mr Hyde's in trouble!What's he done?'
Suddenly the old woman stopped because she saw the stranger's face.
Then the two old people knew. Their son was dead!
'Den't worry,I can take care of myself.I'm in more danger while Mason's in England.I live in constant fear of a disaster.'
'Yes, I'm almost sorry we've decided to stay on the boat,'Harris said.Then we were silent for a time.
'You go on talking, 'he answered. 'I like listening to you. '
For twelve days the wind and the rain didn't stop.
We lost three men in the sea,and soon the ship had holes in its sides.
'We're all going to die this time,'I said to myself.
Then one morning one of the sailors saw land,but the next minute our ship hit some sand just under the sea.
The sea was trying to break the ship into pieces,and we had very little time.
Quickly,we put a boat into the sea and got off the ship.
But the sea was very rough and our little boat could not live for long in that wild water.
'Er… well, yes, it is.
Sarah Mary Williams.
'What! 'I shouted.The little boy fell off my stomach and began screaming.
I picked him up and kissed him until the screaming changed to crying.I said,'Another robot animal?'
'Ellen,how is Edgar?Is he dying,as the villagers say?'
'If you don't mind,sir.'
I drove to the east through a country at peace;but I knew that in a month's time,unless I was very lucky,men would be lying dead in this quiet countryside.
I came into a village and I saw a policeman standing outside the Post Office and reading something carefully.
He looked up at the car,stepped into the road,and held up a hand to stop me.
One evening she was in the cottage as usual when there was a knock at the door.A tall thin girl came in and Tess recognized her young sister Liza－Lu.
At nine o'clock the next morning I heard Joe's clumsy boots on the stairs, and at last he entered Herbert's rooms.
We found the hammer for him,but then he lost the place on the wall where he was going to put the picture.So each one of us had to get up on the chair and look for the place.And each one of us thought that it was a different place.Then Uncle Podger tried again himself.This time he fell off the chair on to the piano.His head and his body hit the piano at the same time.The music was beautiful,but Uncle Podger's words were not!Aunt Maria was not pleased.She said that she did not want the children to listen to those terrible words.She added calmly,'The next time that you are going to put a picture on the wall,please tell me.Then I can arrange to go and spend a week with my mother.'
"You?
Shave?"
I asked as I walked out.
But the family were often sad, and I wished I could make them happy.I looked forward to the time when I could speak well enough to talk to them.
And I was happy because I was sure I would soon have three good friends.
'Does he have a sword cut on his face?
'he asked.
'Don't,Tess,don't argue.Those are just country people's ways.There is a correct way of doing things.I think that parson who discovered you were a d'Urberville should have kept quiet.Perhaps you were weak and could not refuse this man because your ancient noble blood has run thin,because your family is no good any more.I thought you were a child of nature,but you have the worst of your ancient family in you!'
'We must follow him and find out what he is doing,'said Sir Henry.
'He won't hear us if we move carefully.'
'Yes.I never really doubted—never!'
5 A lesson for Mr Toad
As if I'd ever wear matching rice bag skirts!
'They could,'he said.
'But we want to avoid that.
It would be very difficult,and some changes would be impossible.
But the big problem is that they're not going to steal the plans in the street.
They'll try to get the details without anybody knowing,and Royer will return to Paris thinking that every-thing is still secret. '
'Take them!
'he shouted.
'I never want to see them again!'
He had many visits from the Queen, and at Christmas she sent him a Christmas card.
'Yes, it is,'I replied.
'It's different for me,'his face said.
'You like it,but I don't!There's nothing for me to do.I don't smoke.I don't like looking at the trees and the flowers,and when I'm asleep you'll play about with the boat and I'll fall over the side!'
The well－dressed stranger came into the little living－room and Mr White stood up.
"All right,I'll do as you wish—for your sake."
Oh!He was a hard,clever,mean old man,Scrooge was!
There was nothing warm or open about him.He lived a secretive,lonely life,and took no interest in other people at all.The cold inside him made his eyes red,and his thin lips blue,and his voice high and cross.It put white frost on his old head,his eyebrows and his chin.The frost in his heart made the air around him cold,too.In the hottest days of summer his office was as cold as ice,and it was just as cold in winter.
At one o'clock the door opened and two men came out.They got in the cab without a word,and told Jerry where to drive.It was three kilometres away,and when the men got out they didn't say they were sorry for the long wait,but they were angry when Jerry made them pay for the extra waiting time.But it was money hard-earned.
' So am I,'said Joe.
For a moment the King said nothing,but then he asked,'Captain…Fritz…who is this?'
'What!
'cried Monks.
Mr Spenlow appeared to agree, but rather sadly.
It was a terrible afternoon.
They had no lunch, no tea, and they were tired, angry and afraid.
It's true that they were all very beautiful,but that's not a lot of help when you'rs unhappy.
In the end they fell asleep.
'What has happened?
'said Jo.
'George Jackson,'I answered quickly. 'I've fallen off a river boat.'
Cunningham had spent an agreeable week in the country with his friend Van Cheele.
Now Van Cheele was driving his guest back to the station.
Cunningham was unusually quiet on the journey, but Van Cheele talked all the time, so he did not notice his friend's silence.
'I have to admit that I liked Mr Bingley,'continued Jane in her gentle voice. 'He's so good-mannered and agreeable!'
I gave him the box.He took it with trembling hands.'
Atlast!
'he cried.He turned to me.His face was deathly pale.
'Have you a medicine glass?
'he asked.
'Come on, my lord,'I said to Bothwell.
'Our army is bet－ter than theirs—let's fight them!'
Mr Spenlow had seemed a very rich man to me, but when he died the lawyers discovered that Dora would not inherit much from him after all, as there were many debts to pay.
So I did not feel worried that anyone would suspect me of marrying Dora for her money.
Mr Spenlow's firm lost a lot of business after his death, and I realized I would have to find another profession.
I had always been good at writing, so I continued as secretary to Dr Strong, and also began reporting what was said in parliament, for the daily newspapers.
I even wrote some stories, which were published in magazines, and was very pleased with the money I was earning.
But that was not all.
Sophie and Felix loved each other, and Sophie's father had promised that they could marry.Then,when he learnt that Felix had lost all his money, he broke his promise.
But Sophie loved Felix very much,so she took some money and escaped from her father to search for Felix.
The Opera House was famous, and the directors of the Opera House were very important men.It was the first week of work for the two new directors, Monsieur Ar mand Moncharmin and Monsieur Firmin Richard.In the direc tors' office the next day,the two men talked about Joseph Bu quet.
In O liver's dream the other man answered. 'Of course it is! I told you I'd seen him.
I'd recognize him anywhere.
If I walked across his unmarked grave, I'd know it was him buried under the ground. '
It was nearly midnight.In their warm living-room, the two old people and their son sat and talked about the soldier's stories.
The guards moved behind Kiah and Rilla,and Bel began to laugh.'Goodbye!
'You're not going to the Moon,you're going to prison!You can talk about the holes in the AOL there!'
'Let me ask you something,'said the lawyer. 'Sir DanversCarew was my client, but you are my client too,and I want toknow what I'm doing.You haven't tried to hide the murderer, have you?'
Alice looked round quickly,and saw that it was the Red Queen.
'She's grown a lot,'Alice thought.When she had seen her by the fireplace,the Queen had been only eight cen-timetres high.Now she was taller than Alice herself!
When Fagin left her, Nancy was already back in a drunken sleep, her head lying on the table once more.
Fagin went out into the blackness of the night and walked home.
He had reached the corner of his street and was searching in his pocket for his key, when a dark figure came out of the shadows and crossed the road towards him.
'Jesus, man, how dirty you are! 'I said.
'Don't come near me with those hands.'
'One of us.'

But when Dorian arrived and told the story of his love,Basil became a little happier.
'You're right,'he told Dorian.
'The woman that you love must be wonderful.I can see already that she's changed you.'
I've no teeth now,and my hair has all fallen out,but I can still think—and remember.I remember when Will and I were young,just boys really…
"That must refer to the birthday collage she sent me last year."
'But you gave your grandfather the idea,didn't you, Mr Laurence?
'No,'I replied firmly.
'I'm not worried about that,because I love you.But last night I had a strange dream,a terrible dream!It was dark and windy outside,and before I went to sleep I could hear a dog growling in the distance.In my dream I was carrying a small child in my arms down a long road.I was trying to catch up with you,but I couldn't. '
Edinburgh was full of noise and traffic and people, but I did not notice any of that.
All the time I was thinking of Alan on the hill, and there was an ice-cold feeling inside me.
Arobot can do many different things from taking care of a baby to building a spaceship.It can do anything except think.The Star Zoo computer was the only one that could think.
Jakes was whipping me a third time when a woman hurried over and said,'Oh,please don't whip your horse like that.
I think I can help,if you'll let me.'
Troy closed the watch immediately and replied carelessly,'Why,yours of course.
I'd quite forgotten I had it. '
'Thank you,'said Mr Brooke,cheering up immediately.
Day after day I watched the three people.I saw how kind they were to each other.
I wanted so much to go into the house and be with them, but I knew I must stay in the hut.
I could not forget how the village people had hurt me when I tried to go into the house there.
"Watch out—you'll tarnish it," said Amber.
The two men read the letter again.It wasn't very long.
'No,miss,but he's been arguing with Mr Laurie.'
As I thought these things,I looked up at the window.
Suddenly,in the moonlight,I saw the monster's awful face looking at me.And in his yellow eyes I could see only hate and evil.I knew he would not keep his promise.
'If you remember, 'he said, and Darnay wrote, 'the words we spoke so long ago, you will understand this when you see it.
'As he said this, Carton took his hand from his pocket.
'What is that in your hand?
'asked Darnay.
'Do you ever think at all? 'asked the Rose,unkindly.
'Oh,I can't explain,'said Basil.
'When I like people a lot,I never tell their names to my other friends.I love secrets,that's all.'
'How foolish of you!Some important business made me change my plans.
I'm on my way to Bath.
I may visit Liddy at her sister's later.
I arrived home during the night,so I didn't wake Maryann up. I Just took the horse and cart myself.
Thank you for taking all this trouble,but it wasn't necessary.
Rickety buses crammed full of people. Monkeys in palm trees. Smoke from rubbish fires in fields. Roadside stands selling mounds of prickly skinned red fruit.
'Stop!
'I cried desperately.
A lawyer began to ask him questions.At first it was easy.John explained how long he had worked for the company,and how much paint the factory produced.Then the lawyer asked about the waste products.
"We're gonna LIM and love it!"
'Mother!
'Tess ran across to Joan and put her head on Joan's shoulder. 'You told me I mustn't tell him.But I did-I couldn't help it—and he went away!'
He did not reply immediately, and I was a little embarrassed by his silence.I had assumed he would still want me to be his wife, and wondered why he did not ask me.
Kiah and Rilla left the room,and walked slowly downstairs.The Ship was dark and quiet.It was eight o'clock and every-body was at dinner.
'My brother would certainly have been happi er if he hadn't married her,because I consider poor dear Clara was,in fact,just a child.'
'That's true of many people,'I said, interested.
'Dead!Killea!
'screamed the man.
'He can break it out,and start it,and pull it a hundred metres,said Thornton.
Next morning she looked anxiously at him,but he kissed her as usual.He said nothing about the letter.Had he read it?
Did he forgive her?
Every morning and night he was the same, until finally the wedding day came.
The others all shook their heads.Nobody asked me.When the handcuffs were ready,Joe suggested we should go with the soldiers,and as Mrs Joe was curious to know what happened,she agreed.So Joe,Mr wopsle and I walked behind the men through the village and out on to the marshes.
'I would like your opinion about that,'replied the lawyer.
'I have a letter from the murderer here.'
Suddenly Sapt stopped.'Listen!
'Horses behind us!Quick!Get down!The castle's to the left,'he continued.
'Our road's to the right.'
'Why don't you read the note, sir?asked the servant.
'Yes, Abraham.'
'We're speaking of music,madam,'he said,when no longer able to avoid a reply.
I stopped in town only to ask about Miss Havisham. She was still very ill, it seemed.Then I walked fast on to the dark lonely marshes.Soon I arrived at the lime-kiln, which was still burning,although the workmen had all gone home.I pushed open the door of the old house, which I thought was uninhabited,but to my surprise there was a bed, a table and a candle inside Suddenly the candle was blown out,I was at-tacked from behind and my arms were tied close to my sides with a thick rope.The pain in my injured arm was terrible.In a moment the candle was lit again,and I recognized my at-tacker.Orlick!I saw he had been drinking,and I knew I was in a very dangerous situation.
It was very tiring work,and it kept me busy so that I did not look up and see the Hispaniola until she was just half a mile away from me!But something strange was happening to her.First the ship turned north,then suddenly to the west a-gain.
Mary read the results carefully.She didn't like this kind of experiment,but she knew it was necessary.
And John was right;no rats had died,and not very many were ill.
'My dear aunt,Jane and I both know that he has neither honesty nor honour.He has falsely accused Mr Darcy, and has lied wickedly about the whole Darcy family.You saw what a shy,gentle girl Miss Darcy.is,but he had described her as proud,disagreeable and disdainful.'
'It's—it's a very fine day,'said a worried voice in her ear.Alice saw that the White Rabbit was by her side.
I can never lose you,my gallant one.I haveonly to remember the laughter we shared,the dayswe spent together,the inspiration of your struggle against pain,the spirit with which you met life,andI am enriched and enobled.Now I know that I cannever lose you because I have remembered youwith love,and you will abide with me to the end of my days.
There was one letter that helped me more thanmost.It came from an editor whom you never met.She told me something which has been a kind ofbulwark,for she said,"No one truly dies who isremembered with love."
Just then Nancy's older sister Priscilla arrived.She was a large,cheerful girl,with a round face and a nose pink with cold.As they were changing their clothes,Priscilla said to Mrs Osgood,'Look at our dresses,aunt!Of course Nancy looks beautiful in hers,but this colour makes me look yellow!
Nan－cy says we must wear the same dresses,because we're sisters,although I'm five years older!I'm ugly,I know I am.But I don't mind!
'she turned to Mrs Osgood's two visitors.
'In my opinion the pretty girls are useful－I'm sure you agree－to catch the men.I don't think men are worth worrying about.Any woman with a good father and a good home had better stay single.That's what I'm going to do,anyway.We ugly girls don't need husbands!'
'And what must you do to avoid going there?
'he asked.
'And she admires him.Notice how she looks at him!But I haven't really seen her face yet.I'd like to."
'Why are you doing that?
'he asked,surprised.
'Quick,Watson.Your coat and hat.We must follow them.
'We got ready quickly and went into the street.Our friends were not far ahead of us and we followed.We stayed about a hundred metres behind them.
'I promise nothing will change when I'm married,father,'she whispered to him as they entered the church. 'You know I'll never leave you.
And it was the apple barrel that saved our lives.
So she began：'Oh Mouse,do you know the way out of this pool?I am very tired of swimming,oh Mouse!
'(Alice did not know if this was the right way to speak to a mouse.But she wanted to be polite.)
'Thank you,Ellen,you've reminded me of something.It's the way I want to be buried.My coffin will be carried to the churchyard in the evening.You and Hareton will be present,nobody else.And make sure my orders about the two coffins are obeyed!I want no ceremony,or words from the Bible—I don't believe in any of that.'
'Oh,no you won't,Ellen!
'said Heathcliff.
'I'll send for you if I want you!
'and together they left the Grange.
I was delighted to see my old friend Bessie again.She had married Robert the coachman,and was very busy with her three young children.The house itself had not changed at all,hut my cousins certainly had.
Eliza was now very tall and thin, with a rather sour face,dressed in very plain clothes,and with a cross hanging round her neck Georgiana,on the other hand,was still pretty hut very fat,and wore extremely fashionable clothes.They did not seem pleased to see me,in fact they more or less ignored me,but I hardly noticed their rudeness.I told the housekeeper that I would be staying for several days,and then went straight to my aunt's room.
I heard the sound of somebody coming.I shouted to the robot,' Hide that animal, quick!'
There was a great noise in the room when Dr Manette's name was heard.
When the shouting stopped, Dr Manette stood, pale and trembling.
'But this is like my father's story, Mr Lorry.
And wasn't it you who brought me back to England?'
Then one day there was no Christine.She was not at her home, not at the Opera House,not at their meeting places Raoul looked everywhere and asked everybody.Where was Christine Daaé?But nobody knew.
"You gotta creep up on cows so as not to spook them," he whispered over his shoulder.
Mr and Mrs Gardiner had arranged for Lydia to be married quietly in London,from their house.At first Mr Bennet had refused to allow his youngest daughter ever to enter his house again,but eventually Jane and Elizabeth persuaded him to re- ceive Lydia and her husband after the wedding.It would only be a short visit,as almost immediately she and Wickham would be moving north to Newcastle,where he had accepted a new army post.
'You didn't hear anything!Go back to you room now.
And if you don't stay there,I'll lock you in!'
Hanks and I exchanged looks.
Jackie said nothing for a minute.
'Would you like some sandwiches and coffee,Inspector?'
We put on spacesuits and went out.Buff looked at the door,very surprised.
We went in.
"How about pizza?"
There was a place called Peppy Pete's Pizzeria a block away from our guesthouse.
'The ghost has a box!
And leaves flowers in it!'
'What!
'said the young woman,opening her eyes wide.
Joseph Poorgrass hid behind a tree in case she became violent.
'How dare he answer me like that!
'Another sheep fell dead.
The men looked very serious,and did not offer their opinion.
On Monday morning Sergeant Foster went to Roger's office and asked some questions.And then he went to Albert's house and asked some more questions.Inspector Walsh sat in his office and telephoned.He made phone calls about Peter Hobbs and he made phone calls about Tom Briggs.And then he had some coffee and sandwiches.
'Be quiet!
'he ordered.
'I 've heard enough.I know Ya-hoos are bad,but I didn't realize they could possibly do such terrible things.'
'Are you going to take him out now?'
asked one of the men.
One of Mom's biggest regrets was not getting accepted to Vassar College. She vowed if she had a daughter, she'd guarantee she got in.
Mr Collins was not a sensible man,and neither education nor society had improved him.The respect he felt for his patron, and his very good opinion of himself and his new position, made him proud and servile at the same time.Now that he had a home and a considerable income,he had decided to marry.
The Bennet girls,who would lose their inheritance because of him,had a reputation for being attractive and charming,and his idea of making amends to them was to marry one of them.
He considered this an excellent plan,and thought himself ex- tremely generous and unselfish in carrying it out.
'My white dress again,I haven't got any others.'
'What?Mr Troy told you that?'
I was not sure whether I looked forward to living in London, where people like Wemmick accepted crime so calmly.
'Are your friends going?
'he asked her.
'All right,'I said.
'I'm not a good speaker,but I'll speak for a bit. '
'Mrs Lyons,' I said.'
If you did not see Sir Charles,you must tell me why.If you do not,it will look very bad for you if I have to go to the police with this new piece of information about the letter.'
In my second year at University I met a new student called Glendinning.He came from an old English family and was one of the richest students in the university.I soon realized that he was very unintelligent and because of this he was,of course,a very suitable person for me to gamble with!I started to play cards with him often,and for some time I made sure that he always won.
'You remember that dead man on the river,when I said"Don't look at his face"?Well,that was your Pop.You can get your money when you want.'
'Can't the Navy's war plans be changed?
'I asked.
'You can work on the farm for the next three days,'said Day Parks.
I cannot describe my joy when Herbert finally returned.
At last I could share my terrible news with my friend.He,too,was shocked to hear that my great expectations came from the prisoner I had helped so long ago,and when I introduced him to our guest,Herbert could hardly hide his dislike.
'We don't know,'Amundsen said.
'You're the best skier in Norway,but you get tired,and dogs get tired,too.Motor sledges don't get tired.They can go all day and all night.'
About half an hour later I heard footsteps rushing upstairs, and a young man of my age appeared breath-less at the door.
'Mr Pip? 'he said. 'I'm so sorry I'm late!'
My One and Only,
15 The future Mrs Rochester
'There is something else,I think,'said Mrs March,smoothing Meg' s cheek,which suddenly became rose-red.
'I'm so pleased that Robert's hair is black!
'she cried.
Finally,he found another field where he could hide.He lay down,unable to sleep,his mind filled with visions of the dead girl.Her wide,dead eyes stared at him,watching him through a curtain of blood.
Jo wanted to know why, but he looked so serious that instead of asking she said,'Why don't you go and dance?'
'I have always liked him, and I think he's a fair master to his servants.He's a little peculiar,perhaps.He's travelled a lot,you know.I expect he's clever,but I can't tell,really.'
He saw his friends' serious faces and stopped.
I still needed a lot of things.
'Well,'I said,'I'm going to have to make them.
'So,every day,I worked.
We left the station and went to see Mrs Laura Lyons.I in- troduced Holmes to her.After they had shaken hands,he said：'Dr Watson has told me everything,Mrs Lyons.We see Sir Charles'death as a case of murder.Both Stapleton and his wife are suspects.
"Oh, hello, Amber, what can I do for you? …late for what? … Tonight? … Unfortunately, Althea will have to reschedule.
There will be no Hour of Reflection in the Spore household tonight…"
Will smiled.
'Perhaps,'he said.
'And perhaps not.'
"Who?"
'No one was ever kind to her before she came here,'said Merrylegs.
'John and James do all they can to please her,and our master is never unkind.I'm twelve years old, and I know that there isn't a better place for a horse all round the country than this.John has been here fourteen years and is the best groom there ever was.And you never saw a kinder stableboy than James.There was no reason for Ginger to bite anyone.It's her own fault that she did not stay in the box.'
'Well, you can't go there by yourself now.It's too dark.My husband will be home in about an hour.
Wait for him and he'll walk with you.'
Alice was a little worried for her friend,but when the executioner arrived,everybody began to argue.
I knew nothing about the time your father spent in prison until he told me.
Even then I did not know that it was my family that had been so cruel to him.
I told your father that my real name was Evrémonde, and he made me promise not to tell you.
I am sure that he had forgotten the paper he had written, but what has happened now is not his fault.
At Longbourn the next day,soon after breakfast,Mr Collins asked Mrs Bennet for permission to speak pri- vately to Elizabeth Mrs Bennet was delighted,and hurried the other girls out of the room,so that Elizabeth and Mr Collins were left alone together.Elizabeth did not want to stay,and got up to leave,but after a moment's thought,sat down again quietly,determined to listen and reply politely.
Dear Mr Bront,the letter said.I am afraid that your daughter Anne is very ill,and...
They weren't acting.
There was nothing false about them.
At first I wanted to apologize and leave.
Then I stood up and went to the door and turned on the main light.
I looked at the three faces.
'Now you'll never be able to come here again,'said Cather ine to Heathcliff.
'Go away quickly!He'll return with men and guns.'
'Why can't these American women stay in their own country?They're always telling us that it's a paradise for women,'said Lord Burdon.
About one month later,I left Blefuscu,on September 24th,1701.The King,the Queen and their lords and ladies all came down to the beach to wave goodbye.
Peppy Pete's Pizzeria was like every other faux Italian restaurant I'd seen dotted throughout Southeast Asia: circular tables with the ubiquitous red-and-white checked tablecloths, bottles of Chianti with raffia bottoms, jumbo bread sticks.
But it was all a little disconcerting considering that across the street an ex-soldier land-mine amputee begged for money.
Unfortunately reminders of the war with the Khmer Rouge sat on every corner.
Suddenly,Rilla felt ill.'I can't eat now!
'she cried.But she took some coffee and began to drink.
'Let's get out of here,'she said.
'Yes,'he replied.
We all sat there talking and I could answer all their questions about the Sawyer family.I was feeling really happy about this when suddenly I heard a boat on the river.
'Tom could be on that boat,'I thought,'and he's going to walk in here and call out my name before I can stop him.I've got to go and meet him.'
Silas was silent for a moment.He was worried that perhaps Godfrey was right,and that it was selfish of him to keep Eppie.At last he made himself bring out the difficult words.
'All right.I'll say no more.Speak to the child.I won't pre－vent her from going.'

Tall tree.Spyglass shoulder,to the North of North-North-East.Skeleton Island East-South-East and by East.
'You're only taking him to try him,' said the farmer. 'If he's not as safe as any horse you ever drove, send him back,young man.'
There was a door at the other end of the tunnel.I went through and…
One of the others spoke.
'That was the Langham Place murder.
I read about that in the newspapers.
'How wonderful!
'I cried.
'How exciting!How lucky you are in Luggnagg,where a child has a chance of living for ever!And how especially lucky the Struldbrugs are!Disease,disas－ter,and death can never touch them!And imagine how much we can learn from them!I expect they're among the most im－portant people in the country.They've lived through history and know so much,which they're certain to pass on to the rest of us.If I had the chance,I'd like to spend my whole life listening to the intelligent conversation of these extraordinary people,here in Luggnagg!'
"The dog is my friend.
'Alizon said slowly. 'I wanted a friend, and I found that dog two months ago.
I told my grand－mother, and she liked the dog, too.'
' No,I don't,'I replied, and I began to think carefully.
'How many are there?'
1 Huck in trouble
'Oh,why did I come here?
'cried Agnes Resker,whocould never stay silent for long.
"By yourself!?
Stop it, Leon, I'm talking to Vassar!"
'I think it's been a hard one,'said Amy.
I was smiling as I went out,sure that he would give me nothing at all.It was a dark night,and I could hear wind in the hills.
'There may be thunder later,'I thought,not knowing how important the weather would be to me that night.
'I thought this man loved me,' she said,'but he has lied to me.Ask me what you like,Mr Holmes,and I will tell you the truth.I never thought any harm would come to Sir Charles.He was a dear old gentleman who was very kind to me.I would do nothing to hurt him.'
'Men ,you've had a hot ,tiring day,'he said.
'The boats are still in the water.
Any man who wants to can go ashore for the afternoon.You'll hear a gun half an hour before the sun goes down to call you back.'
' What is it?'
asked Jane. ' Shall we take it home?'
'I have no contact with my father,'she said.'
He gave me no help when I was in trouble.Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind people helped me when I was poor and hungry.'
'But Mr Mason's weak!You have great influence with him!'
A new year came,followed by another andanother,and still they grubbed on,until ten years had flowed on.Their efforts were not in vain.At the end of that time they had managed to pay off everything,including interest at high rate.
Breaking away from Hanks in Ta Prohm was harder than I'd anticipated.
While I sketched, he stuck to me like the adhesive on his faux chops.
For the first time since Henry's death I felt some happiness.I held out my hands to my father as he came into the room, and he took me in his arms.
He gave me the good news that Elizabeth and Ernest were safe and well.
"Man, Vassar.
This sucks.
I went to the room and, hid-den in a hole, I found a written paper. It is in Dr Manette's writing. '
My head felt strange.
My entire body felt strange.
A tingly sensation rippled across skin. A faint ringing in my ears.
Lights seemed brighter and blurred around the edges.
My stomach suddenly cramped.
I took her hand in mine.
'It is a very good book,my dear.I cannot tell you how proud I am.'
"Malaysian good, very good!"
'Well,'he said,'that story is finished.We shall never seeMr Hyde again.'
Mrs Bennet had been waiting eagerly for the end of the in- terview,and when she saw Elizabeth leave the room,she hur- ried in to offer her congratulations to Mr Collins.He received them with pleasure,adding that he was sure his cousin's re- fusal was a natural result of her modesty and delicacy of char- acter.
Alice curtsied again,and decided it would be safer not to ar- gue any more.Together,they walked on in silence up the hill.At the top Alice could see right across the country-and a very strange country it was.There were lots of little brooks running across from side to side,and there were long lines of hedges,going the other way.It was a country of squares.
'I'd like to borrow her tomorrow evening,'said Clovis lightly.
'May I,please?'
'Now,Barrymore,who is your friend on the moor?What's going on?'
Marilla smiled and touched Anne's hot face.
'No, they won't, Anne.
Mrs Allan wasn't angry, you know.
She said it was very kind of you to make her a cake, and she's asked you to tea at her house! '
'It was a wonderful evening for us, Tom,' Old Mr White answered.
'Your stories were very interesting. Our life isn't very exciting and we don't have the money to visit India, so please come again soon. You can tell us some more stories about India.'
'Jo,how could you?
'cried Meg.
Later that same afternoon Mr Utterson found his way toDoctor Jekyll's house.Jekyll's servant, Poole, let himin at once and took him through the kitchen and across theback garden to the laboratory behind the house.It was thefirst time that Mr Utterson had seen his friend's laboratory,and he looked around curiously.
In London,I did some serious thinking.I could see that my character had not improved since I had heard about my expectations.I was spending far too much money.What was worse,I was a bad influence on Herbert,who was also spend－ing too much.I would have offered to pay his bills,but he was too proud to listen to such a suggestion.I had hoped that on my twenty－first birthday I would discover more about my future,but Mr Jaggers explained that he could not give me any more information,except that from now on I would have five hundred pounds a year to spend as I liked.I suddenly thought of a way I could help Herbert.
Barsad called two men into the room, and told them to lift the unconscious man and carry him out.
Early that morning,Earth Commander's house was quiet.A guard opened the door.
'I don't mind confessing I was hoping to be her farm man－ ager,'said Gabriel in his honest way.
'But Miss Everdene can do as she likes,and she's chosen to manage her own farm—and keep me as an ordinary shepherd only.
'He sounded rather depressed,and looked sadly into the fire.
When they came down the steps again, the Toad was still talking excitedly to the Mole. 'So you see, everything is ready for when we start this afternoon. '
What on earth could GG possibly blackmail my parents about?
It was time to be direct:
I remembered my mother's advice, and the next day I tried to do exactly what my master wanted me to do.He was a very good rider,and when he came home his wife was waiting for him at the door.
'Paddington Station,'said the woman.
Mr Wopsle went in to discover what was happening,and after a few minutes rushed out,calling,'Something wrong up at the forge,Pip!Run!They say perhaps it was an escaped convict who got into the house while Joe was out.Someone's been attacked!'
'My dear Basil,how unkind you are!
'Lord Henry was amused.How interesting other people's lives were,he thought.Slowly he pulled a flower to pieces with his long fingers.
'I remember now,'he continued.
'I think my aunt knows Dorian Gray.I'd like to meet him very much.'
'Only five! 'laughed Dickon.
'And the City Council,'said another man,wants to close all the theatres.They always do that when the plague comes to London.There'll be no work for any of us actors.'
'I suppose I ought.
Indeed,I want to,but I cannot. '
'May I write to you?'
Friday was a quick learner and his English got better day by day.
He helped me with the goats and with the work in the cornfields,and soon we were good friends.
I enjoyed teaching him and,most of all,having a friend to talk to. This was the happiest of all my years on the island.
Who art as black as hell,as dark as night.
At first his wife did not answer,but then she said,'Well, Herbert laughed about it…'
He laughed.
'And Rosamund Oliver?
'asked Mary gently.
I was sorry for Ginger, but as the weeks went on, she be-came happier and more gentle.
My master had a daughter who was about nine years old.She was given the special responsibility of taking care of me,and I owe her my life.During my stay in her country we were always together,and she saved me from many dangerous situa-tions.I called her Glumdalclitch,which means'little nurse'.She was good at sewing,and managed to make some clothes for me in the thinnest material available.She also made me a small bed,which was placed on a shelf too high for rats to reach.Perhaps the most useful thing she did was to teach me the language,so that in a few days I could speak it quite well.
I plucked it out of her hand and demonstrated its attributes.
"First you unscrew this little nozzle; after it inflates, you place it on the toilet and use the facilities.
Once you're finished, you simply push it back inside the special rubber bag and—this is the revolutionary part—it sanitizes itself! All ready for the next usage.
And it doesn't waste paper like regular seat covers, so it's environmentally sound."
When Mr Nowell' s men brought my mother to Read Hall, she said nothing at first.
'"See here,"said the doctor doubtfully,"it isn't usual for aman to walk into an empty house at four in the morning andcome out with another man's cheque for nearly a hundredpounds."
'This St John,do you like him?'
'No,I haven't asked her,'said Godfrey,feeling very hot ad uncomfortable,'but I don't think she'll accept me.'
'I'm not ashamed of my name.
It's David Balfour.'
' Don' t talk so much, Toad, ' said the girl. 'Now listen, I think I have a plan. '
And here she whispered in the Toad' s ear.
9 Gulliver escapes from Brobdingnag
'This is the little girl I wrote to you about,'said Mrs Reed to the stony stranger.
'Mr Ross is…Jake Rosso!'
We had to scream and yell to wake him up again.At last we did wake him up, and we got into the boat.
'Did you keep any of these written orders?
'asked Mr Utterson.
'I'm not asking you to like him,'said his friend.
'Well,Molly was angry with everyone and went upstairs.We went into the kitchen for coffee.Jackie wanted everyone to go up and say good night to Molly.She lives here with Molly so she wanted Molly to be happy.At first Roger said no.He was angry and didn't want to see his mother.'
Spring Zs No More!
'Nancy,'said Godfrey slowly,'when I married you,I hid something from you—I was wrong not to tell you.That woman Silas Marner found dead in the snow—Eppie's moth er—that poor woman—was my wife.Eppie is my child.'
I jumped up suddenly and ran into the crowds of people in the dark.I was safe.He couldn't find me.I went to our robot plane and sat inside until my parents came.
'Angel,we do want to meet your wife.We are not in the least angry about this rather hurried wedding,so why haven't you brought her?It seems strange.'
'What's this?
'he wanted to know.
"I'm not lying and I'm not dying.
I'm in better health than most senior citizens.
There's no lower blood pressure to be found in any bingo parlor anywhere."
My master's plan was so successful that he arranged to show me again on the next market day.I did not look forward to this at all.I was so tired with the journey and the entertainment that I could only walk an speak with difficulty for the next three days.Even when we were at home,neighbours and friends from all parts of the country came to look at me,and my master made me work hard to amuse them.So I had almost no rest.
About a week later,we were sailing round the rocky coast of northern Scotland in very bad weather.It was difficult to see anything because of the thick fog.One evening there was a great crash,and the officers ran out to see what had happened.I thought we had hit a rock,but in fact it was a small boat As we watched,the boat broke in two,and went to the bottom with all its men,except the one passenger.At the moment of the crash,this man managed to jump up and catch the side of the ship and pull himself up.
While Angkor Wat had been practically pristine, Ta Prohm was one big mess.
A hodgepodeg of foliage and stone that had remained untouched for centuries.
No attempt had been made to restore it.
Banyan and fig trees had spread their giant trunks and roots through the stone blocks, spiltting apart walls and foundations, and toppling towers.
'The picture showed us that Stapleton was indeed a Baskerville,'Holmes began.
'He was the son of Roger Baskerville,who was Sir Charles'younger brotner.Roger was a criminal who escaped from prison and ran away to South America.Everyone thought he had died unmarried,but that was not true.He had one son,also called Roger,whom we knew as Stapleton.Stapleton married a beautiful South Ameri- can,and came to England,where he started a school in the north.He discovered that he would inherit the Baskerville lands and fortune if Sir Charles and Sir Henry both died.That is why he moved to Devonshire when the school closed.
But because of him, David Riccio was dead.
I could never forget that.Never.
"Hanks, I'm tired.
Just tell me which room you want."
'Well,Aaron was talking to me about it,'replied Eppie,blushing. 'You know he's nearly twenty-four now,and is earning good money, and he'd like to marry soon.'
Please forward this letter to the Ehretsmannsandto the Woytts.
Soon we left the town behind us,and we were out in the country.We rode like the wind and by ten o'clock had come to the edge of the forest of Zenda.
And Troy,in his bright red uniform,was there.
'Where did these animals come from?
'I asked.
'At last, it has begun, my dear, ' said Defarge to his wife.
It was the fourteenth of July, 1789.
'I thought you were already dead,'I said.
But the Brilliant plan didn't seem to make a difference. The lines whre still there. Her mouth still drooped. Apparently, my odds of making or not making valedictorian were secondary to the Big Secret.
'You must be hungry,Heathcliff,'I said.
'You haven't eaten all day.
Have some Christmas cake,do.'
'Are you telling us that you have found a way of teachinganimals to talk?
'Sir Wilfrid was saying.
'And our dear oldTobermory is your first successful student?'
3 The Photograph
Ten days after their mother went away,Beth came home late after one of several visits to a sick baby at the Hummels'house.She went straight to her mother's room and shut herself inside.Half an hour later,Jo found her sitting there,looking very ill.
'But why is that funny?
Doesn't everybody do that?'
However,a wonderful thing happened.During a long conversation with Mr Spenlow in the office,he mentioned that it was Dora's birthday the following week,and invited me to a picnic to celebrate it.As soon as I heard this,I went completely mad,and could not think at all clearly.In the next week I bought expensive new clothes and boots,and arranged to hire a handsome white horse.On the day of the picnic, I got up at six in the morning and went to Govent Garden market to buy the freshest and most beautiful flowers for Dora,and by ten o'clock I was riding towards the Spenlows'house.
The Psammead made itself very big and then went small again.
The children felt strange for a minute and when they looked, they saw that they had beautiful soft wings of many colours.
They moved them about and jumped up and down, and soon they could see the green fields and sunny woodsbelow them and the blue sky above.
They could fly!
It was wonderful, and they flew over the woods and trees, the townsand villages, for a long time.
But they began to get hungry.
He threw himself at me and I jumped to one side,leaving him to fall on the deck.Quickly,I took a pistol from my pocket and aimed it at him----he powder was wet and the pistol didn't fire!He got up and came at me with surprising speed,but suddenly the Hispaniola hit the sand and went over on one side.We were.both thrown down and began to roll across the deck,but I was on my feet first and climbed up into the sails,hand over hand.When I was in a safe place,I loaded my pistols,this time with dry powder.
'The King isn't herer!
'I said.
'You alone must decide what to do,' he replied,'and now I must leave you,so that nobody suspects me of warning you.'
The bullet was deep in my arm, and I lost a lot of blood.After some days my arm began to get better, but I became sadder and angrier than before.
I had saved the girl's life, and how did they thank me?
With a bullet in the arm!I began to realize that there was no happiness for me in life.
Hate grew stronger in me every day .Hate for you, my creator, who had made me.
'It's just like a large chess-board!
'Oh, and I can see some chessmen down there!
'Her heart began to beat fast with excitement.
'It's a great game of chess, as big as the world itself-if this is the world at all.Oh,what fun!
I wish I could be in it,even as a Pawn.Although I would love to be a Queen,of course.'
'Well,you see,' Morris said,'this monkey's paw is magic!'

'Good Heavens!
'cried the gentleman. 'My dear Mr Scrooge,are you serious?'
I stopped and put the notebook on my bedside table.
I'd wait until I had a good night's sleep, because right now I obviously wasn't thinking too clearly.
Once again he shook his head.
Then,for the last time, the Psammead went big,then small again.
It looked at them all once more with its long eyes,and then dug itself quickly into the sand.
'Marry me!That's too foolish—too soon—to think of!'
His listless resignation brought a sick feeling to ma stomach.
'The courage to do what?
'he asked.
The next day it was very rainy,so Mary did not go out.Instead she decided to wander round the house,looking into some of the hundred rooms that Mrs Medlock had told her about.
She spent all morning going in and out of dark,silent rooms, which were full of heavy furniture and old pictures.She saw no servants at all,and was on her way back to her room for lunch, when she heard a cry.
'It's a bit like the cry that I heard last night!
'she thought.Just then the housekeeper,Mrs Medlock, appeared,with her keys in her hand.
Clare was a thoughtful, honest man.
He knew Tess was not a toy to play with and throw away when finished with.
Her life was as important to her as his was to him.
He knew he must treat her affection for him seriously.
But if they went on meeting every day, their relationship must develop： he could not stop himself.As he had not decided what purpose their relationship should have, he decided that for the moment they should meet as little as possible.
But it was not easy to keep to this decision.He was driven towards her by the heat in his blood.
I walked up and down for two or three minutes, then I said：'Henry, go back to these men.
'On Saturday night,then.After the opera,'Raoul said.
'I'm going to take you away,and marry you.'
It was a long hard fight,but by now it was dark and this helped us very much.
We ran here and there in the trees,call-ing and shouting.
The seamen could not see us and did not know how many men they were fighting. In the end the first officer shouted to them：
On the twenty-seventh day of April, the guards took my mother and James to Lancaster Castle, and my life at Read Hall began.Suddenly,it was spring.The sky was blue and there were beautiful flowers on the hills.
From Read Hall,Pendle Hill looked different ： it looked smaller, and it was not so important in my life.Sometimes I walked along Sabden Brook to Sabden, and then to Newchurch, and I felt happy to be near Pendle Hill again.But I never visited Malkin Tower again.
'Ben Gunn!
'shouted Silver.
'Cry as much as you like,Miss Cathy,'he said.
'In a few days I'll be your father,and I'll punish you just like that,as often as necessary!'
In the spring,Lord Gray and some of his family went up to London and took York with them.Two daughters remained at the Hall.Lady Harriet never went out in the carriage,and Lady Anne preferred riding on horseback with her brother or cousins.She chose me for her horse and I enjoyed these rides,sometimes with Ginger,sometimes with Lizzie,a horse liked by the young gentlemen.
'It is true.I came early on business.The rest of the party will be here tomorrow.Among them are Mr Bingley and his sisters, whom you know.
'He continued after a pause,'And there is one other person who particularly wishes to meet you.Will you allow me,or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to you?'
Will and I spent the summer at Stratford.When Christmas came,the King's Men put on a lot of plays at court.The King was at Hampton Court Palace that year,which was outside London,well away from the plague.I couldn't go because I fell off my horse one day and broke my leg.Stupid thing to do!I had to stay at home,but Will told me all about it when he came back.
'If you don't like what I say, I'm ready to fight,' I answered stupidly.
I knew that I was not strong enough to hold a sword.
The Persian smiled.
'Ah yes!What happened to young Raoul and the beautiful Christine…?Who knows?'
Amundsen smiled.
'No,'he said.
'I don't think so.And Scott doesn't like dogs.So his men are going to pull their sledges up these mountains themselves.Would you like to do that,Olav?'
'Only a shepherd!You seem almost like a farmer to me. '
"Hurry on up.
I need to shave."
Hanks's voice wafted through the wooden slats of the bathroom door.
He looked up. 'Don't then! 'he said angrily.
'You believe Simon,if you want to!He's a journalist,after all—I'm only a biologist,and your father.Why should you believe me?
'He stood up angrily,walked to the door,and opened it.
'I'm sor-ry,Christine.I've had a hard day,I'm tired,and I don't want to sit here listening to my daughter telling me I'm a liar.Go home to Simon.I'm going to bed!'
'You have no relations apart from Mrs Reed?'
During the last two weeks, Mom and Dad had experienced a couplete role reversal. It unsettled me.
"The Minister of Education and Madame Georges Ramponneau have the honour to request the company of Monsieur and Madame Loisel at the office of the Ministry on Monday evening,January 18th."
The children stood there for a second, and then Anthea turned to speak to the others.
But they were not there!
She was looking at three strangers— a girl with beautiful red hair and big blue eyes, and two very good-looking boys.
Suddenly she understood.
They had their wish. The strangers were Robert and Cyril and Jane—but now they were beautiful.
Cyril's hair was golden now, and Robert's was black.
Sam
The next morning when my servant Paddock arrived,I introduced him to Captain Digby.
I explained that the Captain was an important man in the army,but he had been working too hard and needed rest and quiet.
Then I went out,leaving them both in the flat.
When I returned at about lunchtime,the doorman told me that the gentleman in flat 15 had killed himself.
I went up to the top floor,had a few words with the police,and was able to report to Scudder that his plan had been successful.
The police believed that the dead man was Scudder,and that he had killed himself.
Scudder was very pleased.
'At another house of his, Ferndean Manor, thirty miles away.
'To get the house,of course,the house of Shaws.'
'Jane!
'he said sadly,'you don't love me,then?'
They returned the next day with the coffin and four men from the workhouse who were to carry it.The man and the old woman followed the coffin to the church,and waited silently by the grave for the priest to arrive.When at last he came, he hurried through the burial prayers, and as quickly as possible（it was only a job,after all） the coffin was put into the ground.
At this point the husband, who had not moved once during his wife's burial- not even during the long wait for the priest-suddenly fainted to the ground and had to have cold water thrown over him.
A minute later,Sikes appeared on the roof and the shouts from the crowd below swelled to a great roar.Then the front door was smashed down and people streamed into the house.Sikes quickly tied the rope around the chimney,then began to tie the other end around himself,ready to lower himself to the ground behind the house.But just as he put the rope over his head,he screamed in terror and threw his arms above his head.He staggered back,slipped and fell over the edge of the roof.As he fell,the rope tightened around his neck with a horrible jerk.In a second the murderer was dead,and the re he hung,his body swinging gently from side to side.The dog,which had followed its master onto the roof,jumped down towards the lifeless body,missed,and fell dead on the stones below.
'You come from another world,Jane,from the world of the dead.I think you must be a spirit.And absent for a whole month!I'm sure you've quite forgotten me.'
'Come and sit down! Finish eating!
'Mr White said.
"Why are your parents even letting you go?
Have they joined a cult?
Been experimenting with mind-altering substances?" asked Amber half-seriously.
"But my father had such a good heart that he didn't want to be without us.So he always came to find us,and took us home,and hit us.So you see,Pip,I never learnt much.'
We arrived at Herbert Pocket's rented rooms.
The building was the dirtiest I had ever seen, with broken windows and dusty doors.It stood in a little square with dying trees around it.I looked in horror at Mr Wemmick.
'Yes,yes,' the old man answered,'but for a minute or two I was afraid.'
'What a strange shop!
'Alice said. 'I wish things wouldkeep still!'
So,of course,Mother thought that he was one of the thieves.
She would not listen to the children and decided to go at once into town to tell the police.
The children could not stop her.
It was the loveliest,most exciting place she had ever seen.
There were old rose trees everywhere,and the walls were covered with climbing roses.She looked carefully at the grey branches.Were the roses still alive?Ben would know.She hoped they weren't all dead.But she was inside the wonderful garden,in a world of her own.It seemed very strange and silent,but she did not feel lonely at all.Then she noticed some small green shoots coming up through the grass.So something was growing in the garden after all!When she found a lot more shoots in different places,she decided they needed more air and light,so she began to pull out the thick grass around them.She worked away,clearing the ground,for two or three hours,and had to take her coat off because she got so hot.The robin hopped around,pleased to see someone gardening.
Dear Lanyon,
He snapped a Polariod of my bare ankles.
But the three old men did not seem to agree with Harris.
'You look lovely in this colour,dear child!You know you always have whatever you want in the end,although you never give orders or shout about it.I'm looking forward to seeing you married.It'll be fun watching you make your husband do exactly what you want.'
Silence.
I snatched up my daypack.
A guard in a wrinkled unform strolled by—wrinkled because he'd probably just woken up.
He paused.
He went upstairs to the quiet bedroom,where the chlid lay.Poor Bob sat down beside him, and when he felt calmer, he kissed the little face,and went downstairs again,almost happy.
'My name is Jaggers,and I'm a lawyer,'he said,when he reached the forge.
'Joe Gargery,I am sent by someone who suggests cancelling this boy's apprenticeship to you.Would you want any money,if you lost your apprentice?'
'Don't ask me,'said his friend,Helmer Hanssen,'I don't understand it.'
Then Buck had another surprise.
Francois put a harness on him.
Buck had seen harnesses on horses, and now he was made to work like a horse, pulling Francois on a sledge into the forest and returning with wood for the fire.
Buck worked with Spitz and Dave.The two other dogs had worked in a har－ness before, and Buck learnt by watching them.
He also learnt to stop and turn when Francois shouted.
John Duncan turned,and walked slowly towards the door.
'Father is afraid I'll die soon,you see,so he wants us to be married tomorrow morning.You'll have to stay here all night,Cathy.Then perhaps he'll let you go home in the morning.'
'The Black Stone,'I cried, sitting down,and looking at five frightened men.
A loud,evil laugh rang out through the silent night.Then I heard the monsters's voice：'It pleases me that you have decided to live, because that is just what I want.'
She managed a weak smile. "Maybe later."
'Very well,thank you.
'He said no more.
I was a little surprised by that.
'And for you,Maria,'I said.
'Don't forget yourself.You are the most important per－son in the world,to me.'
'Can this be possible,uncle? 'asked Mrs Joe.
DENISE
'Take the money and run on,' my mother said breathlessly.
But I refused to leave her.
Quickly, I pulled her off the road and down under a small bridge .There we hid ,trembling.
'That's right.We know that the next falling star is almost certain to get too close to the sun,and catch fire!And when the earth passes through that fire,it'll be destroyed immedi－ately!'
He looked at me quietly for a moment. 'wouldn't have had the pleasure of breakfast with you gentlemen. But I had to come.Got a message for you, Pip.Miss Havisham says Es-tella's come home and would be glad to see you.'
'I know I talk too much!
'she laughed.
Elizabeth was delighted to discover that Georgiana Darcy,far from being proud,as Wickham had said,was just very shy,with quiet,gentle manners.It was clear that she greatly ad－mired her brother,and had every intention of liking Miss Ben－net,as Darcy had spoken of her so favourably.Elizabeth was al-so satisfied to see that Bingley,who was with the Darcys,did not seem particularly interested in Georgiana, in spite of Caro－line Bingley's wishes.And she had to admit that she had never seen Mr Darcy behaving so sociably and pleasantly,not only to herself, but also to the relations to whom he had referred with such disdain during that last conversation in Hunsford Rectory.Elizabeth herself was more than usually anxious to make herself agreeable to everybody, and she succeeded, be－cause Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy de－termined,to be pleased.
Her face was very white in the dark.
'I want it,'she said quietly, 'and you've got it! Give it to me! Please!'
So our mode of transportation ws the Tonle Sap Lake and River via bullet boat, an ancient hot-dog-shaped vessel so jam-packed with passengers that some had to sit on the roof.
A virtual death trap with no escape if it should submerge.
Not for the claustrophobic.
A few days later,in the town north of Weatherbury where the soldiers were staying,a wedding was arranged As the church clock in the square struck half-past eleven,a handsome young soldier marched into the church and spoke to the vicar Then he stood still in the centre of the church,waiting for his bride.
The church was full of the women and girls who had at－ tended the morning service and had decided to wait to see the wedding.
They watched the young man's straight back,whis－ pering among themselves.
The soldier waited without moving a muscle.
The church clock struck a quarter to twelve,and still the bride did not come.
The whispers stopped,and there was silence.
The young man stood as stiff and straight as the church columns around him.
There was a little quiet laughter from some of the women,but soon they were silent again,waiting for the end.
'David, leave me!
I can't talk about it now!'
she sobbed.
I felt a pang—there lives were continuing without me.
Fuming.
'But he'd been dead for a week by then. '
My father took my arm.
'What about Farmer Boldwood?Perhaps he can do it?'
Heathcliff noticed little of what was happening around him,and would never have been aware of the cousins'feelings,if it hadn't been for Joseph.In the middle of our lunch one day,the old man rushed into the room,shaking with anger.
'Well,what do you want me to do,John?I'm not a moth-er and I've never been married.'
When he woke up in the morning,he ran out to me.
I was milking my goats in the field,and he got down on the ground and put his head near my foot.
I understood that he was thank－ing me,and I tried to show him that I was his friend.
I was pleased to lose Long John and began to enjoy looking around this strange island.
I crossed wet ground and came to a long,open piece of sand, then went on to a place where the trees had branches that were thick and close to the sand.
He got up from his desk, came round to the front,and held out his hand.
John stood still for a long moment. Then he shook hands.
'Please choose,Meg.I love to teach,and this is easier than German,'said John, taking her other hand.
'We must be very careful not to show that we suspect him,'Holmes warned me.
She seemed surprised.
"No, for the collage.
I don't believe in souvenirs.
That's what memories are for."
We arrived home at last on April 13th,1702,and I saw my dear wife and children again.At first I was delighted to be at home again.I earned quite a lot of money by showing my Lil－liputian animals to people,and in the end I sold them for a high price.But as the days passed,I became restless,and wanted to see more of the world.And so,only two months later,I said goodbye to my family and sailed away again.
I felt like a boy on a walking holiday,instead of a man of thirty-seven very much wanted by the police.
I walked along the road whistling,feeling happier every minute.
'I wish I knew.Horrible thoughts of death,and blood,have been with me all day.I don't know why.'
Then Israel Hands turned with a low cry of pain.He looked across at me and whispered one word：'Rum'.
I wondered if I should continue working with Joe in a plain,honest way of life,and perhaps marry Biddy. Or dare I hope that Miss Havisham would make my fortune and marry me to Estella?
'If it's what I want to hear-twenty－five pounds, 'said Monks.
'But it's a lot of money for something which has been lying dead for twelve years.
'Reluctantly, he pushed the money across the table towards her, then bent forward to listen.
The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the table to hear what the woman had to say, and the woman leant over towards them so that They could hear her whisper.
In the dim lamplight their faces looked pale and ghostly.
The coffin was carried into a small sitting-room and Gabriel was left alone with it.
In spite of all his care,the worst had happened,and Bathsheba was about to make a terrible discovery.
But suddenly he had an idea.
He looked at the words written simply on the coffin lid—Fanny Robin and child. With a cloth Gabriel carefully removed the last two words.
Quietly he left the room.
'No!
'You're Jake Rosso!You look different now,yes.You've got short hair,you've got a moustache now,and you wear glasses.But you're… Jake… Rosso.You were my favourite pop star, so I know.'
'My dear Pip,Mr Gargery asks me to tell you he will be in Lon－don soon,and could visit you at 9 o'clock on Tuesday morning,at Mr Herbert Pocket's rooms, if that is all right with you.He and I talk about you every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing.
It started to rain,and I spent the afternoon under a rock.
That night was the most miserable of all.
There were no stars,and I got lost a least twice.
I had about fifteen kilometres more to go,but I think I walked thirty.
In the end, in the very early morning,in a thick fog,I knocked on Mr Turnbull's door.
'But,miss,how can I say he doesn't if he—'
2 Visit to Australia
'Very good,'said the King.
'Call the first witness.'
'I'll get it,'said Jo,pushing past him.
'Now Meg can tell him,'she thought.
Edward put the letter on the fire.
'And do you think that divorce is "modern", Mr Baldwin?'
Just before dinner,a telegram arrived.It was from Sir Henry and said：'Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall.'
Godfrey had one great fear at that moment,that the woman was not dead.If she were his wife,and she were dead,he would be free to marry Nancy!
How stupid I was!I had an easy,comfortable life in Brazil,but,of course,I agreed.
And so,in 1659,I went to sea again.
That got me.
I leaned against a kedai wall to put them on.
The boy was about O liver's age, but was one of the strangest-looking people he had ever seen.
He had a dirty,ordinary boy's face, but he behaved as if he were an adult.
He was short for his age and had little, sharp,ugly eyes.
His hat was stuck on top of his head but it looked as though it would blow off at any minute.
He wore a man's coat which reached almost down to his feet, with sleeves so long that his hands were completely covered.
Silver pulled at the rope that held me,and turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look.I could read his thoughts.So near to the gold now,everything was forgotten—his promise and the doctor's warning.I knew he hoped to take the treasure,cut every honest throat on that island,find and board the Hispaniola at night,and sail away a rich man and a murderer.
I wanted a shower.
I wanted food.
I wanted quiet.
And I wanted Grandma Gerd here.
Now.
He spoke in an easy,friendly way.Mary liked him at once.
As they were looking at the seed packets together,the robin hopped on to a branch near them.Dickon listened carefully to the robin's song.
'Describe the shape,Jane.'
'Mars?He's crazy!Mars isn't ready for people,'Adai said.
In his childhood,Silas had been taught,by his mother,to make simple medicines from wild flowers and plants.One day he saw the shoemaker's wife,Sally Oates,sitting at her cottage door,and he realized she had all the signs of the illness which had killed his mother.He felt sorry for Sally,and although he knew he could not prevent her dying,he prepared some medicine for her which made her feel much better.The vil－lagers considered this a good example of Silas's strange,fright－ening power,but as it had worked for Sally,they started visit-ing Silas to ask for help with their own illnesses.But Silas was too honest to take their money and give them useless medicine.He knew he had no special power,and so he sent them away.The villagers believed he was refusing to help them,and they were angry with him.They blamed him for accidents that hap－pened to them,and deaths in the village.So poor Silas's kind－ness to Sally did not help him make friends in Raveloe.
We left the skeleton behind,but now the pirates kept together and talked in frightened whispers.At the top of the hill,Silver took out his compass again.
'How strange!But why does Mr Ross always look sad?And why does he never leave the island?
'I asked.
'It's all right,Jim.I'm not dead,' I said.
'But why are you here on the island?'
I asked.
'Yes,'replied the lawyer.
The guard opened a different door,and Bel and the cat went into a beautiful room with expensive,very old tables and chairs.Rilla and Kiah went in behind them.There were no windows in the room,but a lot of pictures.There was Gog!The richest man on Earth;and the worst man on Earth.He was tall and fat,and without much hair.He sat behind a big table with a television,three computers and five telephones.He watched the television and didn't look at Kiah or Rilla.Two guards with guns stood behind him and two more guards stood near the door.
Mr Ross finished speaking on the phone,then looked care fully at my mother and me.For a few seconds he didn't speak,and just watched us.Then he said,'I'm pleased to meet you,Mrs Sanders.I need some help with my work.My secretary is in hospital,and there's a lot of work to do.
Sometimes you'11have to work late at night,because of time differences in New York and Tokyo.Is that all right?'
I put Miss Murdstone out of my mind,and for several weeks after meeting Dora,I lived in a dream.I did my work automatically,and I never stopped thinking of her.The greatest happiness I could imagine was being engaged to Dora.I dared not hope that one day we would be married.
Several years passed without any more news of Linton.In 1800 Cathy reached the age of sixteen.We never celebrated her birthday,because it was also the day her mother died.On this particular day she came downstairs,dressed for going out,and suggested a walk on the moors with me.Her father gave permission.
'You will go to the prison of La Force!'
They all heard his words clearly.
The sound of wheels came from the road,and Bathsheba arrived.
Boldwood took her into the house,and the door closed behind them.
'Oh,Rudolf,be careful!
'He's a dangerous man!Please come back safely to me.'
'I'm glad of that.Will it do us any good, mother?'
Dolly's explanation of her simple religion did not seem at all clear to Silas,but he did understand that she was asking him to go to church.He did not want to agree to that.Just then young Aaron came out from behind his mother's chair,and Silas of-fered him one of Dolly's cakes.
Tess ran upstairs,but through the thin walls she could hear the whole story being told to Sir John.
But she liked the money,and the new house,and the new dresses—and the six fields of apple trees and the big farm north of Stratford that came a few years later.
Tom thought for a bit,and then he said,'I know.You take my bags and say they're yours.
I'll come to the house in about half an hour.'
The harvesters followed the machine, picking and tying up bundles of corn.
The girls were perhaps more interesting to look at.They wore large cotton hats to keep off the sun, and gloves to protect their hands from the corn.The prettiest was the one in the pale pink jacket,who never looked around her as she worked.She moved forward, bending and tying like a machine.Occasionally she stood up to rest.Then her face could be seen：a lovely young face,with deep dark eyes and long heavy curling hair.Her cheeks were paler,her teeth more regular, and her red lips thinner than most country girls'.
'Sit yourselves down by the fire, while I get you some supper. '
'Open the door,will you?
'shouted a voice through the keyhole.
Mr Bumble shook his head again, very seriously, and turned down the corners of his mouth.
I became very ill,and could not breathe without pain.John looked after me day and night,and my master often came to see me too.
'I'm leaving,'said Mavis Pellington.
'I refuse to stayanother hour in this house.'
Mary's uncle had black hair with some white in it,and high, crooked shoulders.His face was not ugly,but very sad.During their conversation he watched her in a worried way.Perhaps he was thinking of other things at the same time.
Fssst!
As the months and years passed, Dorian Gray grew more and more afraid of the picture.
He both hated it and loved it,and he became more and more afraid that someone would discover his secret.For weeks he tried not to go near it,but he could not stay away from it for long.Sometimes, when he was staying in friends'houses, he suddenly left and hurried back to London.
He wanted to be sure that the room was still locked and the picture was still safe.
At one time he used to spend winters with Lord Henry in a little house in Algiers, but now he no longer travelled outside England.
What did that mean?
Exactly how was Sarah a prig?
He looked at his watch.
'I'm in a hurry,but my house is very near.
Let me give you some food and a bed.
But what about your luggage?Is it in the river?'
'Those were his words,'said Nancy,looking round uneasily,as if she still expected to see Sikes.
'And then hetalked about how amazed you would be if you knew who O liver really was.
'Dear Miss Havisham!
'said one of the ladies lovingly. 'How well you look!'
The next question was where to sleep at night.
At first Elizabeth and Jane were delighted that their sister's reputation would be saved through marriage,even to such a man as Wickham.But then their father explained that Wick- ham would never have agreed to marry Lydia,unless he had been paid a considerable amount of money immediately.They began to worry that it would be difficult to repay Mr Gardiner,who must have bribed Wickham in this way.Mrs Bennet,however,had no such worries.
'I'll ride him tomorrow.'
Victor Frankenstein died a few hours after he had written his last word.I was sad to see him die, because he had become a good friend.But he will not be unhappy or in pain any more,and I am happy for him
'That's right, sir.
Joseph Merrick.
The best ElephantMan in England! I take him all over the country, you know. Lots of people want to see him. '
Sikes got up and locked the door.
'Yes,sir, always,'replied John.
'Without your love,Jane,my heart is broken,'he said.
'But perhaps you will,so generously,give me your love after all—'He jumped up with hope in his eyes,holding out his arms to me.But I turned and ran out of the room.
They left the prison building in the grey light of dawn.Outside in the street,huge crowds were already gathering,joking and laughing,and pushing to get the best places near the great black platform,where the rope hung ready for its morning's work.
Although Priscilla was right in saying she was not good-looking,she was very popular among her neighbours because she was so cheerful and sensible.And Nancy was not only con－sidered to be the most beautiful girl in and around Raveloe,but also one of the most intelligent.
Mr Laurence came back with Beth.He offered to go with Mrs March,but she wouldn't let the old gentleman make the long,tiring journey,although he could see that she would like to have somebody with her.He went away again,saying,'I'll be back.
Inspector Walsh stood in front of the windows and looked at them,one by one.
'I want to talk to you Someone killed Molly Clarkson.Someone put sleeping tablets in her hot milk and killed her Nobody wanted to tell me the true story,but now I know the true story and I'm going to tell you.'
It was an extraordinary story. I didn't understand all of it,and I had to ask a lot of questions,but here it is：
This visit was repeated twice a week,but there was little other entertainment in Hunsford.
Elizabeth had pleasant con－ versations with Charlotte, or read books, or walked along a narrow path by Lady Catherine's park, which no one else seemed to use.It was a quiet life, but she was satisfied with it.
' You can't buy me,'said Robert,' but I'll come and show myself this afternoon,if you give me fifteen pounds—and some food!'
'But Mother,you don't understand.He's seventeen,and it was his first job.He's very,very angry.He says… he says he's going to kill you!'
My mother and I left the island at the end of the summer.Soon after,I went to college.
James stood up slowly.
'Go out and find food,'he said.
'I must go out and find food.'
'What time was this?'
The Mole's hat was missing, and so were his boots.
'Have you forgotten her kindness to you last winter,when you wrote that you loved her,and she used to come through wind and snow to see you?Now you believe your father's lies about her!And you leave her alone,ill and crying in a strange house!You pity yourself,but you won't pity her!What a heartless,selfish boy you are!'
Jerry Barker was a small man,but well－made and quick in all his movements.He lived in London and was a cab driver.Jerry's wife,Polly,was a little woman with smooth dark hair and dark eyes.His son,Harry,was nearly twelve years old, and was a tall,good－tempered boy.His daughter,Dolly,was eight,and she looked just like her mother.
I was happy to wear the spacesuit.Hoo-Woo took me to the door where I first came in.
"Probably because you thought it'd be highly amusing if I were forced to sleep—room—with a guy."
It was not possible to leave Paris at once, as Charles did not have the necessary papers.
They must live quietly, and hope to leave as soon as they could.
I prepared to do the unthinkable (use water and left hand) when—
"Postcard labels?"
'Emily will go?
'I said.I looked at her.Emily had only been away from home twice,and each time she had been very un-happy.But now she looked excited.
Meanwhile Linton had got up from his armchair and gone out to join Cathy and Hareton.Through the open window I could hear the two younger ones laughing at Hareton's coarse way of speaking.I began to disliker Linton rather than pity him.
'If anybody in the jury can explain that letter,'said Alice （she was not afraid of anything now,because she was much bigger than everybody in the room）,'I'll give him sixpence.It's all nonsense!It doesn't mean anything.'
On March 7th Scott looked at Oates's feet.They were big and black.
'I can't pull the sledge now,'Oates said.
'It's very difficult to walk.Am I going to lose these feet,Captain?'
Kiah stood up.He was nearly two metres tall,with dark eyes and hair.
'Yes,come on,'he said.
'You killed Zadak,but one day someone is going to kill you.'
'No,ma'am,'answered Laban.
'When his sheep ate some clover the other day,and were swollen just like these,he sent for Cabriel at once,and Gabriel saved their lives. '
'Yes, of course, Sir.'
We laughed at this,and then one of us said,'All right.Now go and fetch the real boat.'
'I want to train young horses,'he told the master.
'Her name's Peggotty.
Her first name's Clara,the same as mine, so I call her by her family name,you see.'
'What a terrible name!
However, never mind. Peggotty!
'she called, going to the door.
'Bring Mrs Copperfield some tea at once!'
She sat down again and continued speaking. 'You were talking about the baby. I'm sure it'll be a girl.
Now, as soon as she' s born…' 'He, perhaps,' said my mother bravely.
'Don' t be stupid, of course it' ll be a she.I'm going to send her to school,and educate her well.
I want to prevent her from making the mistakes I've made in life.'
Miss Betsey looked quite angry as she said this.
My mother said nothing,as she was not feeling at all well.
'But tell me, were you and your husband happy?
'asked Miss Betsey.
'Oh,I see.
'John looked at Mary.She was older than Wil-son—about thirty-five,perhaps—with short brown hair,and a pretty,friendly face.She was wearing a white coat with a lot of pens in the top pocket.She smiled at him kindly, but John felt miserable.
But where was Silas while this was happening?In the evenings he sometimes used to open his door and look out.He had some idea that his money would come back,or that some-one would come with information about the thief Tonight was New Year's Eve,and the villagers had told him to stay awake until midnight,because it would bring him good luck if he saw the beginning of the new year.So tonight he was more restless than usual.He opened his door several times during the evening,and stared out,but he saw and heard nothing in the silent,freezing night.The last time,as he was standing at the door,he had one of his fits,and stood there completely uncon-scions,holding the door open.
When he became conscious again,he closed the door and turned back to the fire.But when his shortsighted eyes looked at the floor in front of the fire,he seemed to see gold there!Gold—his own gold—taken and then brought back to him in the same strange way!His heart beat excitedly,and for a few moments he was unable to move.At last he reached out his hand to touch the gold,but instead of hard,metal coins his fin－gers felt soft,warm curls.
The villagers came out of their houses and followed me down the hill.A young man looked at John Law carefully.
Full Moon in Full Squat
How many minutes had I been in here already?
At least fifteen.
Next morning after breakfast we asked Magwitch to tell us more about his past life,so that we could protect him better.
I was happier than I had felt for months.I knew I had done the right thing,and now there would be no second monster to follow the first.
'Very well,Mr King.Thank you,you can go now.
'Albert left the room.
'Well,he can't have it,'Herbert laughed.
'It's our paw now and we're going to be rich and happy.Come on, Father.Make a wish!'
That evening Elizabeth could not help telling Jane her news.
However,she almost regretted doing so,when she saw the astonishment on Jane's face.At first Jane could not believe that her sister was engaged to a man she had so disliked,and she wondered if Elizabeth could really be happy with him.But when she had been convinced by Elizabeth's explanations and promises,she was delighted,and congratulated her sister with all her heart.
'I will,'answered Nancy coldly.She was still sure she would not marry him,but she wanted to remain polite.
As time went by, Mr Utterson became calmer and more atpeace with himself.
He was truly sorry that his client, SirDanvers Carew, was dead, but he was also very glad that MrHyde had disappeared.
As for Doctor Jekyll, he too appearedcalmer and happier.He came out into the world again.He invited friends to his house and accepted invitations to theirs.
Hehad always been a good and generous man.Now,however,hebecame a churchgoer too.
He was busy, he spent a lot of timein the fresh air and he looked happy and carefree.For morethan two months he was at peace with himself and the world.
'Where were you before you came here?
'he asked.
"You do if you don't want to get blisters.
Which will most likely happen since I didn't have time to break them in, seeing as someone so kindly just bought them for me and disposed of my already broken in and highly comfortable Spring-Zs—"
So we did things for him,and he liked it.
But the old man spoke very little and he looked unhappy,too.After a time he said,'You know,Bridgewater,I, too, have a secret.
'And he began to cry.
'But that's not possible,'the Archbishop replied. 'You know what the Church thinks about marriage and divorce.
Di－vorce is wrong in the eyes of God!'
There you dream that a very large animal has suddenly sat down on you.You wake up and you understand that something terrible has happened.At first,you think that the world has ended.Then you think that this cannot be true.So it must be thieves,or murderers,or fire.No help comes,and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you,and you cannot breathe.
Dear Peter,——I have received your twoletters of December the 30th and April the 18th,and am very happy to find by them,as well as byletters from Mr.Wythe,that you have been sofortunate as to attract his notice and good will;Iam sure you will find this to have been one of themost fortunate events of your life,as I have everbeen sensible it was of mine.I enclose you a sketchreading,which submit to his correction.Many ofthese are among your father's books,which youshould have brought to you.As I do not recollectthose of them not in his library,you must write tome for them,making out a catalogue of such asyou think you shall have occasion for,in eighteenmonths from the date of your letter,andconsulting Mr.Wythe on the subject.To thissketch.I will add a few particular observations：
'Adai!You never stop talking about Adai.What can he do?
'Rilla said.She felt angry.
Diane put the phone down.
'It isn't true,Roger!Mother dead!Daddy died last winter,and now Mother.
'Diane began to cry.
WHO BRAVELY GAVE HIS LIFE
Just then I noticed the housekeeper putting a dish on the table.I stared at her.I had seen exactly such eyes,and such hands,very recently!And suddenly I was absolutely certain that this woman was Estella's mother.
The man looked at me angrily.
'Well, you can't, ' he said.
'The shop's closing now.
You can come back tomorrow. '
They don't pay me much, but I'm looking about me for a good opportunity.
They turned into a smaller road,and soon came to the school.Inside,in the long,cold,silent classroom,a lonely boy sat reading near a small fire.When he saw his poor forgotten past self,Scrooge sat down at one of the desks,put his head in his hands and cried.
It seemed strange to return from our week's holiday and to find myself in my own small house with Dora.
It was difficult to believe that we were going to spend the rest of our lives together.
But soon I realized that married life was not as comfortable as it appeared.
Neither Dora nor I knew anything about managing the house.
We had a servant, of course, who managed us.
She served our meals late, drank all our wine,and stole all our silver spoons.
When she finally left, we had another who behaved in a similar way.
I felt I had to speak to Dora about it.
' I was going to,but I saw in the newspaper the next morn- ing that he had died.'
"Does it have to do with prison?"
For several days after Tess's arrival,Clare,sitting reading a book,hardly noticed she was there.But one morning at breakfast he was reading music and listening to the tune in his head,when he heard a musical voice which seemed to become part of his tune.
He looked round at Tess, seated at the table.
'What are you studying,Uriah?
'I asked politely.
'And his wife and child.
Yes. '
Buff was screaming and the whites of his eyes were showing.He fell on the ground and water ran out of his mouth.He was crazy.I remembered the way I had gone crazy when I first came into the Star Zoo.
It was seeing the animals.
It was the Book of Remembering coming to life.It made people go crazy.
Dunstan's excitement made him forget that the weaver could still be alive.He wanted Silas to be dead,and he wanted Silas's money.He looked round the cottage again.There was very little furniture,just a bed,the loom,three chairs and a table.Dunstan looked under the bed,but the money was not there.Then he noticed a plsce on the floor,near the loom,where the floorboards looked different.By pulling up one of the boards,he discovered Silas's hiding－place.He took out the two heavy bags filled with gold,put the boards back and hurried to the door.
'That's it.It must have been Grace Poole.You've guessed it.I shall consider what to do about it.But meanwhile I'm glad you're the only person who knows anything about all this Say nothing to anybody else,and now,go back to your own room.
'My bride!I have no bride!
'he answered.
'But I will have one,and you must stay!'
Then finally, finally, we returned to The Golden Lotus.
The thing turned its long eyes to look at her. '
Does she always say stupid things?
'it said.
Hee-Haw's head touched the ground.Hoo－Woo's head touched the ground too.I understood.This was their God!I understood because I felt the same fear as they did.
'What prints did you see by the moor gate?'
Roger Nowell stood up and walked across the room to the door.
'James Device, come in.
We want to question you.'
I was sorry for him.
'Isn't is boring?
'I asked.
"You wouldn't catch me 'recycling'—even if I were a guy."
The day passed happily as they travelled over green hills and along narrow country roads.
But the next morning the Rat and the Mole got Toad out of bed and made sure that he did some of the work.
Because of this, Toad said very little about a pleas ant easy life.
Later, he even tried to get back into bed, but the Mole and the Rat pulled him out again.
' Oh,don't be so stupid!
'It's your fault.You made me sit there.You did it to annoy me!
Here,take the food!'
"It is a Ritz-Calton.
The Golden Lotus is the next stop," said Henry Lee, Sr., as he assisted an elderly Korean engineer out of the van and steered him toward the entrance.
Hanks followed him, carrying the engineer's suitcase.
'Don't touch my arm, hold on to my waist!
'he shouted.
At the top of another hill he said,laughing,'Put your arms around me again, my beauty!'
I was taken to see the King,but had to wait for at least an hour while he struggled with a difficult mathematical question.However,when he had finished,he spoke politely to me,and ordered his servants to show me to a room.For dinner they gave me three kinds of meat—a square of beef,a triangle of chicken and a circle of lamb Even the bread was cut into mathematical shapes in the evening a teacher arrived to help me learn the language,and in a few days I was able to make conversation with the island people.
'Look,madam!
'I cried to Catherine,who was passing through the kitchen.
'That devil Heathcliff told you he could never love Miss Isabella!And now he's kissing her!'
While I was eating,a platform had been prepared to carry me.The people of Lilliput,known as the Lilliputians,are very intelligent and clever with their hands.For me,five hun-dred men built a special wooden platform with twenty－two wheels.Nine hundred of the strongest men worked for about three hours to lift me on to the platform,and one thousand five hundred of the King's largest horses（each eleven and a half centimetres high）pulled me to the capital.I did not know about any of this,because they had put a sleeping powder in my wine, and I was in a deep sleep.
'I'm so frightened tonight I can hardly breathe .'
'Yes,ma'am,'I said.
The theatre was crowded and noisy,but when Sybil Vane appeared,everyone became silent.She was one of the most beautiful girds that Lord Henry had ever seen.'Lovely!Lovely!
'he said softly.
'It's lucky we've found out about your noble blood,Tess.Do you know there's a very rich lady called Mrs d'Urberville living on the other side of the wood?
She must be our relation.You must go to her and claim relationship with her,and ask for same help in our trouble.'
I haven't seen Cathy since then.Once I went to the Heights to visit her,but I was not allowed to see her.About six weeks ago I had a long conversation with Zillah,the housekeeper,who gave me news of Cathy.It appeared that,when she ar rived at the Heights,she did her best to look after her sick husband.He was obviously dying,although Heathcliff refused to call the doctor.Only a few weeks after her arrival,Linton died in the night,with only Cathy by his bedside.Heathcliff inherited all of Linton's,and what had been Cathy's,fortune,so Cathy is now very poor.
'Were there any sheep in the palace gardens?'
asked Cyril.
'OK,here!
'shouted Simon.Christine turned the boat to-wards the wind,and Susan caught hold of the post.Then Si- mon and Peter climbed out of the boat into the water.
'He was a lot of trouble to you,madam,'Mr Wopsle said sympathetically to my sister.
"Hey, little lady.
You dropped your money belt," said a husky male voice with a slight twang.
During the next few weeks,however,I noticed Cathy's behaviour change.She was always writing on little pieces of paper,which she kept in a locked drawer in her room,and every morning she got up surprisingly early to go down to the kitchen.I suspected something,and day I decided to break open her drawer.In it I was horrified to find a whole pile of love letters from Linton.The two cousins had been writing to each other in secret for several weeks,and Cathy had used the milkman as a messenger.I told her at once that I knew her secret,and made her promise not to send or receive any more letters.We burnt Linton's letters together.
'A man with one leg?
'he asked, fear in his voice.
I was born in Switzerland, in the town of Geneva.
Anyway,this time it was George who towed us on to Penton Hook.There we discussed the important question of where to spend the night.We had decided to sleep on the boat.There-fore we could stay there,or we could go on past Staines.In the end,we decided to continue to Runnymede.
'Can I do nothing to help you?'
asked Lucie sadly.
It was a hard day's journey, up the Dyea Canyon and into the mountains.
They camped that night at Lake Bennett.Here there were thousands of gold miners.They were building boats to sail up the lake when the ice melted in the spring.Buck made his hole in the snow and slept well, but was woken up very early and harnessed to the sledge.
The first day they had travelled on snow that had been hardened by many sledges and they covered sixty kilometres.
But the next day, and for days afterwards, they were on new snow.
The work was harder and they went slowly.
Usually, Perrault went in front,on snowshoes, flattening the snow a little for the dogs.Francois stayed by the sledge.
Sometimes the two men changed places, but there were many small lakes and rivers,and Perrault understood ice better.
He always knew when the ice across a river was very thin.
I thought,' Yes,I could do that.But I know that he doesn't love me, and despite that, he asks me to marry him!
'So I said,
'And got into a field of young clover!
'said Laban Tall.
'Yes,'I answered.
'I'm telling you the truth.'
And I did not like to hear Rupert call me a play-actor.
The kids all giggled.
'Well,I advise you to work hard,and hot to look back into your past.If something which we know is wrong tempts us,then we must make every effort to avoid it,by putting our energy to better use.A year ago I too was very miserable,because I was bored by the routine life of a country vicar,and I was tempted to change my profession.But suddenly there was light in my darkness,and God called me to be a missionary.No profession could be greater than that!Since that moment of truth,I have been perfectly happy,making my preparations for leaving England and going abroad in the service of God.Happy,that is,except for one little human weakness,which I have sworn to overcome.'
'We are taking you to Mr Kerwin,the judge.He wants to ask you some questions about the murder of a man here last night,'one of the men told me.
'Good morning, Gordon,'the King said. 'How nice to see you again.
And what can I do for you?'
'Me?Our noble relations?We haven't any.Whatever put that into your head?'
I wore the blue baseball cap with my hair tucked up into it and Hanks's mirrored aviator sunglasses.
I was taking no chances.
Fortunately, none of the backpackers on board looked familiar—nor did any of them give me a second glance.
In the afternoon,we were harnessed to the carriage and La－dy Gray came out and looked at us.She was a tall,proud-look-ing woman and did not look pleased,but she said nothing and got into the carriage.
I intended to have written you from Kirkcudbright,the town I shall be in tomorrow——but Iwill write now because my Knapsack has worn mycoat in the Seams, my coat has gone to the Taylorsand I have but one coat to my back in these parts.I must tell you I went to Liverpool with George and our new Sister and the Gentleman,my fellow traveller, through the Summer andAutumn—— we had a tolerable journey to Liverpool——which I left the next morning beforeGeorge was up for Lancaster.——Then we setoff from Lancaster on foot with our Knapascks on,and have walked a Little zig zag through themountains and lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland—— We came from Carlisle yesterday to this place——We are employed ingoing up Mountains, looking at strange towns,prying into old ruins and eating very heartybreakfasts.Here we are full in the Midst ofbroad Scocth"How is it a'wi yoursel"——the Girls are walking about bare footed and in theworst cottages the smoke finds its way out of thedoor.——Mr.
Abbey says we are Don Quixotes——tell him we are more generallytaken for Pedlars.All I hope is that we may not betaken for excise men in this whiskey country.Weare generally up about 5 walking before breakfastand we complete our 20 miles before dinner.——Yesterday we visited Burn's Tomb and thismorning the fine Ruins of Lincluden.——I haddone thus far when my coat came back fortified atall points——so as we lose no time we set forthagain through Galloway——all very pleasant andpretty with no fatigue when one is used to it——We are in the midst of Meg Merrilies' country ofwhom I suppose you have heard.
'Let me ask you something,'said the lawyer.
'Sir DanversCarew was my client, but you are my client too,and I want toknow what I'm doing.You haven't tried to hide the murderer, have you?'
'The horse has been down and thrown him!
'said Robert.He tried to lead me forward but I almost fell again.
'He's bad in the foot,too.No wonder he went down,riding over these stones without a shoe!Reuben was drunk,Ned.He would nev－er ride a horse without a shoe unless he was drunk.'
Although there was another hour before the sun went down,we suddenly heard the sound of the ship's gun.
It  took a while for GG to fully comprehend the situation.
She paced our room in her bare feet, her baggy fisherman's pants making swooshing sounds, running her fingers through her disheveled hair and fingering her jade nose hoop.
When she finally faced me, she said, "Well, I'm glad you're okay.
You're lucky Hanks had his wits about him."
'It's no more than you deserve,'was the answer every time.
Then I was taken to the room where the dead body lay.How can I tell you what I felt when I saw the body?I put my arms round it and cried：'What have I done?
My friend!My dear friend!
'The body was Henry Clerval's,and so now I had destroyed another person.
'I will!
I'm no thief or murderer!
'I replied bravely.
Charlotte held my hand.As we left our rooms,we met a postman.
'It is.And now I want to ask you a question.What do youintend to do with the locket?'
'I don't advise it,'said Blantyre. 'She's too easily fright－ened for a lady to ride.'
'Eee－Eee is a squirrel,'the computer said.
'Cheep-Cheep is a bird.Animals take care of you.'
He thought for a moment,and then spoke in a softer voice.
'But I got yon,Nancy,and yet I've been wanting something different all the time Perhaps from now on I'll be able to ac－cept our life better,and we'll be happier.
'The following spring,there was a wedding in Raveloe.The sun shone warmly as Eppie walked through the village towards the church,with Silas,Aaron and Dolly.Eppie was wearing the beautiful white wedding dress she had always dreamed of,which Nancy Cass had bought for her.She was walking arm in arm with her father,Silas.
I know exactly what I'm doing."
"The M16 sounds finger-lickin' good."
'A careless girl!
'said Mr Brocklehurst quietly,almost to himself'The new girl,I see.
I must not forget to say something to the whole school about her. 'and then to me,aloud,
'Do you know Dickon?
'asked Mary.But just then the robin flew away.
'Oh look,he's flown into the garden with no door!
Please,Ben,how can I get into it?'
The Doctor had written, Charles is safe, but I cannot leave this place yet.
Take Defarge to Lucie.
Mr Churchill came over and put his hand on the King's arm.Edward looked up.
'Thank you,Winston,'he said.
'You were a good friend to me.'
'The House of Usher itself,'he told me,'is like a living thing.When the walls were first built,life went into the stones themselves and year after year it has grown stronger.Even the air around the walls and above the lake has its own life,and belongs to the house.Don't you see,'he cried,'how the stones and the air have shaped the lives of the Usher family?'
'Did Mr Briggs write to Mr Rochester?
'I asked.
After a short argument, which Carton won, Barsad followed him to Mr Lorry's office.
The charity－boy looked at him fiercely.
'You'll be needing a coffin soon,Workhouse,if you make jokes like that!
I'm Mister Noah Claypole,and you're working under me.Now,hurry up and open the curtains!
'As he said this, he kicked O liver and entered the shop.He was a big,clumsy boy of about fourteen, with a large head and very small eyes.Added to the se attractions were a red nose and dirty yellow trousers.
Johansen laughed angrily.
'That's stupid,'he said.
'Perhaps the motor sledges can go all night,but the Englishmen can't.The English can't win,Roald—they don't understand snow,but we do.And they're too slow.'
'Who? 'I asked.
'Oh, yes, Your Majesty, yes! 'said Merrick. 'I'm a very happy man!
I have a home here now, and friends, and my books. I'm happy every hour of the day! '
I decided to leave Geneva for ever.I took all the money that I needed,and left the town.Before I left,I went to visit the place where William,Elizabeth,and my father lay at rest.I stood there and promised them that I would stay alive until I had killed the monster.
On the fifth morning Zillah came into the room.She was surprised and pleased to see me,and told me the villagers all thought Cathy and I had got lost on the moors,and died,four days ago.I ran out of the room to look for Cathy.
'You see, Mole, it's really not a good idea to come here alone.
We river bankers always come in twos or threes, if we have to come here.
Of course, if you're Badger or Otter, then there's no problem. '
Bould de Suif timidly looked at the four dignified ladies and gentlemen who were still fasting and spoke haltingly;
'She was brought here last night,'replied the old woman.
'She was found lying in the street.
She'd walked some distance,judging by her shoes,which were worn to pieces.Where she came from,where she was going to,or what her name was,nobody knows.'
The people in the street came close to the coach and looked to the coach and looked at the Marquis with stony, silent faces.
The Marquis looked back at them in bored dislike.
To him, they were no more than animals.
"But—"
I kept food and tools at both my houses,and also wild goats.
There were many goats on the island,and I made fields with high fences to keep them in.
They learnt to take food from me,and soon I had goat's milk to drink every day.
I also worked hard in my cornfields.
And so many years went by.
John Heminges of the Queen's Men taught us both a lot.He was a good friend,then and for many years.
I learned my lesson from this, and opened a new bank account in the name of Hyde. I even gave Hyde a different handwriting.
I was sure I was safe-but I was wrong.
6 The Queen's game of croquet
'I will,'I said.
His eyes shone as he spoke of his great purpose in life,and I was listening,fascinated,so neither of us heard the light footsteps approaching the cottage along the grassy path.
'That's all right,that's all right,'Gog said quickly.And then he looked up,first at Rilla and then at Kiah.His eyes were cold and green.
'I know about you two,'he said.
'Your captain told me about you.You're famous!Two children!You want to help planet Earth,is that right?
'He waited.The cat jumped on to his table and sat down in front of the television.
'Yes, my poor sister, to the last. '
"Who do you know?"
York came to me first and made the rein very tight.Then he went to Ginger.But the moment he took off the rein in order to shorten it,she stood up on her back legs.York and the groom could not control her.She kicked herself out of the car－riage and fell down,kicking me on the leg as she went.York sat on her head to keep her still and shouted,'Let the black horse out!Undo the carriage!Cut the harness! '
That winter,at Dawson,Buck did something that made him even more famous in the north.It was also very helpful to the three men.They wanted to make a journey to look for gold in the east,and they needed money.They were in a bar one day when some of the men started to talk about dogs.One man said that he had a dog who was strong enough to pull a sledge with two hundred kilos on it.Another said his dog could pull two hundred and fifty.A third man,called Matthewson,said his dog could pull three hundred kilos.
Scudder was lying on his back.
There was a long knife through his heart,pinning him to the floor.
That night, alone in the room with the coffins,O liver cried bitter, lonely tears.
He did not sleep, and very early in the morning, before anyone was awake, he quietly unlocked the shop door and left the house.
He ran up the street and through the town as far as the main road,where he saw a sign that told him it was just seventy miles from the re to London.
The name London gave the boy an idea.That huge place!
Nobody, not even Mr Bumble, could ever find him the re!He had heard old men in the workhouse say it was a good place for brave boys,and that the re was always work the re for those that wanted it.It would be the best place for him.He jumped to his feet and walked forward again.
1 A surprise for the Cuthberts
'Come forward,Heathcliff!
'called Hindley.
'You may welcome Miss Catherine home,like the other servants.'
'Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for interfering?'
'Oh,it's you,is it?
'he says.
The Mole looked. Then he looked at his fried. 'It's a doors-craper. Why get excited about a door-scraper?'
Anne walked home with her head held high, but she felt strangely sad, and wanted to cry.
'That's true,'Sapt said.
'But you won't go,of course.They'll kill you!Duke Michael made her write this letter!'
'Is the fish all right?
'I cried.
The Queen of Hearts,she made some tarts,
"Cheap, very cheap!
Where want to go?"
'Enfield,'he said,'you're right about not asking toomany questions.However,I want to ask the name of the manwho walked over the child.'
'Why won't you be honest?
'Why have you brought me here again,if you don't want to see me?My father's very ill and I should be with him.'
'I said that our waste products don't make the river water dangerous.We've tested them very carefully for many years,and if they are diluted in water,they are not dangerous at all.There are usually only one and a half parts per million in the river water,that's all.And the seals aren't in the river.They're out at sea.I wrote that in my letter,and I'll say the same thing at the Enquiry next week.'
'Oh well, I must try some, 'laughed the vicar's wife.
But after the first mouthful there was a very strange look on her face.
But Xury was happy to help me.
'I'll go all over the world with you,'he cried.
'You may be robbed or murdered in London. But that may happen to you anywhere, if there is any profit in it for the criminal.'
'Mr Holmes,I need your help and advice.Something very strange and frightening has been happening.'
She broke off,for fear of being rebuffed.Loiseau took the cue.
My hand began to shake badly,and I dropped the letter on the floor.As I picked it up,I could see only one word—dead ...If your daughter Maria does not come home soon,she will be dead.
From that day onwards the situation worsened.I neededlarger and more frequent doses in order to stay in Jekyll's body.The pains came unexpectedly,but most of all when Iwas asleep.I was afraid to go to bed,or even to sleep for afew moments in my chair.If I did so,I always woke as Hyde.
I moved closer to the baggage claim conveyor belt to scrutinize every suitcase chugging by.
There was a lake next to the house and I rode my horse up to the edge and stopped.Perhaps from here the house would not seem so sad,so full of gloom.I looked down into the mirror of dark,still water,and saw again the empty,eye-like windows of the house and the dying trees all around it.The feeling of gloom was stronger than ever.
" I know your answer, my dear,the husbandsaid.
'Well,a Struldbrug is a human being who will never die,but will live for ever.If a Luggnuggian baby is born with a round spot above its left eye,which never disappears,it's a Struldbrug.We have over a thousand of them in the country.'
'One of the biggest in Europe,'Harris answered.
'You destroyed the life of Sybil Vane,'answered the sailor,'and Sybil Vane was my sister.She killed herself because of you.I've been looking for you for years, but I only knew the name that she used to call you—Prince Charming.Well,tonight I heard your name,and tonight you're going to die.'
The particulars of our journey,I mustreserve,to be communicated after my return.Itwould take a volume to describe the whole.It hasbeen upon the whole an agreeable jaunt.We havehad opportunities to see the world,and to formacquaintances with the most eminent and famousmen in the several colonies we have passed through.We have been treated with unboundedcivility,complaisance,and respect.
'Please don't tell anyone in the village that you've seen me,'begged the girl.
'I'm rather poor,and I don't want anyone to know about me. '
Her thin arms trembled in the cold.
'I said,"When can you start?
",Mr Duncan.We need you in our factory as soon as possible.Will Monday be OK?'
No one came along the road. Nothing happened.
I watched Mary, unhappily.
'Yes,if Darcy doesn't put it off again.'
He found Pete,killed in his bed.
He followed Thornton's smell to a deep pool,and found Skeet lying dead by the edge.Thornton's body was somewhere under the water.
'Your brother?Commander Adai?
'But you didn't tell me that!'
Slowly I became calmer among the beautiful mountains.
I learnt to sleep again, and for days I did not see anybody.
Then one morning I saw a figure coming towards me faster than any man could go.
It jumped easily over the rocks and I saw with horror the monster that I had created.
On his face was a look of deep sadness, but also of evil.
At first I could not speak be－cause I hated him so much.
But at last I said：
'Laurie and his grandfather would care,'said Meg,'and we would all be very sorry if anything happened to you.'
Of course,he knew what I would do.I put my hands behind my back.Quickly,his left hand moved towards me.In it he held a dagger and it was coming straight at my heart!I jumped to one side,and the dagger went deep into my shoulder.Before my friends could do anything,Rupert of Hentzau was on his horse and galloping through the trees.I heard my men going after him with their guns and then everything went black.
'Are you awake,Jane?
'asked the voice I had been expecting.
Amber wiped her chin and pointed to Laurel.
After Dorian had gone,Lord Henry smiled to himself.How amusing it was to watch this young man,he thought.He was very different now from the frightened boy in Basil Hallward's house.He had opened like a flower in the sun,and was learning to enjoy every pleasure in life.
'And it is I,'thought Lord Henry,'who have taught him how to do this.'
He was away for three weeks.Cathy did not cause me any trouble at first.She spent her days walking her dogs and riding her pony in the large garden.But one day she asked if she could stay out the whole day,and away she went on her little pony,with her two dogs running behind.
"Oh,dear,might I offer…?"
' Yes, I wish you'd come out,'Anthea said.
When we arrived opposite the first island, we shouted, but there was no answer.So we went to the second island, and we tried there.The result was the same.
'Well, Huck,' he began.
'Old Miss Watson wanted to sell me.
A man came into town and told Miss Watson that he'd buy me for eight hundred dollars.She couldn't say no, so I ran away.I ran down to the river to hide,but everybody in the town was there.
They said you were dead, Huck.I had to wait all day to get away.When it was dark,I got on to a big boat and hid.
When we came near this island, I jumped into the water and swam here.'
'So nothing has turned up for him yet?And what abut the money you lent him,Traddles?'
Now the school had disappeared,and they were in the middle of a busy town,with shadowy crowds and carts all around them.Here it was Christmas time again,but it was evening, and there were lights in the shops and streets.
After we had done that,we sat there and we looked at it.
"but there's nothing in here."
Old Mr White did not look at the money in his hand. Slowly he stood up and looked at the stranger, afraid. 'How much?'
Mr White asked, very quietly.
He did not want to hear the answer.
I began to laugh.
Just then they saw that the Psammead was sitting behind them, and was watching them!
Just then a voice called out from the trees behind us. 'Fritz!Fritz!Where are you,man?'
'But the man is dangerous,'said Sir Henry.
'He'll do any- thing.Nobody is safe until he is in prison again.We must tell the police.'
Maw and Meggins had a big factory and Herbert White worked there on the machinery.
Mr Bennet had hardly spoken up to now,but he thought it was time to enter the conversation.
'You seem very fortunate in your patron,Mr Collins,'he said.
"Cheer up.
The old geezer thinks you're a looker—"
I heard about the plane crash on television.At first, I did not think about my father.Then I remembered he was flying back from Sydney on that day.
'To get her out of my lovely bride's way?A very sensible suggestion.But what about you?'
'I see,'said Colin slowly.
Biddy looked at me,interested.
'That wasn't a true or polite thing to say. Who said it?'
Forget it.
Come and have a drink. '
'Go home, you horrible child, 'said another woman.
It was a morning's walk to Queensferry,Which was west of Edinburgh,but we did not say a word to each other on the way.Suddenly,at the top of a hill,we could see the Firth of Forth below us,blue and calm,with white sails on it.
'Oh no you won't!
'She pulled her hand sharply away.
'Now discover my name,'she added,laughing,and left.
'He must be a very nice animal, 'said the Mole, as he got into the boat and took the oars.
'I'm not sure at the moment, 'Alice said gently.
'May Ilook round first?'
'Keep them off the boats!
'cried the doctor.
'Well,perhaps we'll discover more later.
One of you can go and tell Mr Boldwood what Billy says.
Now,men,I hope I can trust you all to do your work well for me.
Goodnight. '
Don't look at me, I wanted to say, the culprit is the silver-haired delinquent in the mollusk hat!
'I don t know anything about love!
'said Jo.

For a moment Mr Utterson hesitated,wondering and worrying.At last he put his thoughts into words. 'Why did youlook at the two letters together? 'he asked.
'I do,'said scrooge.
'Why do you call it"merry"Christmas?You're too poor to be merry.'
'Ah,yes,sir,I do!You must confess it is a sad business for my poor girls.'
'I never said it would. '
Smiling,he put his hands on my shoulders.
'I wish I could be as good as you!David,promise me that if anything ever happens to separate us,you'll think of me at my best!Promise me that!'
A few moments later,she stood beside the uncovered coffin. Staring in,she said,'It was best to know the worst,and I know it now!
'Her tears fell fast beside the dead pair in the coffin,tears for Fanny and for herself.
Although Bathsheba,not Fanny,had married Troy,in death Fanny was the winner.
She was taking her revenge now on Bathsheba for the difficulties she had experienced in her life.
'That's Madame Antoinette de Mauban.She's travelling on the same train as you,but don't fall in love with her.'
Mary was standing in the middle of her room when they opened the door a few minutes later.The two men jumped back in surprise.
'Why not?'
I got up ,went across the room and stood in front of Mr Nowell.'
I'm afraid of my mother,' I began.'
I'm afraid be-cause she' s a witch and she can kill people.'
'You can't trust him!
'added Jacob darkly.
'You know I don't love you,'answered Tess. 'In fact,I love somebody else.'
'Well,'Sapt informed us,'I've arranged a dance at the royal palace this evening,for the Princess.'
"Oh, she's up to something.
'Do you have "plans",Mother?
'asked Meg.
And then George fell,and he caught hold of the glass case to save himself.It came down, with George and the chair on top of it.
The breakfast things were all ready on the table, and the Mole and the Rat quickly got to work.
The Rat made the coffee while the Mole fried several pieces of bread and an enormous number of eggs.
The train journey lasted all day,and it was dark when they arrived at the station.Then there was a long drive to get to the house.It was a cold,windy night,and it was raining heavily.
After a while Mary began to hear a strange,wild noise.She looked out of the window,but could see nothing except the darkness.
I told Holmes everything Mrs Lyons had said.
O liver lay on the ground, covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth, and looked wildly at all the faces surrounding him.
At that moment a policeman arrived and took O liver by the collar. 'Come on, get up, 'he said roughly.
'Well,I won't go there again,'said Alice.
'What a stupid tea-party it was!
'Just then she saw a door in one of the trees.
'How curious!
'she thought.
'But everything is strange today.I think I'll go in.'
I blew my whistle.
'I see.Oh,give me my hat,please.It's over there.'
' Oh,how beautiful!'
she cried.
'Do I believe those words?Do I believe I am alive!'
I was afraid and I put my hands over my eyes.
I didn't want to see my mother' s ugly face.
The guards pulled my motherout of the room and the noise stopped.
But I was already out the door.
Albert sat down next to Roger Roger was Molly's son,her second child.He lived in Cambridge,in an expensive house.
'But I haven't got any! 'replied O liver, greatly alarmed.
'I haven't got a sister, either. I'm an orphan. I live in Pentonville. '
One day the aunt had the most terrible toothache.
It con tinued for three days.
Morning and evening Conradin put salt in front of his god.
In the end he almost believed that Sredni Vashtar himself had sent the toothache.
But he was a young keeper,and he was new to the job,so when he got into the maze,he could not find them.Then he got lost.From time to time,they saw him as he ran past,on the other side of the hedge.He shouted,'Wait there!I'm coming!'
I put on his blue hat and white coat,picked up the empty milk bottles,shut my door and went downstairs,whistling.
The monster's yellow eyes looked at me.
'I am the unhappiest creature in the world, but I shall fight for my life,' he said.
'I am bigger and stronger than you, but I will not start the fight.
I shall always be gentle to you because you are my king and creator.
You made me, and you should love me and be kind to me, like a father.
William and Justine died because you did not love me.
Why did you create me if you were not ready to love me?'
'Oh,no,'Tom answered.
'We're very nice to them, and they all love us, and they don't want to go home.'
Molly said nothing.Everyone began to eat.
'I will indeed send her soon,'murmured Mrs Reed to herself.
Then he pointed to a house by the river and said quietly,'Wait five minutes, then come to the back door.
'He walked
'I don't mind.It isn't my carpet,after all,'replied To－bermory.
'Yes, 'said Mrs Bumble.
'Something about the mother of O liver Twist. But first, how much will you pay me for the information? '
'Is he married or single?'
The blind man swore at them.
'he cried.
'They're listening to the music!
'thought Mary.
'I mustn't frighten them!
'She stood very still.
'I've been working all night to get our ricks covered.
Never worked so hard in my life!Yours are safe of course,sir?'
'So you don't believe me?
'I smiled.
'Sit where you are, Bill,' said the blind man.
'I can't see, but I can hear a finger move .Hold out your right hand.'
I knew then that I had to tell her… but just then she cried,'Here he is!Quick,hide!
'and she pushed me inside the house and behind the front door.Then her husband came in and she asked him,'Has he come?'
The book which I had picked up was The Sad,Mad Life of Sir Launcelot Canning.It was not really one of US her's favourite books,but it was the only one that I had near me,so I started to read it.It was a wild,fantastic story,but I hoped that my reading would make Usher calmer and less afraid.He listened to me,indeed,but with a kind of mad seriousness that I found frightening.
As we stood in silence,the doors suddenly opened and a strong wind filled the room.It blew out all the candles in the room and we were left in darkness.But in the few seconds before the candles went out,we noticed that a man had entered the room.He was about as tall as I was,and his face and body were hidden by a long cloak.As we stood in the darkness,we could feel him standing in the room.
'It's not true,Christine.Simon's information is wrong.'
Poole reached in his pocket and brought out a note.Thelawyer read it carefully.It said：'I am returning your chemicals,as they are impure and therefore useless.In the year18-you made up a mixture of chemical powders for DoctorHenry Jekyll.
Please search your cupboards for some more ofthe same mixture and send it to Doctor Jekyll AT ONCE.Thisis VERY IMPORTANT.'
Sincerely,
'They won't know it's only a pig in the river,'I said to myself.
'They'll think it's me.'
That Wednesday a letter also arrived for the young Vi comte de Chagny.He opened the letter,saw the name at the bottom, and smiled for the first time that day.
It just didn't make sense.
Having a daughter named Vassar not get into Vassar would be sacrilege.
Not to mention embarrassing. And it would disprove Mom's theory: If an applicant to Vassar, the elite women's college, was named Vassar in addition to having a stellar academic record, how could they possibly refuse her?
All her advance planning would be for nothing—and I'd be known as "that loser Vassar Spore who goes to State."
Sikes seized her arms roughly.
'The girl's gone mad!'
Godfrey Cass was waiting at the door for the only guest he cared about,Nancy Lammeter.Finally she arrived,sitting be hind her father on his horse,looking more beautiful than ever.Her lovely face blushed as she saw Godfrey come forward to lift her down from the horse.
'Why is he waiting for me?
'she thought.
'I thought I made it clear to him that I'll never mar－ry him.People say he leads a bad life,and I can't marry a man like that.'
'No,Miss Eyre,you are less than a servant,because you do not work,replied Miss Abbott.They both looked at me as if they strongly disapproved of me.
Florio laughed loudly.
'Lovers!You don't know Emilia Lanier!She's a bad woman,my friend,a bad woman.
'Now he spoke very quietly.
'For a time she was the friend of Lord Southampton.But not now.That is all finished.'
Uncle Scrooge wanted to thank them,but the spirit hurried him away.The ghost seemed much older now： his brown hair had become grey.
'Yes, 'the man replied.
'And there's a passenger who's waiting for you.
'Yes. One day I asked him if he knew Fanny's young man,and he said he knew him as well as he knew himself!'
'Then don't be sad,'he said.
'I'll be back from college in three years time, and then we'll go abroad,or on a nice trip somewhere.Wouldn't that cheer you up?'
'Den't be afraid,'I warned the King.
'Well,it's better for your health if I manage everything,fa ther,'said Priscilla.
'Then there's nothing for you to worry about.No,Nancy dear,we must go home now.
But you and I can have a walk round the garden while the servants are get ting the horses ready.
Then we must get back and wake everyone in Strelsau! 'I cried.
'We must catch Black Michael before he kills the King.'
'Oh,dear!'
said Jo.
'He's been good to Father, and nowyou'll let Meg marry him,if she wants to.'
To distract myself, I pulled out my Genteel Traveller's Guide to Cambodia.
I skimmed through the introduction—then realized we were moving!
"Thanks," I said, semi-muffled by the bandana.
"I don't know what I would have done—"
It is the best thing in my room, the very best, the most beautiful thing I have.
This is the first Christmas in my life, and my first Christmas present.
Perhaps I had a Christmas with my mother once, but I do not remember it.
I have my mother's picture too, and she is beautiful, like you.
But now I know many famous ladies and kind people like Dr Treves, and I am a very happy man.
I am happy too because I am going to see you in the New Year.
'Not strange;wonderful,'said Thornton.
David Wilson looked at him carefully.
His voice,when he spoke,was very quiet and hard.
'Listen to me,John.You're a very good scientist,and we're lucky to have you in this com-pany.But you're not a businessman, and I am.Look at this.
'He picked up a sheet of paper, and held it across the table for John to see.It showed how much money the compa-ny had.
'We borrowed ten million pounds last year, and we employed four hundred more people.Think how much that means to a small town like this!'
Does Grace Poole earn a lot,then?
asked one.
'What do you know about these tarts?
'said the King.
I wanted to question GG further on the "D", but simply didn't have the energy.
'Come with me,'said the Persian.They went quickly into Christine's dressing－room.The Persian closed the door and went to the big mirror on one wall.

The tenth floor of the Opera House was a dangerous place.There were hundreds of ropes going down to the stage below it was a long,long way down.
I had heard the word before, and knew it meant a cruel pun－ishment often used by pirates－leaving a man alone on some distant, empty island.
We finished eating our meal.Soon after,Greta Ross came into the kitchen.
"Excuse me, but what did you just do to your food?"
'You seem very clever with words,Sir,'said Alicepolitely,hoping to calm him.She was worried about himfalling off the wall.
'I don' t want to give you money,' the pedlar said.
He took his hat off.There was not much hair on his head.
'I don't like you and I don' t like your family.
A lot of bad women, you are,and your father was a bad man, too.'
'Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear, 'Fagin said, bowing politely.
'Why didn't you write, and say you were coming?
We'd have got something warm for supper. '
'"See here,"said the doctor doubtfully,"it isn't usual for aman to walk into an empty house at four in the morning andcome out with another man's cheque for nearly a hundredpounds."
"She did?"
She seemed surprised. "Althea?"
The dogs came back and sat down again at Diane's feet.
'Thank you a thousand times,' said the young woman, as Jerry helped her out of the cab.
'Jennet,bring the bottle!
We need more drink!
'shouted my mother.
He looked worried and unhappy.
'Can you keep a secret?A very important secret?'
The kedai proprietor gazed at me impassively as he tooth-picked his teeth.
I gulped down the rest of my Pepsi—without rice—and shakily opened my guidebook.
The print blurred before my eyes.
'Yes,you will go to heaven too,Jane.'
7 The Last Letter
'Yes,sir,he answered.
'You see,we've only just eaten our lessons for today,and it's made us feel rather sick.'
One by one, Hanks took off his bench-made 1940 Godings with their fancy red-and-white cutouts.
He gazed at them, rubbing his hand tenderly over the leather.
Then he handed them to the owner—who immediately pulled them on and strutted around like a rooster, chest out. Hanks grimly stripped off his socks and walked barefoot down the road toward the motorbike.
'The woman is mad!
'said the people,turning to look ather as she rushed past the m.
Harris and I finished the rest of the breakfast.Then we car-ried all our luggage into the road.We tried to get a taxi.Usual-ly taxis come along every three minutes.In fact,there are usu-ally too many taxis.However,that morning we waited twenty minutes for a taxi.A crowd of interested people collected to watch us.I think it was because we had so much luggage.There was a big suitcase,a small bag,two baskets,several blan-kets,some fruit in a brown paper bag,some pans,some umbrel-las and four or five coats and raincoats.After a very long time,a taxi arrived and stopped for us.We packed our things into it,kicked two of Montmorency's friends out of the taxi,and started on our holiday The crowd of peopel waved goodbye to us.
'They're frightened,'said Poole simply.No one elsespoke.A little servant girl began to cry.
When the spring came,they found,not the lost mine,but a lake in a wide valley.Through the shallow water the gold showed like yellow butter, and here their search ended.There was gold worth thousands of dollars in the lake,and they worked every day,filling bag after bag with gold.
3 My first impressions of school
We sailed ahead of the wind,the island moving past quickly.After my success,I was less sorry about deserting the stockade.There was only one thing that worried me.It was the way Israel Hands watched me at my work,a cold little smile on his face.
But I was wrong.
I understand that now.
All the Scots lords were afraid of Bothwell, and many of them were his ene-mies.
They had an army, and on 15th June,Bothwell and I rode out to fight them.
'Yes.My real name is James Duncan,and Mr and Mrs Duncan are my father and mother.Tony is my younger brother,and his wife, Lisa,is my secretary.It's she who's in hospital.'
'Master David knows how I love this girl,'continued old Daniel,'and my dearest wish was for her to have a good husband to take care of her.
And there's no one I trust more than Ham!He's only a rough sailor like me,but he's honest,and sincere,and I know she'll come to no harm while he lives!'
Ten years was a long time,Mary thought.She had been born ten years ago.She walked away,thinking.She had begun to like the gardens,and the robin,and Martha and Dickon and their mother.Before she came to Yorkshire,she had not liked anybody.
We exchanged looks.
I came back to Stratford one wet August evening.The house in Henley Street was strangely quiet,and I went round the back and up to Will's room—his writing room, we called it.He was just sitting there not doing anything,just sitting.
She was sitting downstairs,by an open window,enjoying the spring sunshine.Her appearance had changed since her illness,but there was a strange beauty in her pale face.She did not read or sew any more,but used to sit there silently, staring into the distance.Her eyes seemed fixed on something far away,something beyond normal sight.
'To Strelsau,sirto the coronation.'
'One day I'll explain to you why I keep her in my house.But tonight,go and sleep in Adele's room You'll be quite safe there.Just dream about our future!'
The weather was very stormy as I travelled through the night to Yarmouth.Several times the coach was almost knocked off the road by the wind and the rain.
By the time we arrived in Yarmouth, most of the local people were in the streets, afraid to stay in their houses, in case the roof or the chimney blew down.
Many women were crying, afraid for their husbands or brothers who were out fishing in their small boats.
The sea itself, with its huge waves crashing noisily on the beach, frightened us all very much.
'No,'said Doctor Jekyll.
'I don't care what happens toHyde.I was thinking of my own reputation… Anyway,here is the letter.'
Noah's eyes were wide with greed.
'I'm the right man forthis job.Who is she?'
Mrs March,the girls and Laurie were sitting together on a dull November afternoon when Hannah hurried into the room with a telegram Mrs March read it,then dropped it to the floor,her face white and her hands shaking.Jo picked up the telegram and read it to the others in a frightened voice.Mrs March：Your husband is very ill.Come at once.S.Hale,Blank Hospital,Washington.
'She has all the best of me without my bad side,and if she were yours,it would almost seem as if we were not separated by death.Well,I won't mention it again.'
"What do you expect me to wear at a party like that?"
'Yes,'she answered faintly.
'Jane,you are too sensitive.That was just a dream.
Don't think about it any more!
'he answered comfortingly.
Some days later,all four girls went on a picnic with Laurie and his tutor,Mr Brooke,and some other young people.Sallie Gardiner and her English friend,Miss Kate Vaughn,were among them.It was a sunny day and they had their picnic on a hill,under some trees.
'Married on Tuesday and today it's only Saturday,and he's gone away!What strange husbands you seem to find,Tess!'
8 Elizabeth Learns more about Darcy and Wickham
After dinner we went to our rooms.Before I got into bed,I looked out of my window A strong wind sang sadly as it bent the trees in front of the Hall.A half moon shone through the dark,flying clouds onto the wild and empty moor.
Perhaps these people were playing the same game.
A stupid man tries to look different;a clever man looks the same and is different.
That was a wonderful moment for the Mole and the Rat, when they heard the door close behind them, shutting out the Wild Wood.
They followed the Badger down long dark tunnels until they came into a large kitchen.
There was a bright fire, with comfortable armchairs round it, and a great wooden table with long seats.
I had been expecting this news for some time but it still came as a terrible shock.
19 Bathsheba and Gabriel
And an "E" made out of rubber bands taped to the last page—obviously the next clue GG was planning to give me.
'Jim?
'Tom said. 'But he's—'Then he stopped and thought.
'Right.I'll help,too,I'll make a really good plan.
'He looked very excited.
'Yes.'
'He's also handsome,'added her sister,'which makes his character quite perfect!But what did you think of his sisters?'
'But,my dear,your father can't spare the horses, I'm sure.They're needed on the farm, aren't they, Mr Bennet?'
After a few weeks,Mr Sowerberry decided that he liked O liver's appearance enough to train him in the undertaking business.O liver's permanent expression of sadness was very suitable,the undertaker thought,for collecting dead bodies from houses and accompanying the coffins to funerals.
'I understand that somebody's been very careless, leaving a door-scraper lying in the middle of the Wild Wood, for other people to fall over.
And when I get home----'
'Once,'said Poole,'I heard it weeping.'
'Smile, Edward,'the King said. 'You are happy!'
Although it was now early morning,the house was still in total silence,and so there were no witnesses to see Mason being helped downstalrs and put in the carriage.
Although she was deeply upset, Jane bravely tried to control her feelings.
'Do not worry,Lizzy,I shall be able to forget him in a while.
I have nothing to complain of, as he made no promises to me.
I just thought he cared for me, but I was wrong.
Luckily, no one is hurt except myself.'
'I'm going to talk to Gog about rain,I can tell you that.Earth needs rain：there was no rain last winter.Half of Australia has no water and my trees here are dying.Without rain,many people are going to die.Is Gog going to understand that?I don't know!'
Yikes.
Was I really as smug as I sounded on paper?
As she said this, Mr Darcy changed colour, but he listened without trying to interrupt her as she continued.
Charlotte and Branwell wrote about a country called Angria,while Emily and Anne wrote about a land called Gondal.The paple in those countries fought battles and fell in love, and wrote letters and poems.My children wrote these poems and letters,and they wrote books about Angria and Gondal.They drew maps of the countries,wrote newspapers about them, and drew pictures of the towns and people in their stories.They in－vented a new world for themselves.
'Not as much as I'd like, sir.'
Hanks pivoted around on the stool.
"Yes, sir."
Then to me: "Hello, Spore.
You made it. No more ear run-ins?"
While Basil painted,Lord Henry talked,and the young man listened.The words filled Dorian's head like music—wild,exciting music.What a beautiful voice Lord Henry has,he thought.They are only words,but how terrible they are!How bright and dangerous!You cannot escape from words.Dorian began to understand things about himself that he had never understood before.Why had he never seen himself so clearly,he wondered?
'But who could give trouble?'
asked the Mole.
A few days later I had another chance to help the King.
I was woken at midnight by the cries of hundreds of Lilliputians outside my house.
Then there was a glum pause. All of us trying to think of something positive to say.
And failing.
On Christmas Day little Anne looked lonely.She asked me about her sisters.
Intense pastel reds, blues, yellows and pinks dissolved into the horizon like Easter egg-dye tablets.
'Catherine's ill?
'he gasped.
'Shut the window,Ellen!Catherine!Why—'
They walked on,less turning her head occasionally to look at him.For her he was still perfection,despite his thinness and pale face.He was the one man who had loved her purely,and who believed in her as pure.Their arms around each other's waists,they walked through the woods on lonely footpaths,taking care not to meet anybody.They did not talk much,being content to be together at last.
'How do you feel now,Linton?
'she asked after a while.
'I'm sorry,I didn't mean to hurt you.'
'I wish you felt as ill as I do,you cruel thing!And I was better today,before you came!
'His voice was full of pity for himself.
Angel himself was at this moment riding across Brazil towards the coast.He had never completely recovered from the serious illness he had had when he first arrived.He was not as strong as before,and looked much older.The country had been a disappointment to him.Many farmers had come here from England hoping to make their fortune,and had died in the fields or on the roads.He knew now he could not farm here.
'It was your housekeeper,Mr Heathcliff,'I said,quickly putting my clothes on.
'And I'm angry with her myself!
No one can sleep in a room full of ghosts!'
'You see!
'he shouted. 'You can't do without me!Jump up onto my horse!
'Together we rode back to Thornfield.While he ate dinner,I sat quietly beside him.He looked closely at me.
We never discovered what had really happened.We asked Harris about it the next morning, but he said, 'What swans?
'And he seemed to think that George and I had been dreaming.
There was a sudden movement in the water near the bank. Something silvery shone for a second, then it was gone. And so was the Otter. The Mole looked down.
The Otter's voice was still in his ears, but the Otter had disappeared.
There was just a long line of bubbles in the river.
'What an extraordinarily wild animal!'
said Van Cheele as he picked himself up.
And then he remembered Cunning ham's words about a wild animal in his woods.
'I don't want to cause you sadness all your life.The river is down there.I can put an end to myself in it.I'm not afraid.'
Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the cap－tain soon put away his weapon and sat down like a beaten dog.
Soon after Dr Livesey rode away on his horse.
The captain was silent for the rest of the evening, and for many evenings after－wards.
Buck was near the camp now,and he could hear voices singing.Then he saw the body of Hans,lying on his face,with ten or fifteen arrows in his back.Buck was suddenly filled with a wild,burning anger.
'Not at all,Miss Bingley.In fact,I was just thinking what pleasure a pair of fine eyes can give.'
'Hannah says Mother can't leave Father and would only worry,'said Meg.
'She says Beth won't be sick long,and that she knows what to do,but it doesn't seem right.'
'Then why doesn't he write to me?
'mary asked.
'Does he want me to say here in an English prison?'
'Can't anyone help them?
'cried Scrooge.
'Your eyes,Jane,'he said,'are the eyes of a bird, a free,wild being：Even if I break your cage,I can't reach you,beautiful creature!You'll fly away from me.But you could choose to fly to me!Come,Jane,come!
'He let me go,and only looked at me.How hard it was to resist that look!
In Scott's camp,at Cape Evans,no one talked about Amundsen and no one worked hard.They had good food,and they played football on the snow.They wrote a newspaper—The south Polar Times—and read books.No one learnt to ski,no one worked on the motor sledges.Twice,men went for long jour-neys across the snow.They walked,and pulled the sledges themselves.Oates stayed at Cape Evans and looked after his ponies.
And an idea came to me.I would visit Ruritania.None of my family had ever been there.They preferred to forget all about the Lady Amelia.But I saw in the newspaper that,in three weeks,the new young King,Rudolf the Fifth,would have his coronation.It would be an interesting time to visit the country.
17 The Search for the Murderer
There on the bed was his unloved wife.He only looked at her for a moment, but for the rest of his life he never forgot her sad,tired face.
But the right moment never came.
Bathsheba had planned to stay at the party for only an hour,and she was in fact preparing to leave when Boldwood found her alone in an upstairs room.
CHAPTER THREE
In front of me, GG made a sound like a "harumph."
'I am that already,'he replied. 'You are all that matters in my life.'
"The comprehensive itinerary for the whole summer."
'And why do you want him?
'said my sister crossly.
Monks dressed in saffron and novices dressed in orange strolled by.
("Notice the novices, boys who live the monk lifestyle for a short period of time….")
'No,'said Tom.
'Your money's all there.Your Pop never came back.'
With shaking hands I flipped to the town of Siem Reap.
I knew where I was going.
That was something, at least.
There seemed to be a lot of very affordable hostels—
'All right,I agree,'I called.
'Open the door!'
Mrs May lie sighed.
'And she, I know, is very fond of you. But she herself may try to protect you, and refuse an offer of marriage frpm you, for your sake.
Remember that, Harry.
But now, I must go back and sit with her. '
"Junior, return this.
Tell them they have two hours to correct it before the opening night party or Mr. Sato will not pay for it."
On the same day that Bathsheba arrived home, Mr Boldwood went to apologize to her for speaking so violently the last time he had seen her.
He knew nothing of her trip to Bath,and supposed she had only been to visit Liddy.
But at her door he was told he could not see her,and he realized she had not forgiven him.
'No,'her husband replied.
He walked around the tents trying to find the other dogs.But, to his surprise, they had disappeared.
He walked around Perrault's tent,very, very cold, wondering what to do.
Sud-denly, the snow under his feet fell in, and he felt something move.
He jumped back, waiting for the attack, but heard on-ly a friendly bark.
There, in a warm hole under the snow,was Billee.
And you are with me.When I sit in the needle- point chair you made,you are there.When I raisemy eyes to the walls where your paintings hang,you are there.When I am at the table and gaze atthe doilies you embroidered,when I lie in bedunder the afghans you crocheted,when I dress fordinner and put on the gold bracelet and theearrings you made for me,you are there.Yourbooks line the shelves,your poems are there to beread over and over,your speaking eyes look out atme from the photograph on my desk.
About a week later I met Mr Jaggers by chance in the street,and he invited me to dinner that evening.Wemmick was there too.Mr Jaggers told me Miss Havisham wished to see me on business,so I said I would go the next day.
Gabriel thought that twopence did not seem worth bothering about, so he stepped forward.
'Here,'he said,handing the coins to the gatekeeper,'let the young woman pass. '
Phnom Penh did indeed have a different feeling from Siem Reap and Angkor.
It was hard to place my fingers on exactly what it was, per se.
A slight gloom.
But the locals seemed to go about their day like the locals in Siem Reap: Cafes and bars flourished; the souvenir hawkers and potential tour guides roamed in packs; land-mine-victim amputees begged outside hostels and guesthouses; giggling children in their white shirts skipped to and from school; mothers balanced babies along with vegetables, kindling, fabric, and rice on their vintage bikes.
'He is,madam,'replied Uriah,smiling unpleasantly.He showed us into the sitting-room,where I noticed two large paintings on the wall,one of a grey-haired gentleman and the other of a lady with a sweet,gentle face.Just then a gentle man entered the room,looking a little older than his picture.I soon discovered he was Mr Wickfield,my aunt's lawyer.
'Great Caesar,'I said,'how do you feel about your mur-derer,Brutus?'
'Pip,dear old boy, you knew her when she was a fine woman…'and he could say no more.
O liver was led away to a large room, where,on a rough hard bed,he cried himself to sleep.
'I must keep in good health,and not die,'I replied.
'Thank you,Sir.And you were a good King.'
'Oh, do stop being so silly, Toad!
'cried the Mole.
I ignored him.
They couldn't stop the machinery quickly. He was in there for a long time. And at first they couldn't get him out.He was… 'the man stopped. Then he said ,'Don't go to see him!'
'would the young ladles like to stay for supper?
'asked Hannah.
One day in January I had a free afternoon, as Adèle wsa ill,so I decided to walk to Hay,a village two miles away,to post a letter for the housekeeper.It was a bright,frosty day,and I was enjoying the fresh air and the exercise.Stopping on the lonely road,I watched the sun go down in the trees behind Thornfield,and then in the silence I heard a horse approaching.Suddenly there was a crash as the horse slipped and fell on the ice,bringing down its rider.I ran to see if I could help the traveller,who was swearing furiously as he pulled himself free of his horse.
'Why do you,a stranger,visiting me late at night,ask that question?
'I asked.And then suddenly I knew who he was!In spite of the years that had passed,I was sure he was my convict!
'Well,what is it?
'Mr White asked his friend.
'She is totally pure!
'he replied,and felt that he had to tell that lie,even if he went to hell there and then for it.
'He says I mustn't read or write, and I must wear glasses.
Then my head won't hurt.
But if I'm not very careful, I'll be blind in six months! '
"After the Pulitzer, then what?
Think big, Vassar."
That night he hit Wallis in the mouth.
She screamed and he hit her again.There was blood on her face and she was shaking like a leaf.'
Please, Winfield,'she said.
'I haven't read my letters today,'said Dorian slowly.
'Of course I am, 'said the Mole bravely. But his face looked sad. Poor Mole!
He thought that life in a caravan on the open road would be an exciting adventure.
The cry of 'Stop thief!
'always causes great excitement.
Everybody in the street stopped what They were doing and began to shout the mselves.
Many joined in the chase with enthusiasm and soon the re was a big crowd running after O liver.
'Mr Rochester,I will not be yours.
'Another pause.
But it was the last written entry that riveted me: Both our lives will be changed forever.
It's the end of my life as it's been.
'Then never mind the rest.There are few better things in nature than a pure country girl.'
'well, perhaps the children's home didn't have any boys, so they sent you a girl, 'answered the stationmaster carelessly. 'Here she is. '
The captain jumped to his feet with a knife in his hand ,but the doctor never moved .He spoke to the captain in a calm and clear voice so that others in the room could hear:
Agnes smiled miserably.
'My poor father has no choice.You know how unhappy he has often been?And of course you've seen him drinking.You see,he loved my mother very much,and when she died,he didn't care so much about his work.That's when he started drinking.Uriah's very clever—he knows all this,and he's been very useful to Father,doing all the work that Father had forgotten or didn't want to do.Father really needs Uriah now,to keep his business going.And Uriah himself pretends to be humble and grateful,but in fact he's in a strong position,and is insisting on becoming a partner.Father is ashamed of himself,but he has to agree.Poor Father!I'd do anything to help him,any thing!
'And Agnes sobbed bitterly.
'OK,'the taxi driver shouted. 'What are you going to do next?Drive my taxi into the river?'
Not quite what I pictured, but I'd recognize that bombastic voice anywhere.
'Well,to tell the truth,my man's thrown me out.'
We were half-way through when I heard a sound that filled my heart with fear ;the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick on the frozen road.
Then it knocked against the inn door and we did not breathe .But then the tapping started again and slowly died away.
'His name's Mason,sir,and he comes from the West Indies.
At six o'clock,Beth put a pair of slippers by the fire to warm and Meg lit the lamp.Amy got out of the comfortable chair without bing asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was and held the slippers closer to the fire.
'Zadak looked at Kiah and then at Rilla with his blue eyes.
'I'm not talking to Gog again.And you—Gog isn't going to listen to you.Be careful—and good luck!'
'Miss is just a selfish child,sir!You'd better ride home and forget her!'
Kiah and Rilla sat down.There was a big window in Captain Seru's room.Kiah looked out of the window at the dark sky.He saw the Moon.It was cold and white in the dark sky.
'It was an accident,' Monsieur Armand said angrily. 'Or Buquet killed himself.'
"Promise.
I'll even throw in some clues.
A clue every day or so.
To make it sporting.
How does that sound.
Fair?"
Catherine's dead body lay peacefully on her bed.In death she looked more beautiful that in life.I wondered if she was now beyond us all,'as she had said,and hoped that her soul had found a home with God.
'Not in Europe,Jane,where I spent ten long years looking for an ideal.I tried taking mistresses,like Celine,the French dancer.But finally,bitter and disappointed with my wasted life,I returned to Thornfield on a frosty winter afternoon.And when my horse slipped and fell on the ice,a little figure appeared and insisted on helping me.In the weeks that followed,I began to depend on that bird－like little figure for my happiness and new interest in life.'
'Thank you,sir,'replied Long John.
After a while she locked the door again,got up and went back to the glass table.She put the key down and then she saw a little bottle on the table（'I'm sure it wasn't here before,'said Alice）.Round the neck of the bottle was a piece of paper with the words DRINK ME in large letters.
'Why can't you?'
'She is a she,I suppose,'Mrs Joe replied crossly.
'Unless you call Miss Havisham a he.And even you wouldn't do that.'
'What are we going to do with him?'
the Mole asked the Water Rat.
I went back to Geneva immediately.My family were very worried when they saw me.I was pale and my eyes were wild.I could not forget my promise to the monster, and the awful work that waited for me.
But I had to do it.It was the only way to keep my family safe… safe from his murdering hands around their necks.
'I'm going to London tomorrow, Miss Havisham,'I said,choosing my words carefully,'and I wanted to say goodbye.I've been so lucky since I saw you last,and I'm so grateful for it!'
'Hello,Kate,'he said.
'Yes,though not better than you.
'Clare observed them.
Once again, I reapplied my makeup and attempted to cover the bump with extra foundation.
Bjaaland began to understand.He started to smile and couldn't stop.He was warm and excited.
'I'm sorry,Mother,I can't for give her,'replied Jo,Next day, Jo wanted to get out of the house, so she picked up her skates and went next door to ask Laurie to tske her skating.
I was not pleased with this interview,and thought it was strange that the news of my expectations had not made me happier.
'Well,I accepted him,Ellen!
'she said crossly.
'But should I have done so?Should I?What do you think?'
He looked calm and cold,full of self-control.His face showed he had fought against passion and won,but did not like being the winner.He still found it difficult to accept that Tess,the pure village maiden,was not what she seemed.
How unexpected life could be!He put out the candle.The night came in,unconcerned and uninterested,the night which had swallowed up his happiness.
'Matthew Cuthbert, are you telling me that you want to keep her?
'asked Marilla crossly.
'What's happening?
'Rilla asked.
After a while he looked up.
'Thank God I'm not married to Bathsheba,'he thought.
'What would she have done,mar－ried to a husband as poor as I shall be!'
'What do you think of the intelligence of people?
'askedMavis Pellington.
I looked at him. 'There's a woman in this somewhere,isn't there?You've had a strange look in your eyes for weeks.'
'Yes.'
Fagin and Sikes looked at each other, shocked by her reaction.
Some people do sit and fish all day.They never catch any fish, of course.
You may catch a dead cat or two, but you will not catch any fish.
When you go for a walk by the river, the fish come and stand half out of the water, with their mouths open for bread.And if you go swimming, they all come and stare at you and get in your way.But you cannot catch them.
'As well as I ever wish to!
'I've spent four days in the same house as him,and I consider him very disagreeable.'
4 The Locked Room
'Any Highlander would do that.
The best place for the lad who shot Colin Campbell is the heather,and we must all do what we can to help him keep away from the soldiers.'
Dr Livesey did not like the song.He looked up angrily before he went on talking to old Taylor, the gardener.
Others in the room took no notice of the song. The captain beat the table with his hand for silence.
The voices in the room died away, all except Dr Livesey's.The doctor continued to speak.
Alice looked puzzled. 'What is an unbirthday present?'
'can't I help you yourself,Pip?'
'No money.In fact,sir,even this headstone has not been paid for.'
The Red Death had been in the country for many,many years.No disease had ever been so deadly.People called it the Red Death because it left blood,red horrible blood,on the body and face of each person it visited.And no one,if visited,was ever left alive.Once a person was touched by the Red Death,he immediately felt pains,and soon afterwards started to bleed from every part of his body.in thirty minutes he was dead.After that no one,not even his family,went near the blood-covered body.
'All the crew must be on board by four o'clock this after－ noon, Trelawney told Long John.
'Now what have we here?
'said old Joe,opening the women's bundles.
'Buttons,pencils,boots,silver spoons,some excellent bed-curtains,blankets and—a very good shirt,'he added,feeling the fine cotton.
'Where is the spaceship?
'Kiah asked.
'Mr Heathcliff will want to look at this,'he said,putting it in his pocket.But when Cathy pretended to cry,Hareton could not bear to make her sad,and he threw the letter down on the table.She eagerly read every word,and asked me several questions about the people at the Grange.
'Oh!
But Anne…we're reading a new book next week…and we're playing a new game on Monday, and… It'll be very exciting!
And you'll miss it, Anne! '
I swiveled around.
There behind another banyan tree was Hanks!
Sitting on the back of a running moto.
The driver was a skinny teen with a cutoff T-shirt and arms covered with tatoos.
He revved the engine and grinned at me.
Hanks guestured for me to jump on the back.
"Stuck?
How could you—"
'Now,Jim,'I cried,'you're a free man!
'We were all very happy,but Tom was the happiest of all,because he had a bullet in his leg.
'I haven't a single coin with me,my dear,'said Fagin.
"Perhaps we can.If not,we can make our way to England.Nothing venture,nothing gain."
1 Two Ships
'I am sure you're right,'said Mr Bennet.
'No doubt you are expert at flattering with delicacy.May I ask how you think of these pleasing compliments?'
I wrote to our Mother,——if she will allow me to call her so—— the letter is gone.
If I hadit back I would write it over again. I see that inletting the letter"write itself" it took entirely too unconventional a form.
I forgot,occasionally, thefact that I was really writing to the PUBLIC,instead of to her.
And so I elaborated what neededno elaboration,  merely touched upon matterswhich should have been treated more fully.
But don't you see?——if I had kept the public in mymind, the sense of being questioned   crossquestioned by outsiders, upon matters essentiallyprivate   personal, would have been so oppressivethat I could not have written at all.
It is hard toknow that what you are writing（confessing） aboutyour most delicate  private affairs is to be read bystrangers and unlovingly criticised   commentedon at tea tables   among miscellaneous groupswho would often rather say a smart thing than akind one.
So I think that maybe, after all, theremay have been a little natural impulse to holdback,instead of speaking out freely, though I wasnot really conscious of such an impulse.
I do notthink I am more sensitive than others woule be under like circumstances.
In a moment she was out of the room and running down the stairs.But it wasn't really running, because she was moving gently through the air and her feet weren't touching the stairs at all.At the bottom she managed to catch hold of the doorpost,and after that she was pleased to find herself walking again in a natural way.
'The water's clear,isn't it?
'he said.
'Look at that big fish lying on the bottom.
I've been trying to catch him all evening. '
Edward married Wallis Simpson six months later,on 3rd June1937.None of the Royal Family came to the wedding.Edward was forty-three.Wallis was forty-one.And they now took a new name-the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
"Nothing."
When the carriage containing the young couple arrived at Longbourn House,the two elder Bennet sisters were shocked to see how unashamed Lydia was.She entered the house,laughing and joking,and asked all her sisters to congratulate her.Wick- ham was no more embarrassed than she was,and spoke to ev- eryone in his usual flattering,agreeable manner.They seemed to have no idea of the anxiety they had caused by their shame- less and wicked behaviour.
As Mom and Dad went back to their journal and book respectively, I text-message Amber: They said NO.
Told U.
She agreed to this.
'Shall I hold the horse?
'she asked.
'No,you're not!
'said Mary crossly.
21 Mr Rivers'sacrifice
Opposite the two nuns sat a man and a woman.The man was Cornudet; he was wellknown for his dissolute habits and crazy political ideas.Hehad inherited a respectable fortune from his father, but had wasted it away upon drink and useless ambitions.Now he took it into his head that he would be better employed at Havre,where his help would be needed.
'Sallie says they are very friendly,and the old man thinks they are all wonderful.'
'I see,'said David Wilson.
'It's a hard world,the world of business.
'He looked at John's old grey suit.
'So now you want a job as a biologist.Well,this is a chemical company,Mr Duncan.We make paint.But we need a biologist to make sure that everything in this factory is safe.We want someone to tell the government that it's safe to work here,and that it's safe to have a paint factory near the town.That's impor-tant to us.'
I came here to look for you, and I'm lucky to have found you.
I'd like some information. '
He pushed a couple of coins across the table.
In the living-room it was dark and Mr White did not have a candle.
Slowly, he went across the room and he put out his hand for the monkey's paw.
He touched it, and quickly took his hand away again.
Kiah took Rilla's hand,'Yes,'he said.
'Let's get back to Kisangani.We can phone Adai again tomorrow.'
'If it still had that power, one word from you would doubtless send me to prison, ' said Darnay.
But he hadn't given any of these things to her,because she wouldn't talk to him.When he went to see her,she closed the door in his face;when he rang,she put the phone down;when he wrote,she sent the letters back unopened.
'It's hard for her to forgive you,Amy,'said Meg.
'Go after them and wait until Jo is enjoying herself,then give her a kiss or do something kind.'
"That's not funny!"
I could barely croak it out.
'Because I love you,Christine.Marry me,be my wife,and love me.Then Raoul and the Persian can live.'
Then a man in a grey coat and grey hat came up.His name was Grant,and he looked a happy,sensible kind of man.He had been longer on the cab stand than any of the other men,so they let him through to have a look at me,and waited for his opinion.
'Where have you been,and what's that behind you?
'asked Meg.
Bathsheba threw her arms round his neck,crying wildly from the depths of her heart,'Don't,don't kiss them!Oh Frank,no!I love you better than she did!Kiss me too,Frank!You will kiss me too,Frank!'
He came along the passage and stopped outside my door.Then he walked past and went on down the stairs.
'He's a very good man.I couldn't help liking him.'
Tess and Angel arrived at the old d'Urberville farmhouse.It was empty,although a woman came to cook and clean for them.They had their tea together,and Clare delighted in eating from the same plate as Tess.Looking at her he thought,'Do I realize how important I am to this woman? And how I must look after her?I must never forget to think about her feelings!'
Mr Hyde hesitated for a moment, then he stood under thestreet light and the lawyer saw his face.
'Thank you,' saidMr Utterson.
'Now I shall know you again.
'Yes,'said Mr Hyde,'it may indeed be useful.Here,too,is my address.You may need it one day.
'He gave the lawyerhis address,which was in a poor part of London.
'Good God!
'thought the lawyer,'does Hyde know aboutJekyll's will?Is that what he's thinking of?
'But he saidnothing.
'And now,'said Mr Hyde,'How did you know me?'
'You were described to me.'
'Who did that?'
'I know people who know you.'
'Who?'
asked Mr Hyde sharply.
'Doctor Jekyll,for example,'said the lawyer.
'He never told you!
'cried Mr Hyde in sudden anger. 'Don't lie to me!
'And before the lawyer could answer, heturned the key in the lock and disappeared into the house.
Mr Utterson stared at the closed door. 'Why do I dislikehim so much? 'he said to himself.
'Enfield was right—thereis something evil about the man.Poor Henry Jekyll,I'm worried about you.
Your new friend will mean trouble for you.'
Round the corner from the narrow street there was a squareof handsome old houses.One of these was Doctor.Jekyll's house,and Mr Utterson knocked at the front door.
The servant answered and told him that Doctor Jekyll was not athome.
'I saw Mr Hyde go in by the laboratory door in the street atthe back of the house, said the lawyer.
'That's right,Mr Utterson,'replied the servant. 'MrHyde has his own key, and comes and goes when he likes. Wehave orders from Doctor Jekyll to obey him.'
Mr Utterson walked home more worried than ever.
A fortnight later Doctor Jekyll gave a dinner party for a fewold friends.Mr Utterson was among them and he remained after the others had left.
'I've been wanting to speak to you for some time,Jekyll,'said the lawyer,'about your will.'
Doctor Jekyll was a tall, well－made man of fifty with asmooth, kindly face.
'My poor friend,'he said,'you doworry unnecessarily, you know. Like poor Lanyon when Itold him about my new ideas. "Imaginative rubbish"he calledthem… I'm very disappointed in Lanyon.'
But the lawyer did not want to talk about Doctor Lanyon. 'You know I've never agreed with your will,'he continued.
'Well,I've learnt something about your friend Hyde,'continued the lawyer.
The colour of the doctor's handsome face changed from pinkto greyish-white. 'I don't want to hear any more,'he said.
'You don't understand. I'm in a very difficult,painful situation.
'Tell me everything,'said Mr Utterson,'and I'll do mybest to help you.'
'You're very kind,but this is a private matter.I'll tell youone thing—I can get rid of Mr Hyde any time I want.
Youmust understand,however, that I take a great interest in poorHyde.I know you've seen him—he told me, and I'm afraidhe wasn't very polite to you.
But I really do care about him.And if anything happens to me,I want you to promise tomake sure that he inherits my money.'
'I onlyask you to help him,when I'm gone.'
'I promise,'said Mr Utterson sadly.
3 The Carew murder
One night in London,nearly a year later, a servant girlwas sitting at her bedroom window, looking out at themoonlit street.
She saw a tall, handsome old man with whitehair coming along the street,and a shorter,younger manwalkingtowardshim.The old man spoke politely to theyounger one.
He seemed, the girl said later, to be asking hisway. Then the girl looked more closely at the younger manand recognized him.
'It was Mr Hyde, 'she said later. 'He once visited my master.'
Mr Hyde, the girl said, was carrying a heavy stick. He wasplaying with it impatiently as he listened to the old man.
Thensuddenly he seemed to explode with anger.
'He was like a madman,'the servant girl said.'
He shookhis stick at the old man,who stepped back in surprise.
Thenhe hit the old man violently with the stick and knocked him tothe ground. He beat the helpless body again and again.
It was two o'clock in the morning before she was consciousagain, and able to call the police.
The murderer had disappeared,but the dead man was still lying on the ground withthe murder weapon beside him.The stick had broken in themiddle, and one half still lay beside the murdered man.
Thepolice decided that the murderer had carried away the otherhalf.A gold watch and a purse were found in the dead man'spockets, but no cards or papers— except a letter addressed toMr Utterson.
A policeman brought this letter to the lawyer the nextmorning.Together they drove to the police station where thebody had been taken.
A police inspector showed him the body.
'Yes,I recognize him,'said Mr Utterson heavily. 'He isSir Danvers Carew.'
'Thank you, sir,'said the inspector. 'And do you recognizethis?'
He showed Mr Utterson the broken stick and told himthe servant girl's story.
Mr Utterson knew the stick at once. 'That's HenryJekyll's stick! 'he said to himself.
'I gave it to him long ago.'
'Is this Hyde a short, evil－looking man? 'he asked.
'That's how the servant girl described him, sir,'agreed theinspector.
'Come with me,'said Mr Utterson to the inspector. 'Ithink I know where he lives.'
Mr Utterson led him to the address on Mr Hyde' s visitingcard.It was in a poor part of London,in a dirty street full ofcheap bars and eating－houses. This was the home of HenryJekyll's favourite friend—the man who would inherit Jekyll'squarter of a million pounds.
An old servant opened the door.Under her silvery hair wasa smooth face with a false smile and evil eyes, but she was polite enough.
'Yes,'she said,'Mr Hyde lives here.But he's not athome.
My master came in very late last night.He left againafter only an hour.'
'Was that unusual?
'asked the inspector.
'Not at all,'replied the servant. 'He's often away,andfrequently stays away for months at a time.'
'We would like to see his flat,'said Mr Utterson.
'Oh,I can't do that,sir—'began the servant.

Physical Facilities (Quality Construction, Maintenance, and Design of all Facilities)
Support Organizations (Internal Support and Partnerships)
(continued next page)
Understanding, engaging, and committing to the advancement of standards and related policies in all areas of AZA assessment constitutes "modern zoological practices and philosophies".
These practices and philosophies define excellence in our profession, and are what distinguish AZA accredited institutions from all other institutions that have animals for guests to see and appreciate.
Because of the many variations among institutions, the majority of AZA standards are carefully designed to be performance standards (i.e., assessing the level of achievement considered acceptable to fulfill a performance characteristic, and choice in method for meeting the goal).
This differs from engineering standards, where exact and precisely prescribed steps are required to fulfill an engineering characteristic, with little or no variation in method for meeting the goal.
AZA institutions may achieve performance standards in a variety of ways, but all standards must be met.
AZA  Accreditation  - PRODUCT
AZA accredited institutions are differentiated as exemplary facilities through the vigorous and voluntary commitment to shared high standards, achieving measurable goals, and continually pursuing outcomes that benefit animals, guests and communities.
Distinguishing characteristics of an AZA-accredited institution include:
Extraordinary focus on animal care, welfare, and well-being
Modern facilities and practices for comprehensive veterinary care
Scientific advancement in animal care and conservation
Focus and participation to support sustainable animal populations
Exhibit aesthetics and habitat studies, planning, and design
Innovative and inspirational educational programs and experiences
Excellence in guest engagement and effective guest services
Economic development and community partnerships
Professional staff development and training
Comprehensive preparedness in public and animal safety
Sound business planning and financial management
Dynamic and mission-driven strategic and master planning
"Raising the bar" and regularly advancing operational standards
AZA zoo and aquarium standards support the premise of five opportunities.
These tenets propose that animals: (1) receive nutritionally complete diets that bring out the natural feeding response and behavior; (2) are afforded comfortable living experiences with choice and control to promote mentally and physically healthy behaviors; (3) experience good physical health; (4) are provided quality spaces to live in with appropriate social groupings that promote natural, species-appropriate and motivated behavior; and (5) develop natural coping skills and avoid chronic stress.
IMPORTANT NOTE: All AZA accredited institutions and certified related facilities must follow all local, state, and federal laws and/or regulations.
Some AZA standards may be more stringent than existing laws and/or regulations. In such cases, the AZA standard(s) must be met.
ANIMAL CARE, WELFARE, & MANAGEMENT
General Considerations:
Animal care, welfare and sustainable population management are among the  most critical and complex tasks performed by AZA zoos and aquariums.
Administration and management must be guided by modern professional  principles establishing plans and procedures to execute those functions.
Providing excellent animal care and public education about wildlife results in  direct and indirect contact between animals and humans, whether staff,  volunteers, or visitors.
They include  maximizing quality in healthcare, behavior management, and sanitation, along  with the educational value of connecting an increasingly urban public to animals  and nature.
In doing this there are significant risks to consider as well, such as  injury to animals and people, psychological stress, and potential transmission of  infectious disease.
It is important for all zoos and aquariums to strategically  assess the benefits and risks of animal contact throughout their institutions, and  to implement the best, most productive and safe human-animal interactions  possible.
(See standard 11, and pages 66 - 82 of these standards for further  information.)
Local, State and Federal Laws
The institution must comply with all relevant local, state/provincial, and federal wildlife laws and/or regulations.
It is understood that, in some cases, AZA accreditation standards are more stringent than existing laws and/or regulations.
In these cases the AZA standard must be met.
Animal Care Manuals
As available, the institution must review and provide access for all paid and unpaid animal care staff, to all AZA Animal Care Manuals (ACMs) that have been approved and that apply to species at the institution.
Explanation:  A listing of approved ACMs is available on AZA's website at: http://www.aza.org/animal-care-manuals/. Institutions should check regularly for updates.
Guidelines outlined in the Animal Care Manuals (ACMs) should be followed.
Explanation:  Institutions should review the guidelines and suggestions within the ACMs as needed, and tailor their animal care programs, protocols, and exhibits accordingly.
Documents and Policies
The institution must have an Institutional Collection Plan (ICP).
The ICP must be reevaluated and updated at minimum every five years.
Explanation:  The purpose of an ICP is to thoughtfully assess, on a regular basis, the reason for having each taxon in the collection.
The ICP must include a statement of justification for all species and number of individuals or groups in the institution's planned collection.
The ICP must consider some, but not necessarily all, of the following criteria, in addition to others that may be relevant:  special welfare considerations, status in the wild, status in zoos and aquariums, recommendations stated in AZA TAGs' Regional Collection Plans, existence and priorities of cooperative management programs, ability to maintain the species in a physically, psychologically, and socially healthy environment, exhibit value, exhibit suitability (may include climatic considerations), need for husbandry and other behavioral research, and any other issues specific to the institution's mission and vision.
The institution must have a written policy on responsible population management that incorporates all requirements contained in AZA's Policy On Responsible Population Management [AZA's "RPM Policy"].
(See pages 86 – 93 of these standards for further information).
Explanation:  Policies on animal acquisition, transfer, euthanasia and reintroduction (including breeding loans) should be continually reviewed to keep them current with all applicable laws and/or regulations.
Such policies must also incorporate all policies and/or resolutions adopted by AZA regarding hunting ranches, animal auctions, research, pets, participation in SSPs, and TAGs, and other issues involving the acquisition, transfer, euthanasia or reintroduction of wildlife.
Records must be maintained for all transactions involving acquisition, transfer, euthanasia or reintroduction of animals to and from the institution and must include the terms of the transaction.
In making the decision to transfer an animal(s) to a non-AZA accredited facility the AZA institution must document that the receiving institution is willing and able to provide proper care and welfare for the animal(s) and that the transfer is done in accordance with AZA's RPM Policy.
Copies of all relevant permits, importation papers, declaration forms, titles, and other appropriate documents establishing a paper trail of legal acquisition must be maintained (as detailed in AZA's RPM Policy).
When such information does not exist (the institution's maintenance of confiscated wildlife) an explanation must be provided regarding such animals.
Records
0. The institution must show evidence of having a zoological records management system for managing animal records, veterinary records, and other relevant information.
An animal inventory must be compiled at least once a year and include data regarding acquisition, transfer, euthanasia, release, and reintroduction.
All species owned by the institution must be listed on the inventory, including those animals on loan to and from the institution.
Animals must be identifiable, whenever practical, and have corresponding ID numbers.
For animals maintained in colonies/groups or other animals not considered readily identifiable, the institution must provide a statement explaining how record keeping is maintained.
Animal records and veterinary records, whether in electronic or paper form, must be duplicated and stored in a separate location.
Animal records are defined as data, regardless of physical form or medium, providing information about individual animals, or samples or parts thereof, or groups of animals.
Explanation:  The institution must prevent animal and veterinary records from being lost or destroyed in a catastrophe.
A complete and up-to-date set of these records must be duplicated and stored in separate locations (e.g., not in the same building, if kept on site).
Consideration should be given to physical distance and natural hazards when selecting the separate location.
At least one set of the institution's historical animal and veterinary records must be stored and protected.
Those records should include permits, titles, declaration forms, and other pertinent information.
A paid or unpaid staff member must be designated as being responsible for the institution's animal record-keeping system.
That person must be charged with establishing and maintaining the institution's animal records, as well as with keeping all paid and unpaid animal care staff members, apprised of relevant laws and regulations regarding the institution's animals.
Animal and veterinary records must be kept current.
Explanation:  For keepers and other paid line staff, event, identification, and husbandry information should be recorded in keeper reports or other written forms on the same day whenever possible, but no later than the day following.
Registrars should enter acquisition, transfer, euthanasia, and reintroduction data into the institutional records database within two weeks.
Records must be kept for at least five years (or until the next accreditation cycle is completed).
Prior to disposal of any animal record files (e.g., keeper reports), all pertinent information must be transferred to the animal's permanent historical file.
8. The institution must have a record-keeping system that provides sufficient detail to enhance husbandry, welfare, breeding, conservation, and medical health advancements to move forward the critical knowledge of the species through permanent and retrievable documentation.
9. At least one member of an institution's paid staff responsible for animal record-keeping should have the proper training.
Explanation: AZA's Institutional Records-Keeping course is one option to obtain appropriate training.
Animal Care, Welfare, and Well-Being
All animals must be well cared for and presented in a manner reflecting modern zoological practices in exhibit design, balancing animals' welfare requirements with aesthetic and educational considerations.
All animals must be housed in enclosures which are safe for the animals and meet their physical and psychological needs.
All animals must be kept in appropriate groupings which meet their social and welfare needs.
All animals should be provided the opportunity to choose among a variety of conditions within their environment.
If animal demonstrations are part of the institution's programs, an educational/conservation message must be an integral component.
If ambassador animals are used, a written policy on the use of live animals in programs must be on file and incorporate the elements contained in AZA's "Recommendations For Developing an Institutional Ambassador Animal Policy" (see pages 75 - 80).
An education, conservation, and welfare message must be an integral component of all programs.
Animals in education programs must be maintained and cared for by paid and/or unpaid trained staff, and housing conditions must meet standards required for the remainder of the animals in the institution.
While outside their primary enclosure, although the conditions may be different, animal safety and welfare need to be assured at all times.
For animals used in offsite programs and for educational purposes, the institution must have adequate protocols in place to protect the rest of the animals at the institution from exposure to infectious agents.
Explanation:  A veterinary risk assessment should be made when developing and implementing institution protocols to protect animal health in situations where education or institution animals are taken off site.
Institutions that include elephants in their collection must follow the AZA Standards For Elephant Management And Care.
