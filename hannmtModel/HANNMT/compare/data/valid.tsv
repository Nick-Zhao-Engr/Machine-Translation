No other evidence.	再没有别的证据可以证明了。
Suddenly, this appeared.	突然之间，这件文物出现了。
And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution, by geology, here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true.	对于那些相信圣经却被进化论和地质学动摇了对创世纪的信仰的人们来说，这是一项振奋人心的证据，它证明了圣经在历史上的真实性。
It's a great 19th century moment.	这是19世纪的一个伟大时刻。
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true, hurrah for archeology, but the interpretation was rather more complicated.	但是，这也让事情变得更加复杂 这些事实都是真的 对于考古学来说是个好消息 但对它的解读却越加复杂。
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect.	因为圆柱上的描述与希伯来圣经上的描述 有一个关键的差异。
The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.	圆柱上的巴比伦语 是由信奉巴比伦的主神马杜克的 祭祀写就的。
And, not surprisingly, they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.	所以他们告诉你这一切都是马杜克的功劳 这一点也不奇怪。
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."	马杜克，我们所信奉的神，召唤了赛鲁士。
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand, calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon.	马杜克拉着赛鲁士的手 告诉他要管理好人民 并赋予他治理巴比伦的权力。
Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great, generous things of setting the people free.	马杜克告诉赛鲁士 他要做这些伟大而慷慨的事 来让人民自由。
And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk.	这就是为什么我们都应对马杜克 心怀感激和崇敬。
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this.	而希伯来圣经的作者 则在旧约中 表达了完全不同的看法 这也不奇怪。
For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen.	当然，对他们来说 不可能是马杜克。
It can only be Jehovah.	只能是耶和华造就了这一切。
And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people.	所以在以赛亚书中 我们能找到相应的文本 这一切的功劳 不属于马杜克 而属于以色列的主神耶和华 耶和华 也召唤了赛鲁士 也拉着赛鲁士的手 让他管理好人民。
It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event, two different religious takeovers of a political fact.	同一件事拥有两种不同宗教的描述 同一个政治事件 有两种不同宗教的解读 这是个绝佳的例子。
God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions.	我们知道 神往往站在军事力量强大的那一方。
The question is, which god was it?	但问题是，是哪一个神呢？
And the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion.	这场辩论 让19世纪时的每个人都觉得不安 它让人们认识到希伯来圣经 只是一个更广阔的宗教世界的一部分。
And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah, and yet, Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk.	很明显 赛鲁士圆柱比以赛亚书要更为古老 然而，耶和华所说的话 与马杜克所说的 非常相似。
And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this, because he says, this is God speaking, of course, "I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me."	可能以赛亚对这个事件有些略微的了解 因为他说 当然， 是神说 我召唤你 虽然你并不知道我。
I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.	我认为这是承认 赛鲁士并未意识到 他所听从的是耶和华的命令。
And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.	他对于听从马杜克的命令也同样感到吃惊。
Because interestingly, of course, Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts.	因为，有趣的是 赛鲁士是一个不错的伊朗人 他另有一整套不同的神的体系 而这些神从未在任何文本中被提到过。
That's 1879.	那场辩论是1879年的事。
40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world.	40年之后 到了1917年 赛鲁士圆柱进入了一个不同的世界。
This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return.	这是一个属于当代世界 属于实际政治的年代 这一年发表了贝尔福宣言 这一年在中东崛起的新帝国 英帝国决定建立 一个犹太人的民族家园 它将准许 犹太人的回归。
And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.	身处东欧的犹太人 对于这件事的反应是狂热的。
And across Eastern Europe, Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.	犹太人在整个东欧 将赛鲁士 和乔治五世的图画 并排展示 这两位伟大的统治者 准许犹太人回归耶路撒冷。
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan.	赛鲁士圆柱也进入了公众的视野 其上的文本是神的旨意的一部分 它展示出 为什么战后发生的事 会在1918年结束。
You all know what happened.	你们都知道发生了什么。
The state of Israel is setup, and 50 years later, in the late 60s, it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.	以色列建国了 50年后，在20世纪60年代末 很明显，英国的帝国主义也走到了尽头。
And another story of the cylinder begins.	另一个关于赛鲁士圆柱的故事开始了。
The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide, has to be kept safe from communism, and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran, the Shah.	英国和美国决定 民族家园地区不应受到共产主义的影响 而应起到保护作用的即将诞生的超级大国 将会是沙王所领导的伊朗。
And so the Shah invents an Iranian history, or a return to Iranian history, that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder.	因此沙王创造了伊朗的历史 或者说是伊朗回归的历史 这让他成为一项伟大传统的核心 并发行 印有他自己 和赛鲁士圆柱的硬币。
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis, he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran, and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty.	当他在波斯波利斯举办盛大的庆典时 他要求赛鲁士圆柱回到伊朗 大英博物馆遂借出圆柱，并送往德黑兰 这成为巴列维王朝 伟大庆典的一部分。
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.	赛鲁士圆柱就是沙王统治的保证。
10 years later, another story: Iranian Revolution, 1979.	10年后，另一个故事拉开了帷幕 即1979年的伊朗革命。
Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus; we're not interested in that history, we're interested in Islamic Iran -- until Iraq, the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region, attacks.	这是伊斯兰革命，与赛鲁士无关 我们对那段历史并不感兴趣 我们感兴趣的是具有伊斯兰特色的伊朗 直到伊拉克 那个我们都认为应属于该地区势力范围的新生力量 发动了攻击。
Then another Iran-Iraq war.	这又是一场两伊战争。
And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past, their great past when they fought Iraq and won.	伊朗人能否铭记他们那伟大的历史 就变得很关键 在那段历史中 他们战胜了伊拉克。
It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians -- Muslims and non-Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran, people who are devout, not devout.	至关重要的一点是找到一个象征 让所有伊朗人团结起来 让穆斯林，非穆斯林 基督徒，索罗亚斯德教教徒，居住在伊朗的犹太人 和那些无论虔诚与否的人都团结起来。
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.	显然，赛鲁士圆柱是最合适的象征。
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan.	所以当大英博物馆和德黑兰国家博物馆 展开合作时，就像我们一直以来所做的那样 伊朗人只要求 借一样东西。
It's the only object they want.	这是他们唯一想要的东西。
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.	他们想借赛鲁士圆柱。
And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time.	去年 赛鲁士圆柱被送往德黑兰 这已经是第二次了。
It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions, Mrs. Ardakani.	它由德黑兰国家博物馆馆长 亲手放进盒子里 这位馆长是一位伊朗妇女，地位非常崇高 她就是艾达卡尼女士。
It was a huge event.	这是一次隆重的事件。
This is the other side of that same picture.	故事的另外一面
It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months.	在德黑兰 仅在几个月之内，就有一两百万的人 参观了居鲁士圆柱。
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West.	这次展出的轰动效应 在西方前所未见。
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths.	这也是一场伟大辩论的主题 即赛鲁士圆柱意味着什么，赛鲁士又意味着什么 但首先，圆柱上所描写的赛鲁士 是家国的捍卫者 是为伊朗身份和伊朗人民 而奋斗的战士 他能够对所有的信仰都宽容相待
And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.	在当今伊朗 索罗亚斯德教教徒和基督徒 在伊朗议会中的地位得以保障，这是非常值得自豪的。
To see this object in Tehran, thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it.	为了在德黑兰一睹这件展品 居住在伊朗的数万犹太人 前往德黑兰。
It became a great emblem, a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad.	赛鲁士圆柱成为了一个伟大的象征 一场辩论的主题 关于伊朗在国内外的意义。
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?	伊朗仍然是被压迫人民的守护者么？
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?	伊朗仍会赋予那些 被暴君奴役和剥削的人们以自由么？
This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return.	这是令人振奋的全国性的讨论 它由一场 关于回归的隆重盛会 所激发
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran.	在这里，你能看到巨大的赛鲁士圆柱 与伊朗历史中的伟人一起在舞台上 明确他们在伊朗传统中 所占有的一席之地
It was a narrative presented by the president himself.	这是伊朗总统 亲口叙述的
And for me, to take this object to Iran, to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is, what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today.	对我来说 将赛鲁士圆柱送回伊朗 或者说被允许将它送回伊朗 就是被允许成为 一场最高层次的 伟大辩论的一部分 这场辩论是关于伊朗是什么 到底有多少个不同的伊朗 以及伊朗不同的历史 将会对今天的世界产生怎样的影响
It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration.	这场辩论仍在继续 它将继续产生轰动的效应 因为赛鲁士圆柱 是象征人类渴望的 伟大的声明之一
It stands with the American constitution.	它与美国的宪法具有同等地位
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta.	他当然比大宪章更能代表 真正的自由
It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region.	它是一份文件，对伊朗和整个地区 都具有深远的意义
A replica of this is at the United Nations.	它的一份复制品 在联合国
In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place.	今年秋天，在纽约 当关于中东未来的伟大辩论开始时 它将被展出
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures.	我想要问你们几个问题来结束我的演讲 赛鲁士圆柱将引发的下一个故事 又是什么呢？
It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories.	当然，赛鲁士圆柱 会出现在很多的中东故事里
And what story of the Middle East, what story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said, what is expressed in this cylinder?	那么你们希望看到 在中东 和世界上发生怎样的故事 来体现赛鲁士圆柱 所表达的意义呢？
The right of peoples to live together in the same state, worshiping differently, freely -- a Middle East, a world, in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate.	不同的民族有权利 在同一个国家生活 自由的供奉自己信仰的宗教 在中东这个世界里 宗教已不再是辩论 或引发分裂的主题了
In the world of the Middle East at the moment, the debates are, as you know, shrill.	目前的中东世界里 辩论仍然十分激烈
But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing, the Cyrus cylinder.	但我认为很有可能 这些声音中最有力最明智的那一个 将会是来自 这件沉默的物品 来自赛鲁士圆柱
Thank you.	谢谢
How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?	这里有多少人看过希区柯克的电影《鸟》？
Any of you get really freaked out by that?	是不是认为那片子太过离奇了？
You might want to leave now.	要是那样的话，你现在可以走了。
So, this is a vending machine for crows.	大家看到的是一台专门为乌鸦设计的自动售货机。
And over the past few days, many of you have been asking me, "How did you come to this?	过去几天，人们都在问我同样的问题： 你怎么开始搞这玩意的？
How did you get started doing this?"	有什么吸引你的地方吗？
And it started, as with many great ideas, or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway, at a cocktail party.	说实话，这玩意就像很多伟大的想法， 或者一些你无法在脑中驱散的想法一样， 是从一次鸡尾酒派对产生的。
About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine, and we're sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess.	大概十年前，我与一个朋友在一个鸡尾酒派对上， 我们坐在那，他一直在抱怨乌鸦 乌鸦们把他的院子搞得一团糟。
And he was telling me that really, we ought to try and eradicate these things.	他那时很认真的跟我说，我们得想办法消灭这些鬼东西，
We gotta kill them because they're making a mess.	否则我们就不会有好日子过。
I said that was stupid, you know, maybe we should just train them to do something useful.	我跟他说，那才是坏主意呢， 咱们为何不训练它们，让乌鸦帮我们人类做一点有意义的事情？
And he said that was impossible.	他丢给我一句那不可能。
And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it's impossible.	我相信绝对不只我一人觉得这极度恼人 ——当有人告诉你那不可能时。
So, I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.	于是决定用10年的时间在我的业余时间专门研究乌鸦。
And after 10 years of this, my wife eventually said, "Look, you know, you gotta do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine."	现在10年过去了，我妻子说， 好吧，你也该把它做出来了， 你不是一直说要给乌鸦们做一个自动售货机么？
So I did.	于是我就把它做出来了。
But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving.	但我对这个项目感兴趣还有部分原因是因为 我开始注意到我们人类已经意识到 有很多物种因为人类无止尽的扩张 将会在地球上灭绝。 但貌似没人对那些 还生存在世上的物种有所关心——它们都还真正地活着。
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species, which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies, species like rats and cockroaches and crows.	这里我指的是那些长期与人共处， 并适应了人类生态系统的动物。
They'd become extremely adept at living with us.	并且随着继续与人生活在一起，它们的适应性还加变得更强。
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.	但反观人类呢，我们只是一直在不断屠杀它们而已。
And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.	为了做到这点，人类用喂养的方式来让它们寄生于我们
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.	我们给了动物们适应新环境的各种理由。
So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.	比如：老鼠的生育能力变得超强。
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows, have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.	而蟑螂，逮过蟑螂的人都知道， 它们已经不在乎我们的诱饵了。
So, I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial.	于是我想，为何不制造出一些能让我们人类和这些寄生虫共同受益的东西呢？
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.	以此和这些动物建立一种新型的关系，一种互利的关系。 从而让人类找到一条与其共处的新路子。
And so I built the vending machine.	这就是我制作动物专用自动售货机的理由。
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows.	不过如果你多了解一下乌鸦， 这个自动售货机的故事会更有趣。
It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings -- they're actually really thriving.	乌鸦们不仅仅是在人类环境中生存得不错—— 事实上，他们活得还很精彩。
They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America.	你在地球上任何一处角落——除了两极和南美至南端—— 都可以见得到乌鸦。
And in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings.	通常它们的栖息地离人类居所 不出5公里。
So we may not think about them, but they're always around.	虽然你也许不会想到这一点， 可是它们确确实实一直都这么活在我们身边。
And not surprisingly, given the human population growth, more than half of the human population is living in cities now.	这也不奇怪，我们的地球上人口暴涨， 其中有半数以上居住在城市。
And out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities.	除此之外，90%的人口增长 就都发生在城市里——
We're seeing a population boom with crows.	乌鸦这个种群也在经历同样的发展。
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.	所以鸟类的数量在我们看来 将会有一个爆炸型的增长，
So that's no great surprise.	这并没有什么奇怪的。
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.	但令我感到吃惊的是这些鸟儿竟然学会了 通过一些奇特的方式在我们的社会里求得生存。
And I'll give you an example of that.	大家看看下面的例子：
So this is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow.	它的名字是Betty，它是一只New Caledonia的乌鸦。
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.	在森林里，它们会用树枝从林木里 挑出虫子和其他食物。
Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.	此时它正尝试用铁线取出瓶子里的那块肉。
But the researchers had a problem.	但是研究者们遇到了一个问题。
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.	他们把试验搞砸了，因为只留下了一根线在那里。
And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.	而Betty以前可没尝试过这样的挑战。
You see, it wasn't working very well.	你可以看到，它进行得并不顺利。
So she adapted.	于是它想出了一个新法子。
Now this is completely unprompted. She had never seen this done before.	要知道，它没有看到过别的乌鸦这么做。
No one taught her to bend this into a hook, had shown her how it could happen.	之前也没有任何人或者别的乌鸦教它如何把线弯成钩子； 或者告诉过它可以通过这种方式捞肉。
But she did it all on her own.	这完全是它自己想出来的办法。
So keep in mind that she's never seen this done.	请一定记得它以前从没有学过的哦。
Right.	就这样。
Yeah. All right.	对，就这样。
That's the part where the researchers freak out.	这才是研究人员觉得不可思议的地方。
So, it turns out we've been finding more and more that crows are really, really intelligent.	我们发现越来越多的证据表明 乌鸦的确是聪明的，
Their brains are proportionate, in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.	它们的大脑占躯体的比例 和大猩猩相当。
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have.	大家也可能听过各种各样的关于乌鸦的趣闻吧。
For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice.	比如，在瑞典， 那里的乌鸦会趁渔人往冰隙里放钓钩的时候守在一边，
And when the fishermen move off, the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.	当渔人走了， 它们就飞过去拉起钓钩，吃掉钩上的鱼或钓饵。
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.	这可是搞得那里的渔人很烦恼。
On an entirely different tack, at University of Washington, they, a few years ago, were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.	而在华盛顿大学， 那里的研究员几年前 做了一个截然不同的实验。
Some students went out and netted some crows, brought them in, and were -- weighed them, and measured them and whatnot, and then let them back out again.	他们在校园里捉来一些乌鸦， 在实验室里加以标记、称量， 然后把它们放走。
And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week, these crows, whenever these particular students walked around campus, these crows would caw at them, and run around and make their life kind of miserable.	而随后的那个星期， 他们惊喜地发现，那些被放走的乌鸦 在校园里一见到那些捉过它们的学生， 就会冲着他们鸣叫， 并在他们周围飞来飞去，给他们的生活增添一些小烦恼。
They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week.	但之后几个星期还是如此，他们就不再那么惊喜了。
And the next month. And after summer break.	甚至到了下个月，到了夏季学期结束，
Until they finally graduated and left campus, and -- glad to get away, I'm sure -- came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.	到了他们毕业离校了—— 我相信他们是很高兴地离去的—— 可当他们偶尔回校来看看时，那些乌鸦还是记得他们。
So -- the moral being, don't piss off crows.	所以——大家看到了吧，千万别惹乌鸦。
So now, students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask.	正是这样的缘故， 现在华盛顿大学做乌鸦研究的学生 都带上巨大的假发，还套上面具。
It's fairly interesting.	这真是令人哑然的一件事。
So we know that these crows are really smart, but the more I dug into this, the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.	以上说的无非是要证明乌鸦是非常聪明的， 但我研究得越是深入， 越是觉得它们的智慧要比我们想象的高出一个层次。
Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments.	在新的城市环境中， 乌鸦们的谋生技能正在变得越来越娴熟。
In this Japanese city, they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can't manage: drop it among the traffic.	这是一座日本城市， 这里的乌鸦发明了一种吃果仁的办法—— 把坚果丢到车道上。
The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.	然后飞走， 等待汽车开过。
Joshua Klein: Yeah, yeah. Pretty interesting.	Joshua Klein: 看看，这是不是挺有趣的？
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts.	不过，有趣的倒不是借助过往车辆压开果核的做法，
In fact, that's old hat for crows.	事实上，乌鸦老早就学会了这门手艺了。
This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo.	刚才大家看到的景象 发生在10年前东京市郊的 一家驾驶学校附近。
And since that time, all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.	从那时开始， 附近的乌鸦也学会了这样的吃坚果的方式。
And now, every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk, waiting to collect its lunch.	如今，方圆五公里内的乌鸦都在人行道旁守候着， 等待过往车辆为他们带来午餐。
So, they're learning from each other. And research bears this out.	乌鸦通过互相学习，都掌握了这种技巧。
Parents seem to be teaching their young.	乌鸦父母还教会自己的孩子这样的技巧呢。
They've learned from their peers. They've learned from their enemies.	它们向同伴学习，也向它们的敌人学习。
If I have a little extra time, I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely.	如果我还有更多演讲时间，我会告诉你们一个有关乌鸦背信的案例 来更好地证明我的观点。
The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation.	最关键的是它们学会了适应不同的生态文化。
And as we heard yesterday, that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble, and we're starting to see it with them.	就如昨天我们听到的那样， 是潘多拉之盒将人类引入混乱， 现在是开始着手解决它的时候了。
They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment, which is really useful if you live in a city.	他们能快速且融洽地适应 新的挑战及环境中的新资源， 对于城市生活来说，这可真有用。
So we know that there's lots of crows.	好了，现在我们都知道城市里有大量的乌鸦，
We found out they're really smart, and we found out that they can teach each other.	它们很聪明，还懂得相互间分享生存的秘诀。
And when all this became clear to me, I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.	当我知道这一切以后， 我决定要专门为它们做一台自动售货机。
So that's what we did.	并且还做成功了。
This is a vending machine for crows.	这就是乌鸦专用自动售货机：
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.	我们用斯金纳理论，分四阶段训练法来训练乌鸦。
It's pretty simple.	其实也很简单。
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field, or someplace where there's lots of crows, and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.	首先，我们把这样的机器放到田野 或者乌鸦经常出没的地方。 在机器的底部放上一大堆的硬币和花生。
And crows eventually come by, and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there.	乌鸦来了，吃掉机器上的花生， 并且也习惯了机器的存在。
And eventually, they eat up all the peanuts.	吃光了地面的花生以后，
And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray, and they hop up and help themselves.	它们发现在售货机的出货口那里也有很多花生， 于是就跳到上面，也同样尽享美味。
And then they leave, and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is really dandy, if you're a crow.	每一天，那机器上都会放满了硬币和花生。 嘿，要是当那样的一只乌鸦也不错哟，
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.	每天都不愁吃的。
So, when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.	当它们都习惯这样的生活或，我们继续下一步
Now, they're used to the sound of the machine, and they keep coming back, and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there.	我们等到乌鸦都习惯于机器的声音，就把花生盖在硬币底下， 它们飞过来，掀开硬币，
And when they get really happy about this, we go ahead and stymie them.	就能吃得到花生，它们也挺开心的。 这时，我们决定给它们制造一些困难。
And we move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.	我们开始了第三阶段的训练。只把一枚硬币留在机器上，
Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing, this really pisses them off.	此时乌鸦飞过来，看到没有食物， 自然觉得很泄气——我们人也一样嘛。
So, they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something -- they sweep things out of the way with their beak.	所以它们出于寻找食物的本能—— 用它的喙在机器上扫来扫去，
And they do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot, and when that happens, they get a peanut.	不经意的把硬币碰到硬币口里去了， 于是它获得了一颗花生。
And so this goes on for some time.	于是它们也学会了，
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put the coin in the slot, and then they get their peanut.	每次都来这里， 只要把机器上的硬币丢到硬币口，就能吃得到花生，
And when they're really good and comfortable with that, we move to the final stage, in which they show up and nothing happens.	当他们对此过程非常熟练及满足以后， 我们进入训练的最后一个阶段，它们来到机器旁边，却发现什么也没有。
And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.	注意，就是这个关键的地方可以看出乌鸦是多么聪明。
Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.	要是一只松鼠，它来到机器旁，寻找花生，找不到，就走了
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.	隔天再来，又是没有，又跑回去。
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored, and then they go off and play in traffic.	如此反复五六次， 它们也就觉得没意思了。
Crows, on the other hand, show up, and they try and figure it out.	而乌鸦则不一样，它们要寻找出一个究竟。
They know that this machine's been messing with them, through three different stages of behavior.	通过前面三个阶段， 并且这样的玩笑越开越大。
They figure it's gotta have more to it.	它们觉得肯定还有更多方式获得花生。
So, they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot.	它们又是用头撞，又是用嘴咬。
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that, "Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage, lying around on the ground," hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot.	偶尔间有一些乌鸦想到了一个绝妙的主意： 嘿，大家还记得地面上放的那一大堆硬币么。
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts, until his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.	这样的技巧先是为第一批到来的乌鸦所垄断， 可慢慢的别的乌鸦也学会了……故事到此为止。
So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.	从这个故事我们得出结论： 我们可以训练乌鸦，让它们通过售货机吃上花生。
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year, but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.	你知不知道，每一年都有价值2.16亿的硬币丢在大街上。
I think that crows can be trained to do other things.	我觉得我们可以训练乌鸦来做其他事。
For example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?	比如，为何不可以通过训练，让乌鸦给体育馆捡垃圾？
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics?	或者让它们帮助我们从大堆的废弃电子元件里头挑出有用的部件？
Or maybe do search and rescue?	又或者让它们参与搜救工作？
The main thing, the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.	我这个演讲的主要的一个观点是 我们可以寻找到一种与此类动物共存的途径，
We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them, but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.	我们能找到与其他族群共处的方式 而不仅仅是灭绝它们， 我们可以和它们实现共赢。
Thanks very much.	非常感谢大家。
What we're really here to talk about is the "how."	我们在此真正讨论的是怎么做
Okay, so how exactly do we create this world-shattering, if you will, innovation?	好的，那么我们究竟是怎么创造这 世界震惊的创新，如果你愿意
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.	现在，我想跟大家分享一个小故事
We'll go back a little more than a year.	让我们把时间倒回一年多以前
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?	事实上，关于那个日子，我很好奇地想知道 你们当中是否有人知道在哪个重大的日子发生了什么
It was February 3rd, 2008.	那是2008年2月3号
Anyone remember what happened, February 3rd, 2008?	有人知道那天发生了什么， 2008年2月3号
Super Bowl.	超级碗。
I heard it over here.	我从那听见了。
It was the date of the Super Bowl.	那正是超级碗的日子
And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties, is that it seemed to us that across the United States, if you will, tribal councils had convened.	正是这个原因这个日子才如此重大 我的同事，约翰.金 和 海利，华特和我注意到 当我们开始调查一些超级碗团体时 我们发现似乎 贯穿全美 如果你愿意，部落委员会已经召集了
And they had discussed things of great national importance.	并且他们讨论了一些有国家重要性的事
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"	比如，我们喜欢百威的广告吗
and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"	我们喜欢墨西哥玉米片吗以及哪一方会赢
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.	但是他们也讨论他们将会支持哪一个候选人
And if you go back in time to February 3rd, it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.	如果把时间倒回2月3号 当时希拉里看似将要得到民主党的提名
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.	甚至一些民调表示她将会一路走下去
But when we talked to people, it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States.	但是当我们与民众交谈时 我们发现貌似一个漏斗效应已经发生 在这些遍布在美国大地上的部落之中
Now what is a tribe?	那么部落是什么呢？
A tribe is a group of about 20 -- so kind of more than a team -- 20 to about 150 people.	 部落是一个小组 包括20人，看上去更像一个团队 20到大约150人
And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.	我们的研究成果正是基于这些部落
But not just work.	不仅仅是研究工作。
It's within these tribes that societies get built, that important things happen.	由于这些部落 社会得以建立 重要的事情得以发生
And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives from various tribal councils that met, also known as Super Bowl parties, we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.	所以如果你愿意，当我们调查一些代表 他们来自各种部落委员会，他们相见 他们也知道超级碗团体 第二天我们发送了如下的电子邮件给40位报纸编辑
February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.	2月4号，我们将结果发布在我们的网站上，这一切都早于超级星期二
We said, "The tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama."	我们说：我们所在的部落表明 胜出者将会是奥巴马
Now, the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.	我们知道这个结果的原因是 我们花费了过去的十年 研究部落，研究自然地形成的团体
All of you are members of tribes.	你们所有人都是部落的一员
In walking around at the break, many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.	当你在休息散步时 你们中的许多人会遇见你们部落的成员，然后你们相互交谈
And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do, which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe, and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe, and make introductions.	并且，如果你们愿意，你们当中许多人做着一些伟大的部落领导者所作的事 那就是找到 你部落的一个人 然后找到一个属于另一个的部落的人 最后相互介绍他们
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.	事实上这就是伟大的部落领导人所做的
So here is the bottom line.	这就是一条底限
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.	如果你关注一个像这样的部落 它刚好是终极格斗冠军赛 你拉近那些超级人造卫星照相机的镜头 放大图像直到你可以看到单一的个人 事实上你看到的将不再是一个单一的群组 就像这儿也没有一个单一群组一样 但你会看到这些部落正逐步聚合
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.	所以从一定距离看来它就像一个单一的团体
And so people form tribes.	人们所以形成部落
They always have. They always will.	他们总是这么做，他们总是愿意做
Just as fish swim and birds fly, people form tribes.	好比鱼儿水中游，鸟儿天上飞 人类组成部落。
It's just what we do.	天性使然
But here's the rub.	但是这其中也有摩擦
Not all tribes are the same, and what makes the difference is the culture.	并不是所有的部落都是一模一样的 文化让部落产生不同
Now here is the net out of this.	这就是从中产生的网络
You're all a member of tribes.	你们都是部落中的一员
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward, along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.	如果你可以找到一途径带领你所在部落 并推动他们向前 沿着部落的那些发展阶段 直到我们所谓的顶峰——阶段五
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.	但是我们必须从我们称之阶段一的地方开始
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.	这是最底层的阶段
You don't want this.	你们不想要这个。
Okay?	对吧？
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.	把这张图放上屏幕可能有点困难
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.	但是我认为我们应该从中有所学习
Stage One produces people who do horrible things.	阶段一产生 做出可怕事情的人
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.	这是制造弗吉尼亚校园枪击案的那个孩子
Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes, and then pool together with people who think like they do.	阶段一是一些人 他们系统地从功能性的部落切断联系 然后汇集到一起 和那些认同他们所作所为的人一起
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons.	阶段一仅仅是字面意义上的一群人 并且还是犯罪的温床
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.	重申一遍，我们并不常常同阶段一打交道
And I want to make the point that as members of society, we need to.	但我同时需要指出的是 作为社会的成员，我们有这个必要
It's not enough to simply write people off.	简简单单地将他们忽略是远远不够的
But let's move on to Stage Two.	现在让我们转移到阶段二
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."	实际上你会注意到阶段一代表生活糟透了
So, this other book that Steve mentioned, that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance," my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I, argue that as people see the world, so they behave.	这是史蒂夫提到的另一本书 这本书刚刚出版，书名是《执行的三条定律》 我的同事，史蒂夫和我 探讨认为人们怎么看待世界，他们就怎么做
Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks, then their behavior will follow automatically from that.	如果人们以生活糟透了的方式来看待世界的话 然后他们的行为就会自动地遵循这个
It will be despairing hostility.	那将会是绝望中的反抗
They'll do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means undermining other people.	为了生存他们会做任何事 哪怕这意味着要伤害其他人
Now, my birthday is coming up shortly, and my driver's license expires.	我的生日快到了 并且我的驾照已经期满了
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe, which looks like this.	这一切相关的原因是很快 我将会步入一个我们称之为 阶段二的部落 它看起来像这样
Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?	现场笑声 我有说过在每一个车辆管理局 在全国各地，你会发现一个阶段二的文化
No. But in the one near me, where I have to go in just a few days, what I will say when I'm standing in line is, "How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"	不，，但是在我附近的那一个 最近几天我不得不去的那一个 当我排队时我会说 怎么会有人这么笨，但还活得好好的呢？
Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?	我有说是一帮蠢人在这工作吗？
Actually, no, I'm not.	实际上，我没有
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.	但是，我要说是文化让人变笨了
So in a Stage Two culture -- and we find these in all sorts of different places -- you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.	所以在阶段二 我们可以从所有不同的地方发现这一点 实际，你可以从世界上最优秀的组织中发现这些
You find them in all places in society.	你可以从社会中的所有地方发现这些
I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class.	我已经在一些组织中遇到这种情况 在组织中，所有人都叫嚷着要成为最棒的
But here is the point. If you believe and you say to people in your tribe, in effect, "My life sucks.	但问题是，如果你相信这一点并向 你所在部落其他人说了，那事实上 我的生活糟透了
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck.	我的意思是如果我去TED南加州大学演讲， 我的生活不会变糟。
So it does."	但我没去，所以它变糟了。
If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.	如果那是你说话的方式，想象一下，你能够做成什么？
What kind of innovation would get done?	什么样的革新可以完成？
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?	一些改变世界的行为可能发生吗？
In fact it would be basically nil.	实际上这个数字将会是零
Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us.	那么，我们转移到阶段三，这个阶段 与我们每个人的家庭联系最紧密
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.	因为在这个阶段，我们许多人前进
And we park. And we stay.	我们暂停，我们静止
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."	阶段三说：我很伟大，但你没有
I'm great and you're not.	我很伟大，但你没有
Now imagine having a whole room of people saying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."	想象一下，一整个屋子的人 都在说，我很伟大，但你没有
Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that."	或者我将找到一些与你竞争的方法 并且得到最好的结果
A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.	一整个团体的人都这样交流，这样谈话
I know this sounds like a joke.	我知道听起来想一个笑话。
Three doctors walk into a bar.	三个医生进了一家酒吧
But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.	但是，在这个例子中，三个医生进了一个电梯
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.	我刚好在那个电梯里，为本书收集数据
And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine?"	一个医生说道：你们看到了我的论文 发表在了新英格兰医学期刊上了
And the other said, "No.	其他人说：不。
That's great.	那很棒。
Congratulations!"	恭喜你
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said, "Well while you were, you know, doing your research," -- notice the condescending tone -- "While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."	下一个人面带扭曲的微笑说道， 你知道的，当你做你的研究时 注意那种居高临下的语气 当你做研究时，我做了更多的手术 比其他任何在这个部门的人还要多
And the third one got the same wry smile and said, "Well, while you were off doing your research, and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery, that eventually we'll train monkeys to do, or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all, I was off running the future of the residency program, which is really the future of medicine."	第三个人面带同样扭曲的微笑说道 当你做你的研究时 而你做你的猴子肉丸手术时 最终我们将训练猴子做那个手术 或者是细胞，或者是机器人，或者其他可能的需要 我一直在运作居民项目的未来 那才真正是医学的未来
And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.	另外两个人略带笑意并轻拍了他的后背
And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.	然后电梯门开了，他们都走了出去
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.	这就是一个阶段三下的会谈
Now, we find these in places where really smart, successful people show up.	我们发现这些 会在一些真正聪明和成功的人中发生
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.	比如，我不是很明确，TED南加州大学演讲
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.	这里我们将遇到革新中的最大的挑战
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four.	这就是从阶段三 过渡到阶段四
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.	让我们来看一小段视频
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.	这是一家叫Zappos，坐落在拉斯维加斯城外的公司
And my question on the other side is just going to be, "What do you think they value?"	我的问题将会是 你认为他们珍惜的价值是什么
It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.	这不是在圣诞期间，那有一棵圣诞树
This is their lobby.	这是他们的工作间
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.	雇员志愿在他们的工作台上花费时间
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.	注意，这像是从花生卡通中出来的某物
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.	好的，现在我们将穿过Zappos的门厅
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.	这是一个呼叫中心，注意一下它是怎么装修的
Notice people are applauding for us.	看，人们在向我们鼓掌
They don't know who we are and they don't care.	他们不知道我们是谁，他们也不在乎。

But they value things like fun.	他们珍重像乐趣之类的事。
And they value creativity.	他们珍重创造力。
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."	他们宣告的一条价值观就是：变得一点点古怪。
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.	你会发现他们确实有点古怪
So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence, then something very important happens.	所以当个体聚集 并且发现一些团结起他们的事 这比他们间的竞争更伟大 然后一些很重要的事发生了
The group gels. And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger, into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.	这个团体凝聚成一体，而且它从 一个团体高动力 但是平均个人自我为中心 变得更大 变成一个开始关注自我存在的部落
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.	阶段四的部落能过做出非凡的事情
But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.	但你也注意到了我们还没有到达顶峰
There is, in fact, another stage.	事实上，那还有一个阶段
Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.	现在，你们当中一些人可能还没有认识到上面的那一阶段
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great," this may seem a little incongruous.	如果你看一下阶段五的标题，生活很伟大 这看上去有一点不协调
This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.	这是一个场景或片断 摘自于 在南非的真相与和解的进程 因为这个德斯蒙德 图图获得了诺贝尔奖

And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance was people's values and their noble cause, what this group accomplished was historic.	在这种氛围中，唯一的指导 就是人们的价值，他们的崇高事业 这个团体完成的是历史性的
And people, at the time, feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone, descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end.	在那时，人们担心南非 会在卢旺达曾经走过的那条路上走向灭亡 不断分解的小冲突 在内战中似乎没有尽头
In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.	事实上，南非并没有走这条道路
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.	很大程度上是由于像德斯蒙德 图图这样的人 建立起一个阶段五程序 涉及到上千个也可能是上百万个 这个国家中的部落，来让每个人到一起

I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.	我和他们一样不愿谈 特别是在机动车管理局，那里离戴夫住的地方很近
I really don't want to just say "I'm great," because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.	我确实不愿意仅仅就说我很伟大 因为这听上去有点自恋，然后我将不会交到任何朋友
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.	说，我们很伟大，这听上去好多了
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."	但我将好好谈论阶段五，生活很伟大
Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this.	事实上，这里有三条有悖直觉的发现 从所有这些研究结果中产生
The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it, the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights.	第一条，如果你打开独立宣言 并真正读一读 在我们脑中不可磨灭的语句是 关于不可剥夺的权利的一些事
I mean, that's Stage Five, right?	我意思，那是阶段五，对吗？
Life is great, oriented only by our values, no other guidance.	生活很伟大 仅仅由我们的价值观引导 而没有其他的导向
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.	事实上，宣言大部分还停留在阶段二

Two percent are at Stage One.	2%的人处在阶段一
About 25 percent are at Stage Two, saying, in effect, "My life sucks."	大约25%的人在阶段二 说着，我的生活糟透了
48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes, say, "I'm great and you're not."	48%的工薪阶层，那些受雇的部落 说道，我很伟大，但你没有
And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.	我们不得不每天，所以我们诉诸于政治

Only two percent, only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five.	仅仅只有2%，仅仅只有2%的部落 到达了阶段五
And those are the ones that change the world.	那些才是改变世界的
So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society.	所以从中我们有一个小发现 那就是领导者要能够与所有层次的人交流 那样他才可以解触到社会中的所有人
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?	但别离开他们所在的阶段，好吗？
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.	部落仅仅可以听到与之相邻的上下两个阶段的
So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels, to go to where they are.	所以我们得拥有与所有层次交谈的能力 有到达他们所在的能力
And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level.	然后领导者推动部落中的 人们到达下一个阶段
I'd like to show you some examples of this.	我将给你们展示几个例子
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan, former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.	弗兰克 乔丹是我们的一个访谈对象 他是旧金山前任市长，在此之前 他是旧金山警察局局长
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.	基本上，他在阶段一中长大

It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.	那是步入 一个男孩女孩俱乐部
Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.	这就是发生在他身上的事 最终让他成为了旧金山市长
He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks, despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" -- to walking into a Boys and Girls Club, folding his arms, sitting down in a chair, and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.	他从有活力有激情地活在 阶段一，记着，生活糟透了 令人绝望的敌意，我将会为了生存做任何事 发展到，进入一个男孩女孩俱乐部 坐在一张椅子上，袖手旁观 说道，哇哦，我的生活确实糟透了，
I don't know anybody.	我不认识任何人
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck.	我意思是，如果我去拳击，像他们一样 我的生活就不会糟糕。

So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."	所以我要坐在这并且什么也不做
In fact, that's progress.	事实上，这就是进步
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then, over time, getting them connected.	我们推动人们从阶段一进入阶段二 就是将他们引入一个新的部落 并在一段时间内保持联系
So, what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four?	那么，从阶段三到阶段四 又是怎么样呢？
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.	我想申明，这就是我们此刻在做的
TED represents a set of values, and as we unite around these values, something really interesting begins to emerge.	TED代表了一系列的价值观 当我们聚集在这些价值下时 一些真正有趣的事开始显现
If you want this experience to live on as something historic, then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking.	如果你想拥有这样的经历，活着 能有某种历史意义 所以在今晚的聚会，我要鼓励你们做一些事 有悖人们通常所做的事 呼叫网络
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them.	这不再仅是简单的见一些新的面孔 扩大你的交际圈和影响力 取而代之的是发现一些你不认识的人 再发现一些你不认识的人 然后将他们相互引见
That's called a triadic relationship.	这就是所谓的三元关系
See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.	建立改变世界的部落的人做的就是这些
They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them, not just to myself, so that my following is greater, but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves.	他们向外延伸他们的部落 联系他们，而不仅是对我自己 因此我的跟随者就更多 我将互不认识的人联系到 一些比他们自己更伟大的事上来
And ultimately that adds to their values.	并最终这些添加到他们的价值观中去了
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four, which is great, to Stage Five?	但我们还没有完成，因为我们该怎么从阶段四 到更伟大的阶段，阶段五呢？
The story that I like to end with is this.	下面我将以一个故事结尾。
It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization.	它发生在 一个叫盖洛普组织的中
You know they do polls, right?	你知道的，他们是做调查的，对吗？
So it's Stage Four. We're great.	它属于阶段四的。

Pretty much everybody else who does polls.	也有其他许多人在做调查
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll.	如果盖洛普和NBC同一天发布了一个调查 人们会关注盖洛普的调查。

So here is the question someone asked.	这是某个人剔除的问题

And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.	他们发现一个途径去开展第一个全球调查
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics, who reported being bored.	他们的调查涉及，诺贝尔 经济学奖得主，对调查厌烦的普通人
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population of Sub-Saharan Africa?	突然他们抽出一叠问卷 试图弄明白，我们怎么调查 撒哈拉以南非洲的人口
How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology, and speak languages we don't speak, and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages.	我们怎么调查技术无法到达的人口 与我们说不通语言的人口 并且我们不认识任何一个说这种语言的人。
Because in order to achieve on this great mission, we have to be able to do it.	 但为了 完成这个伟大的使命 我们必须能够掌握它

You're hearing one presentation after another, often representing a group of people, a tribe, about how they have changed the world.	你听到一个接一个的问题 通常代表着一群人，一个部落 关于他们怎么改变世界
If you do what we've talked about, you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.	如果你做我们刚才谈论的，你听取了 人们怎么在你所在的部落中交流
And you don't leave them where they are.	你不脱离他们。
You nudge them forward.	你推动他们向前
You remember to talk all five culture stages.	你记得与所有五个文化阶段对话
Because we've got people in all five, around us.	因为我们的周围充斥着所有这五个阶段的人
And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this: Will your tribes change the world?	我将留给你们的问题是 你的部落将会改变世界吗？
Thank you very much.	非常感谢
The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden.	全球医疗事业最大的讽刺在于 那些最为贫穷的国家 同时也是最为病魔缠身的国家
If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest, we see that Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.	如果我们对全球各国 按各种疾病的严重程度进行排序的话 我们会发现撒哈拉沙漠以南的非洲 是艾滋病最为肆虐的地区
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.	而这是世界上目前最致命的传染性疾病
We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.	我们还会发现这一地区 在应对艾滋病方面恰恰是最无能为力的
There are very few doctors and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics.	那里缺乏医生 而且老实说，那些国家根本不具备 应对艾滋病的 必要物资
So what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications.	西方发达国家 为他们慷慨解囊 免费提供药品 给所有第三世界国家 给买不起这些药的人们
And this has already saved millions of lives, and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.	这种义举已经挽救了数以百万计的生命 也把撒哈拉南部非洲各国的经济 从沉没边缘挽救了回来
But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease, because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.	但还有一个最基本的问题 就是抗艾滋斗争 为此拖了后腿 那就是，假如你不停提供药品 给那些 得不到有效诊断的人们 就会导致病毒抗药性增强的问题
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.	这个现象已开始在萨哈拉以南非洲地区显现
The problem is that, what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem.	问题在于 始于第三世界国家的悲剧 很容易就会演变为全球性的问题
And the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.	我们最不愿意见到的事情 就是产生了抗药性的艾滋病毒 在全球各地疯狂传播 这样一来要治好它就会逾发昂贵 从而导致人类抗艾斗争重回 抗逆转录病毒药物出现前的黑暗时代
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda.	我在乌干达上中学的时候 就曾亲眼目睹过这样一个时代
This was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic, before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.	那是上世纪90年代 艾滋病流行最高峰时期的事儿了 当时萨南非洲还没有任何的抗逆转录病毒药
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV/AIDS.	那几年中，我大多数的亲人 还有给我上课的老师 都死于艾滋病
So this became one of the driving passions of my life, to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems.	所以，我人生中最大的目标之一 就是寻找一个有效的办法 来解决这个问题
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.	我们都见识过微型化技术的神奇
Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room, and people actually used to work inside the computers.	从前的电脑能填满这一整个屋子 人们使用它的时候还得钻到它里面去
But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone.	但是随着电子技术微型化的发展 人们已经可以把最新的科技成果 缩到一个手机那么小的体积
So, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips.	所以，如今，我们可以把 生化实验室 给微缩到微流体芯片上
I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school, and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices.	我很幸运 高中毕业之后就直接来到美国 并且还能参与这项技术的研究 为它研发相关设备
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.	这就是我发明的一种微流体芯片
A close look at how the technology works: These are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system.	我来详细解释一下这种技术的工作原理： 这些管道跟人的头发差不多粗细 你可以在上面装上阀门、泵、注射器和混合器 把整套诊断化验设备 都装到一个微流体芯片上去
So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system.	我想做的是 利用目前的 这种技术 来把一个艾滋病化验室 集成到一个芯片上去
So, with one microfluidic chip, which is the size of an iPhone, you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time.	那样，只要有一个 跟iPhone差不多大小的芯片 就可以同时诊断 上百位病人
For each patient, we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient.	为每位病人做多达百组的 病毒负荷量检测
And this is only done in four hours, 50 times faster than the current state of the art, at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options.	这一切仅需四小时 比现有方法快五十倍 价格却只有它的 五百分之一
So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place.	这将允许我们在第三世界国家 创造出个性化治疗的条件 并且价格完全可接受 从而使世界变得更加安全
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality.	我希望大家能关注这项技术 更希望你们能投入进来 使我们的这个愿景 能够早日实现
Thank you very much.	非常感谢
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?	各位知道 有多少中开花植物么？
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.	有25万种 -- 至少我们知道的有这么多 -- 25万中开花植物。
And flowers are a real bugger.	而花儿是个麻烦事。
They're really difficult for plants to produce.	让植物繁育真的很困难。
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.	需要大量的经历和许多资源。
Why would they go to that bother?	为什么会这么困扰？
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.	当然，答案是，与世界上许多其他事物一样， 性别。
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.	我知道当你们看这些图片时脑子里想的是什么。
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.	有性繁殖如此重要的原因 -- 植物有许多其他的方式可以繁殖。
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.	可以用插枝的方式； 可以同株两性繁殖； 可以同株授粉。
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.	但它们确实需要传播它们的基因 与其他的基因混合， 这样它们才能生态环境。
Evolution works that way.	进化就是这样起作用的。
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.	现在植物传递这一信息的途径 是通过花粉。
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.	你们中一些人或许之前已经看过这些图片了。
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.	如我所说，每个家庭都应该有一台能看到这些的 扫描电子显微镜。
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.	有多少种开花植物就有 多少种不同类型的花粉。
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.	这其实对法医学等等相当有用。
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.	多数会导致我们患上花粉热的花粉 来自那些用风来 传播花粉的植物。 这是个非常低效的过程， 这也是为什么花粉总是跑到我们鼻子里。
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.	因为其中大多数都被抛弃了， 希望包含在花粉中的生殖细胞， 雄性生殖细胞， 将能碰巧落到另一朵花上。
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.	所有的草，这意味着所有的谷物， 和多数的树 靠风传播花粉。
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.	但多数物种 实际上利用昆虫来完成这一过程。 在某种程度上这更聪明， 因为这样并不需要太多的花粉。
The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.	昆虫 和其他物种 能携带花粉， 把花粉直接转移到所需的地方去。
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.	很显然，我们注意到 昆虫和植物之间的关系。
There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.	这是种共生关系， 无论是鸟儿还是蜜蜂， 它们都能获得回报， 通常获得的回报是花蜜。
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.	有时这种共生关系 会导致奇妙的适应性变化 -- 红裙小天蛾 是一种漂亮的适应性变化。
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.	植物也有收获， 天峨把花粉传播到了别处。
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.	植物进化了， 到处创建降落的跑道， 蜜蜂可能迷失其中。
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.	许多植物上有些 看起来像是其他昆虫的标记。
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.	这些是百合花的花粉囊， 非常巧妙， 因此当毫不知情的昆虫 落于其上时， 花粉囊翻转过来，带着许多花粉 击打在昆虫背部，这样就能跟随昆虫到其他植物那里。
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.	有一种兰花 看起来就像是有下颚一般。 在某种程度上说，它的确有；它强迫昆虫爬过， 沾上花粉，并把花粉带往别的地方。
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.	兰花：至少有 两万种兰花 -- 多种多样的令人惊异。
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.	它们有各种各样的花招。
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.	它们必须尝试并吸引传粉者 帮助它们完成这一过程。
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.	这株兰花，被称为达尔文的兰花， 因为它曾被达尔文研究 并在他看到这种兰花时给出了奇妙的预测。 可以看到这儿有一个很长的花蜜管 从兰花中 垂下来。
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.	基本上昆虫不得不做的是 -- 我们来到花的当中 -- 它把口器刺入 中间的部分 一路向下知道花蜜管 以得到花蜜。
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."	达尔文说，看看这花， 我猜测有些事物与其共同进化了。
And sure enough, there's the insect.	毫无疑问， 就是昆虫。
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.	我的意思时，通常它都是卷起来的， 但它伸直以后， 看起来是这样的。
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.	现在可以想象一下 如果花蜜 这种如此有价值的事物 对植物来说生产的代价高昂 且又能吸引许多传粉者， 那么，就如在人类性行为中的那样， 人们或许开始相互欺骗。
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar.	它们或许会说，我有些花蜜。
Do you want to come and get it?"	你想来拿点么？
Now this is a plant.	这是一株植物。
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.	这株植物 为南非的昆虫所喜爱。 它们进化出了长长的口器 以获取底部的花蜜。
And this is the mimic.	这是个模仿者。
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.	这种植物在模仿前一种植物。
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar.	有一种长着长口器的苍蝇 它从假冒者那儿没得到任何花蜜。
It thought it would get some.	它以为它可以得到。
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.	因此，不但苍蝇 没有从假冒的植物那儿得到花蜜， 而且 -- 如果你非常近的观察 头的顶部，你会看到那儿有些花粉 这些花粉将被传播到其他植株上， 如果没有植物学家过来 把它粘到一张蓝色卡片上的话。
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.	这种谎言遍布整个植物王国。
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.	这朵带着黑点的花： 它们或许在我们看来像是黑点， 但我告诉各位，对适当物种的雄性昆虫来说， 这看起来像是两只 非常非常性感的雌性。
And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.	当昆虫到达并在上面着陆时， 把自己浸入花粉中，当然，这些花粉将会被它带到其他植物那儿去， 如果看看每个家庭都应该有的扫描电子显微镜的图像， 就能看到实际上那儿有些图案， 三维的图案。
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.	它甚至能让昆虫感觉到舒服， 看起来也不错。
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.	这些电子显微镜图像 -- 这是一朵兰花在伪装成一只昆虫 -- 你能看到对我们的眼睛来说， 结构的不同部分有着不同的色彩和不同的纹理, 而昆虫或许能感知到 非常非常不同的纹理。
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.	这种兰花进化至能模仿 在一些甲壳虫身上看到的 有金属光泽的表面。
And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.	在扫描电子显微镜下 你能看到这表面 -- 这与我们看过的其他表面非常不同。
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.	有时整个植物会 模仿成一只昆虫，即使我们看来也像是昆虫。
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.	我的意思是，我认为这看起来像是某种飞行的动物或野兽。
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.	是美妙而神奇的事物。
This one's clever.	这是它的聪明之处。
It's called obsidian.	它被称为黑曜石。
I think of it as insidium sometimes.	我认为它有时是狡猾的。
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.	对于适合种类的蜜蜂来说， 这看起来像是另一只非常有侵略性的蜜蜂， 它会飞过来用头撞击它许多许多次，试着赶走它， 当然，这会让它沾上花粉。
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.	它做的另一件事是 这种植物模仿成另一种 富含昆虫喜爱的 食物的兰花。
And this one doesn't have anything for them.	但其实什么也没有。
So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.	因此它在两个层面上进行欺骗 -- 真难以置信。
Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.	我们看到的是依兰， 有浓烈香味的部分。
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.	实际上我之前闻到过。
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.	这些花实际上没有必要这么艳丽。
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.	它们散发出奇妙的香味 吸引任何有兴趣的昆虫。
This one doesn't smell so good.	这朵花闻起来不怎么样。
This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.	这朵花 实际上闻起来非常难闻 再提一次，这是进化而来， 它看起来像是腐肉。
So flies love this.	因此苍蝇喜欢它。
They fly in and they pollinate.	苍蝇飞进去并帮其授粉。
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.	这是白星海芋， 也被称作死马海芋。
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.	我不知道死马闻起来什么味儿， 但这朵花或许闻起来非常像。
It's really horrible.	实在太可怕了。
And blowflies just can't help themselves.	绿头蝇情不自禁。
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.	飞入其中， 一路飞入其中。
They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.	在上面产卵， 认为这是块很不错的腐肉， 没有意识到这儿可没有卵的食物，这些卵会死在这儿， 但同时这株植物会受益， 因为硬毛松开 苍蝇消失了， 授粉至另一朵花 -- 太奇妙了。
Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.	这是海芋植物，欧海芋， 斑叶阿若母，在这个国家称为延龄草。
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.	我上周在多塞特拍摄的这个。
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.	这家伙加热升温 比环境温度大约高15度 -- 不可思议。
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.	如果看看它内部， 肉穗后面是个有点像大坝的东西， 苍蝇为热量所吸引 -- 这是种沸腾的挥发性化学物质，小虫 -- 它们被困在这一容器下面。
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.	它们痛饮甜美的花蜜 接着都变得有点黏糊糊的。
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.	在夜里它们被花粉覆盖， 由它们上面喷洒而下， 然后我们在上面看到的硬毛 变得枯萎让这些浑身花粉的小虫得以逃出 -- 真是难以置信。
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.	如果你认为这是难以置信的，这一个是我的最爱。
This is the philodendron selloum.	这是春羽蔓绿绒。
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.	在座从巴西来的人，应该都知道这种植物。
This is the most amazing thing.	这是最神奇的事物。
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.	它的雄蕊 有大约一英尺长。
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.	它有一种 据我所知没任何其他植物拥有的能力， 当它盛开时 -- 这是在中间的肉穗 -- 大约两天时间， 它产生了某种程度的代谢变化 有些类似哺乳动物。
So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.	并没拥有淀粉， 这是植物的食物， 它拥有十分类似褐色脂肪的东西 以燃烧脂肪的速度 燃烧它，进行代谢， 大约以一只小猫的速度进行。
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.	按体重比，是蜂鸟的能量输出的 两倍 -- 绝对惊人。
This thing does something else which is unusual.	它还做了些不寻常的事。
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.	不仅是它将升温至155华氏度， 43或44摄氏度，两天， 而且它将保持恒温。
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.	其中有一个温度调节机制 用于保持恒温。
"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.	为什么要这么做？我听到你们问。
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.	目前你们还不知道， 有些甲壳虫就喜欢在这一温度下交配。
And they get inside, and they get it all on.	它们钻进去，沾满花粉。
And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.	植物在它们身上撒满花粉， 让它们离开，去授粉。
And what a wonderful thing it is.	这是多么奇妙的事情啊。
Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.	现在我们认为 大多数传粉者是昆虫， 但实际上在热带地区， 许多鸟类和蝴蝶也进行传粉。
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.	许多热带的花朵是红色的， 这是因为蝴蝶和鸟类 与我们相似，我们认为， 能非常好的看到红色。
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.	但如果你看看光谱， 鸟类和我们，我们看到红色，绿色和蓝色 看到这一光谱。
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.	昆虫看到绿色，蓝色和紫外线， 它们能看到各种明暗的紫外线。
So there's something that goes on off the end there.	在这后面还有些色彩。
"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.	如果我们能看到那些颜色难道不好吗，我听到你们问。
Well yes we can.	是的，我们能看到。
So what is an insect seeing?	那么昆虫看到的是什么？
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.	上周我拍了这些沙漠座莲的照片， 半日花属，在多塞特。
These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.	正如我们所看到的，这是些小黄花， 到处都是这种小黄花。
And this is what it looks like with visible light.	在可见光下它看起来是这样的。
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.	如果去除红色看起来是这样。
Most bees don't perceive red.	多数蜜蜂无法感知红色。
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.	接着我在我的镜头前放上紫外线滤镜 在紫外线特定的频率下 长时间的曝光， 就得到了这张照片。
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.	这像是个真实的奇妙的靶心。
Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.	现在我们不知道 蜜蜂到底看到的是什么， 当我称之为红色时， 你们知道我在看什么。
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.	我们无法知道其中发生了什么，不管是昆虫， 还是其他人类的脑中。
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.	但对比度看起来大概是这样。 从背景中突显出来。
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.	这是另一种小花 -- 位于不同的紫外线频率区间， 不同的滤镜 来匹配不同的传粉者。
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.	它看起来大概是这样。
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.	为了避免你们认为 所有黄色的花都有这一属性 -- 在拍摄的过程中没有损伤花朵； 只是把它贴在三脚架上， 没有摘下来 -- 在紫外光下， 看看这个。
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.	这能作为防晒霜的基础， 因为防晒霜是通过吸收紫外光来起作用的。
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.	因此或许其中的化学物质有些用处。
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.	最后，这是一朵夜来香 是挪威的Bjorn Rorslett发给我的 -- 奇妙的隐藏模式。
And I love the idea of something hidden.	我喜欢这种隐藏的方式。
I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.	我觉得这很有诗意。 这些照片是用紫外线滤镜拍摄的， 这种滤镜的主要用途是 天文学家用来拍摄金星 -- 实际上是金星上的云层。
That's the main use of that filter.	这是这种滤镜的主要用途。
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.	当然，金星是爱与生育之神， 这是花的物语。
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.	正如花朵们花了这么多精力 尝试吸引传粉者接受它们的邀请， 不知何故，它们也成功地让我们相信其中含有丰富内涵 我们在出生和逝世时 相互送出花朵， 尤其是婚礼时， 当你想到它时， 就在这一刻内 基因物质从 迁移一个有机体到另一个。
Thank you very much.	非常感谢。
The theme of my talk today is, "Be an artist, right now."	我今天演讲的主题是： 做个艺术家吧，现在就开始！
Most people, when this subject is brought up, get tense and resist it: "Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.	大多数对听到这个主题可能都会变得很紧张 并且对其满是抗拒 艺术不适合我，我现在很忙啦
I have to go to school, get a job, send my kids to lessons ... " You think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."	我得上学啊、找工作啊， 我要送孩子去上学啊 你觉得，你太忙了，你没有时间玩艺术
There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.	我们拒绝艺术的理由千种万种，
Don't they just pop into your head?	这些理由是不是总是会突然冒出来？
There are so many reasons why we can't be, indeed, we're not sure why we should be.	我们有千百种理由没法做个艺术家， 但事实上，我们只是不清楚我们为什么应该做艺术家。
We don't know why we should be artists, but we have many reasons why we can't be.	我们只是不知道我们为什么要做艺术家， 但我们却找各种理由说服自己做不了艺术家。
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?	为什么人们会条件反射般的抵触艺术？
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.	也许你会认为艺术只是那些天赋异禀的人才能玩得起的， 或者是那些透彻地受过专业艺术教育的人才能参与的。
And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.	而有些人也许还觉得自己离艺术太远了。
Well you might have, but I don't think so.	也许你真的离艺术很远，但我却不这么认为。
This is the theme of my talk today.	而这便是我今天演讲的主题。
We are all born artists.	人人生来都是艺术家。
If you have kids, you know what I mean.	如果你有小孩,你就会明白。
Almost everything kids do is art.	几乎所有的小孩都会摆弄点艺术。
They draw with crayons on the wall.	他们用蜡笔在墙上画画。
They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV, but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.	他们对着电视里孙丹菲的舞蹈翩翩起舞， 他们跳的舞都不像是孙丹菲的舞蹈， 而是具有他们自己风格的舞蹈。
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.	孩子们跳一些奇怪的舞， 并用自己的歌声伴奏。
Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear, and because they practice such art all day long, people honestly get a little tired around kids.	也许他们创造的艺术，只有他们的父母们才能欣赏 并且他们一天到晚都在进行这一类艺术创作， 所以人们其实跟这些孩子们在一起久了都会感到厌倦。
Kids will sometimes perform monodramas -- playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.	孩子们有时候会一个人演部戏， 过家家实际上就是一种独角戏。
And some kids, when they get a bit older, start to lie.	有些孩子长大一些后， 会开始撒谎。
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.	父母们通常都会记得孩子第一次撒谎的情景。
They're shocked.	父母们会觉得很震惊。
"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"	妈妈会说：你开始显露你的真面目了， 她会想：为什么孩子会学父亲撒谎？
She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"	妈妈会质问孩子：你到底会成为一个什么样的人？
But you shouldn't worry.	但其实你不用担心。
The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.	孩子们开始撒谎的时候就是他们开始创造故事的时候。
They are talking about things they didn't see.	他们所说的东西是他们从没见过的。
It's amazing.	这很神奇。

Parents should celebrate.	父母们应该感到高兴。
"Hurray!	太好了，我孩子...我孩子终于开始撒谎了！
My boy finally started to lie!"	
All right! It calls for celebration.	这是需要庆祝的
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what?	例如一个孩子说：妈妈，你知道吗？
I met an alien on my way home."	 我今天回家路上遇见一个外星人
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."	一个一般的母亲可能会回答：别瞎说。
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really?	而好的父母却会这样回答： 真的吗？

Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels, "Flaubert did not write a novel.	罗兰·巴特曾经评价福楼拜的小说时说道： 福楼拜写的不仅仅是小说
He merely connected one sentence after another.	他不仅仅是将一个句子连接在另一个句子后面
The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."	字里行间的爱才是福楼拜小说的精华所在。
That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence, then, without violating the scope of the first one, writing the next sentence.	这就对了——一部小说，基本上先写一个句子 然后再在第一个句子的基础上 写下一个句子。
And you continue to make connections.	你会继续进行连接。
Take a look at this sentence: Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."	来看一下这个句子： 这就是弗朗兹•卡夫卡《变形记》中的第一个句子。

It's a bit mischievous, actually.	事实上，这句话有一点促狭的，

Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.	不幸的是，在某些时候我们的艺术 如此愉悦的消遣 — 已经结束了。
Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons, but they aren't fun anymore.	孩子们不得不去学习、去学校、做作业 当然他们也会上钢琴课、芭蕾课， 但是他们不再因此而快乐。

Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.	说说我的故事： 我在景福宫学校8年级的时候参加了一个绘画比赛，
I was trying my best, and my teacher came around and asked me, "What are you doing?"	我尽了自己最大的努力，然后我的老师走过来 问我，你在干什么？

"You'll get it!"	他说，太不像话了
You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc., but I was coloring everything in black, so he dragged me out of the group.	 但我把所有的都涂成了黑色， 所以他把我赶了出去。
There were a lot of girls there as well, so I was utterly mortified.	当时那里还有许多女孩子在场， 我感到特别囧
None of my explanations or excuses were heard, and I really got it big time.	完全没有听我的解释或是借口 我真的是受到了奇耻大辱。
If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before, "Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing, but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.	如果他是一个好老师，他就会象我刚才那么说， 英涵也许不是一个画画的人才， 但他具有编造故事的天赋，而且他也会鼓励我。

Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation -- essentially the same as I did.	不管怎样，20世纪的当代艺术 就是做些怪异的东西，用说明和解释填充空隙—— 本质上跟我以前做的差不多。

That was Duchamp.	这是杜尚。
So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories -- that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.	所以用故事填充解释和怪异行为之间的沟壑—— 这就是关于当代艺术的一切。

And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about the power of, and importance of, independent media than I could say in an hour.	我发现这个短片在29秒内所表达的 独立媒体的威力和重要性 比我讲一个小时的话还要有力。
So I thought that it will be good to start with it.	所以我认为今天的演讲以它开头很恰当。

According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press.	据有关研究表明，这个星球上83％的人口 生活在没有独立媒体的社会中。

But that's totally another and separate topic.	那完全是另一个话题了。
So I can go back to my story.	所以现在回到我自己的故事。
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991.	我要讲的故事始于1991年。
At that time I was running B92, the only independent, for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.	那时我在办B92，是整个国家唯一的独立、 甚至是唯一的电子媒体。
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment, where government really wants to make your life miserable.	我想那时我们的处境——我们过的是一个国家里 唯一独立媒体司空见惯的生活——政府非制你于悲惨境地中不可， 这样一个敌对的环境下。
And there are different ways.	他们运用各种方式，
Yeah, it was the usual cocktail: a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice, a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control, so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.	也就是那些惯用伎俩： 一点儿威胁，一点儿友善建议， 一点儿经济管制，一点儿文字控制。 所以总有这么一个人从不离开我们的办公室。
But what they really do, which is very powerful, and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing if they don't like independent media companies -- you know, they threaten your advertisers.	但是他们真正做的一件很有威力的， 也就是90年代后期那些政府开始做的一件事，就是 如果他们不喜欢独立媒体公司， 他们就威胁你的广告客户。
Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually, you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come -- no matter how much does it make sense for them -- do not want to come and advertise.	一旦他们威胁你的广告商， 市场力量实际上就被毁害了， 不管那些广告商有多少理由应该来， 他们都不愿再来刊登广告了。
And you have a problem making ends meet.	这下你的生计就出问题了。
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem, which was, you know, survival below one side, but what was really painful for me was, remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.	当时在90年代初期，我们遇到的难题 一方面是生存， 但最让我痛心的是我以下要讲的。 大家记得，90年代初，南斯拉夫正在瓦解。
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall, in a slow-motion downfall.	我们在一旁观望一个国家垮台， 慢动作一般的垮台。
And we all had all of that on tapes.	我们把这一切都录了下来。
We had the ability to understand what was going on.	我们有能力了解整个事件的过程。
We were actually recording history.	其实就是在纪录历史。
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later; because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history.	问题是一周后，我们要重录历史， 因为如果不重录，我们买不起足够的录像带 将那段历史存档。
So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.	我只想给大家一个概况，不在说这件事上多费时间。
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.	在那样一个背景下，一位先生来到我的办公室。
It was still 1991.	当时还是1991年。
He was running a media systems organization which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.	那位先生在经营一家媒体管理机构， 这个机构现在还有生意，这位先生也还有生意。
And what did I know at that time about media systems?	当时我哪懂什么媒体管理啊？
I would think media systems were organizations, which means they should help you.	我认为既然是媒体管理机构， 就应该帮助我们。
So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans: the small one and the big one.	我为同先生的会议制定了两个战略方案： 一个小方案，一个大方案。
The small one was, I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes, so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.	小方案是：我就想让他帮我们 把那些该死的录像带弄到手， 好让我们把完整的档案存放50年。

And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.	第二，我不知道如何将我的主意付诸现实。
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.	从理论的层面看，这是个很好的概念。
But it's one thing to have a concept; it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.	但是有个好概念是一回事， 将其付诸事实又完全是另外一回事。

All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night -- government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption, giving voice to unheard, to poor -- it's why independent media is in business.	昨晚提到的所有问题，至少一半问题—— 政府问责制，腐败，如何反腐败， 给底层人、穷人说话的机会—— 这就是为什么独立媒体有市场，
And it's why it was invented.	就是为什么当初独立媒体会诞生。
So from that perspective, what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.	所以从这个角度看，独立媒体这么大市场 我们做的真是微不足道。
Now ours is just one story.	我们的故事只是一个故事。
I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work.	我相信这间屋子里还有15个关于公益组织 大有作为的精彩故事。
Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.	而这就是问题所在， 我尽我所能给大家解释问题到底是什么。
And it's called fundraising.	问题的名字叫筹资。
Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations.	设想这间屋子这三分之一坐满了 各个基金会的代表。
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations, doing very important work.	另外这三分之二在运作优秀的公益组织， 做着非常重要的工作。
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.	再设想这边有一半人 耳聋，听不见，还在黑暗之中。
Now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room.	把屋子这边的人匹配给 屋子那边的人 的难度就是这样。
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform, to totally rethink fundraising.	所以我们觉得要改革、重新思考筹资， 需要一个大创意。
You know, instead of people running in this dark, trying to find their own match, who will be willing, who has the same goals.	以不至于人人在暗中 盲目寻找志同道合的 对象。
Instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented.	我们认为要发明一种新的筹资方式 来代替原来的方式。
And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds, press freedom bonds.	我们想出了发行债券的主意， 新闻自由债券。
If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit, why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit?	如果有投资者愿给美国政府预算赤字 提供资金， 难道我们就找不到愿给新闻自由赤字 投资的人？
We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them, probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.	我们已经决定了今年秋天就开始发行 估计是面值1000元的债券。
I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.	我不想在这儿给债券做广告，这不是今天讲的要点。
But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them, find enough investors that this can be considered a success, there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring.	要点是，如果我们能存活到发行债券的那一天， 找到足够的投资者而使其成功， 就说不定另一个组织 明年春天开始发行债券。
And those can be environmental bonds.	可能是环保债券。
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds.	可能再过两个星期，伊卡柏·卡迪尔开始 在孟加拉国发行他的电力债券。
And before you know it, any social cause can be actually financed in this way.	不知不觉中，任何一项公益事业 都可以这样融资了。
Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.	现在11：30我们还有55秒的时间做白日梦。
But let's take the idea further.	我们把这个想法再推进一步。
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's, you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.	我们在美国开始做这件事 因为这些概念很贴近美国人的思维方式。
But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.	然而你完全可以把它带到欧洲去，
You can bring it to Asia.	带到亚洲去。
You can, once you have all of those different points, you can make it easy for investors.	当这些地方都在这样做的时候， 你可以把投资变得更简易。
Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click.	把这些债券放在一起， 让投资者坐下来点击。
Once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix.	达到10种债券时 就得制定一些指标。
What do investors get?	投资者获得的是什么？
On one side financial, on the other side social.	一方面是经济利益，一方面是对社会的影响。
So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency, Morningstar type.	由此产生了类似晨星的债券评级机构的 想法。
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.	比如说，某债券对社会影响力很强，给五个星。
Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.	经济回报1％，只给一个星。
Now take it to the last step.	再把这个想法提升到最后一层。
Once you have all of that put together, there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a marketplace for all of that, where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.	一旦这些条件齐全了， 就没有理由不能设立一个 能很快 将这些债券脱手的交易场所。
And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms, no blind people running around to find each other.	这样组织融资 就没有黑屋子，没有人盲目的 互相寻找对方了。
Thank you.	谢谢。
So I really consider myself a storyteller.	我真的觉得自己很会讲故事，
But I don't really tell stories in the usual way, in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.	但是我其实不是用一般的方式讲故事， 也就是说我基本上不讲自己的故事。
Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories, people all around the world.	相反，我对搭建平台 让世界各地的所有人能够讲他们自己的故事 很感兴趣。
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.	我这样做是因为我觉得人有很多共同点。
I think people are very similar, but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.	我觉得人与人之间很相似， 但我也认为人们不太容易发现这些相似点。
You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps, and I think we all see a lot of gaps.	当我纵观世界的时候，我能看到很多的差异，对吧， 我们所有人都能看到很多的差异。
And we define ourselves by our gaps.	其实我们是通过人与人之间的差异来定义我们自己的，
There's language gaps, there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps, there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps, there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps, there's also religious gaps.	对吧，我们有语言差异， 种族差异，年龄差异， 性别差异，性向差异， 财富和金钱差距，教育程度差距， 宗教差异。
You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something, some smaller community.	对吧，我们有所有这些差距和不同，而我觉得人们喜欢这些差异， 因为他们让我们感觉与众不同， 属于不同于大众的小众。
But I think that actually, despite our gaps, we really have a lot in common.	但我也认为尽管我们有那么多的差异， 实际上我们真的也有很多共同点，
And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves.	其中的一个共同点就是我们内心深处 都急需表达自我。
I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.	这是一个非常原始的人类欲求，并不是什么新的概念。
But the thing about self-expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen.	但问题是自古以来 这个表达自我的欲望总得不到满足， 因为虽然我们渴望表达自我， 但是总是找不到那么多有同感的朋友 愿意站在边上听。
This, also, is nothing new.	这也不是什么新发现。
Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art, writing poems, singing songs, scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper, gossiping with friends.	从人类发展伊始，我们就一直试图战胜这种不平衡， 通过制作艺术品，写诗歌，唱歌， 写读后感寄给报社， 与朋友闲扯八卦。
This is nothing new.	这也不是什么新鲜事。
What's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities, these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.	真正的新鲜事是：在过去几年中 很多这些传统的表达自我的人类活动， 已经逐渐转移到互联网上。
And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints, footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.	而在这个过程中，人们会留下了痕迹， 那些他们表达自我时讲的故事的痕迹。
And so what I do is, I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints, and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them -- what they feel, what they think, what's different in the world today than usual, these sorts of questions.	所以我做的事情就是，编程序 搜集和研究大量的这些痕迹， 然后尽量从中得出关于留下痕迹的那些人一些结论， 比如他们有什么感觉，他们想些什么， 今天的世界和以往有哪些不同， 诸如此类的问题。
One project that explores these ideas, which was made about a year ago, is a piece called We Feel Fine.	其中一个探索这些想法的项目 在大概一年前启动， 做一个名字叫作我们感觉不错的程序。
This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world's newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."	这个程序每两三分钟 扫描一下全球新张贴的博客日志， 寻找我觉得或者我正感觉这两个词组。
And when it finds one of those phrases, it grabs the sentence up to the period, and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.	如果发现这些词组， 就提取这一整句话， 然后自动试着推断写这句话的人的 年龄，性别和地理位置。
Then, knowing the geographical location and the time, we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence.	然后，通过获得的地理位置和时间， 我们还可以找到 那个人写那句话当时的天气。
All of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.	所有这些信息都保存在一个数据库里， 每天大约能搜集2万条感觉的数据。
It's been running for about a year and a half.	这个项目已经运行了大概一年半，
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.	至今为止已经搜集了大约750万条人们的感觉。
And I'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized.	现在我大概演示一下 我们把这些信息可视化之后的样子。
So this is We Feel Fine.	请看，这就是我们感觉不错。
What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles, each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours.	你们看到的是一大堆纷乱蠕动的粒子， 每个粒子代表一句 在刚过去的几小时之内发表的感觉。
The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside -- so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.	每个粒子的颜色对应于内心感受的类型： 快乐积极的感觉用鲜艳的色彩表示，
And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.	而伤心消极的情绪用灰暗的颜色表示。
The diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside, so that the large dots contain large sentences, and the small dots contain small sentences.	每个粒子的直径 代表那句话的长度， 因此大的粒子表示较长的句子， 小的粒子代表短的句子。
Any dot can be clicked and expanded.	任何粒子都可以点击显示更多信息。
And we see here, "I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."	请看这句， 如果我现在能蜷缩在他的怀里， 从他怀抱和温柔的嘴唇感觉他对我的爱恋， 我会感觉多好啊。
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions.	可见，有时候这些人类情感世界中的东西 会非常撩人和煽情。
And all of these are stated by people: "I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much, but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond, it's nice to feel bigger again."	而这一切都是人们自己说的。 我知道客观上那并没有多大的意义， 但像大池塘的一条小鱼一样地生活了那么多年之后， 能再感觉变大了是多么美好。
The dots exhibit human qualities.	这些粒子能展示人的特性。
They kind of have their own physics, and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.	他们又像有自己的生命， 疯狂地四处游动，欲探索生命的世界。
And then they also exhibit curiosity.	他们也显示出好奇的模样。
You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.	你们可以看到现在有一些粒子在鼠标周围蠕动，
You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words.	另外一些 在左下角的 6个词周围游动。
Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine.	这6个词代表了我们感觉不错项目的6个模式。
We're currently seeing Madness.	 我们现在看到的是疯狂。
There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.	另外还有悄悄话，剪辑，同党，度量和果冻。
And I'll walk you through a few of those now.	现在我和你们一起看看其中几个。
Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.	悄悄话把所有情绪吹到屏幕顶上。
And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order, they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.	然后，一个接一个的按从新到旧的顺序 自己运行，进到一个滚动的感觉清单里面，
"I feel a bit better now."	我现在感觉好一点了。
"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do."	我感到困惑，不知道我到底想干什么。
"I feel gypped out of something awesome here."	我感觉虽然上当了，但是收获了一些很棒的东西。
"I feel so free; I feel so good."	我觉得很自由，感觉非常好。
"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."	我觉得像是在一团郁闷的迷雾中，不可自拔。
And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected. And in that way, you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy.	你也可以点击任何一个粒子 去查看它们的博客来源，通过这样 就可以与这些博客的作者联系， 如果那些话让你觉得有同感的话。
The next movement is called Montage.	下面这个模式叫作剪辑。
Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid.	剪辑把所有包含照片的感觉抽出来， 显示成一个点阵。
This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours, if you will.	这个照片点阵就代表了 前几个小时的世界情绪，可以这么说。
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.	每一张图片都可以点击放大。
We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun if it's not the both of us."	这里说，我只是觉得如果不是我们两人一起经历的事， 都不会让我开心。
That was from someone in Michigan.	这来自一个密歇根州的人。
We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."	这里说，我感觉24小时都对着电脑。
These are automatically constructed using the found objects: "I think I feel a little full."	这些都是用通过剪辑的设置自动搜索的句子。
The next movement is called mobs.	接下来这个模式称为同党。
Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.	同党对全世界在过去几个小时的感觉 做统计分类。
We see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now, followed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.	我们发现好些了是现在最常见的感觉， 其次是好，不好，愧疚，不错，沮丧，恶心等。
We can also get a gender breakdown.	我们还可以按性别分类。
And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.	我们发现在刚才几个小时中， 女人谈自己的情绪比男人要多。
We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram of the world's emotional distribution by age.	我们也可以按年龄划分， 就能得到世界的情感按照年龄分布的柱状图。
We see people in their twenties are the most prolific, followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties, and it dies out very quickly from there.	可以看到20多岁的人是最活跃的， 然后是青少年，然后是30多岁的人， 其他年龄段的就基本上不怎么讲了。
In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent, so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they're part of the sun.	可以按天气来分类，我们把 感觉特征和天气特征的相似联系起来， 那么那些象征阳光灿烂天气的情绪 不断旋转着，仿佛它们就是太阳的一部分。
The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.	象征多云的情绪飘浮着，仿佛乘风来去。
The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm, and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.	象征下雨情绪的粒子坠落下来，就像是在下暴雨。 象征下雪的粒子就像雪花一样洒落地面。
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.	最后，按位置分类可以把感觉的来源地 显示在世界地图上，显示出那些感觉的地理分布。
Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.	度量对数据提供更多的数量分析。
We see that the world is feeling "used" at 3.3 times the normal level right now.	可以看到，现在世界上感觉被利用了的程度 是平常的3.3倍。
They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.	他们正感到比平时温暖2.9倍，等等。
Other views are also available.	还有其他的数量分析。
Here are gender, age, weather, location.	刚才看的是性别，年龄，天气，位置。
The final movement is called Mounds.	最后一个模式被称作山丘。
It's a bit different from the others.	这个跟刚才的几个有点不同。
Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle.	山丘把整个数据库形象地表示为大果冻似的的小山， 有点摇晃。
And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.	如果按住鼠标，他们会抖动。
We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."	我们看见好些了是最常见的感觉，其次是不好。
And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll, and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.	然后如果我移到这里，列表就开始滚动， 这里实际上已经收集了成千上万的感觉。
You can see the little pink cursor moving along, representing our position.	你可以看到这个粉红色的光标在移动， 代表我们的位置。
Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."	这里我们看到人们感到下滑，恶心，负责。
There's also a search capability, if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.	如果你想看看具体某些人的情况的话， 它还有搜索功能。
For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted" in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.	比如说，你可能发现 在孟加拉国多云的时候更多女人们希望她们能永远20岁
But I'll spare you that.	关于这个我就不多说了。
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected: "I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me."	那么这里是我收集的最喜欢的一些剪辑： 我觉得爸爸给我的爱多到都没有我自己存在的地方了。
"I feel very lonely."	我感到很孤独。
"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful."	我要到一些边远的乡村去， 那样我才觉得自己漂亮。
"I feel invisible to you."	我觉得你眼中没有我。
"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."	我不会隐瞒，除非这个社会非逼我这么做。
"I feel in love with Carolyn."	我觉得爱上了卡罗琳。
"I feel so naughty."	 我觉得我很调皮。
"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."	我觉得这些怪人根本是大学生活的财富所在。
"I love how I feel today."	我爱今天的感觉。
So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call "passive observation."	所以你们可以看到，我们感觉不错项目用了一个 叫被动观察的技术，
What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives.	意思是说它被动地观察人们的生活。
It scans the world's blogs and looks at what people are writing, and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.	 它扫描全世界的博客， 看人们写些什么， 而人们不知道有东西在观察他们。
And because of that, you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses that are often very moving.	所以 人们就非常诚实，坦率而真挚的回帖 常常相当感人。
And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work because people don't know they're being interviewed.	这是我在工作中通常喜欢用的一种技术， 因为人们不知道自己被观察。
They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.	他们只是过自己的生活，就是平时最自然的状态。
Another technique is directly questioning people.	另一种方法是直接提问。
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project, the Yahoo! Time Capsule, which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.	这是我在另一个项目雅虎时间胶囊 摸索出来的技术， 这个项目的目的是总结2006年的世界的个性特征。
It was divided into ten very simple themes -- love, anger, sadness and so on -- each of which contained a single, very open-ended question put to the world: What do you love?	它分成10个非常简单的主题—— 爱，生气，悲伤等—— 每个主题都是向全世界提的一个没有固定答案的问题： 你爱什么？
What makes you angry?	你为什么而生气？
What makes you sad?	什么会让你伤心？
What do you believe in?	你相信什么？
And so on.	等等。
The time capsule was available for one month online, translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.	这个时间胶囊放在网上一个月， 翻译成10种语言，看进来是这个样子，
It's a spinning globe, the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule.	一个旋转的球， 球表面完全由人们发送给时间胶囊的 照片，文字和图画 组成。
The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.	这10个主题成辐射状围着时间胶囊旋转。
You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.	你可以筛选这些数据看看人们都提交了些什么。
This is in response to, What's beautiful?	这个是对什么东西美丽？
"Miss World."	的回答：世界小姐。
There are two modes to the time capsule.	时间胶囊有两种模式。
There's One World, which presents the spinning globe, and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one.	一个模式叫整个世界，表示成这个旋转的球， 另一个模式叫大众声音，把数据分割显示成电影胶片一样， 你可以一个一个地筛选。
So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event, which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights, the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls, which stand about 200 feet tall.	有一个非常令人叹为观止的活动最好地展示了这个项目， 在新墨西哥州阿尔伯克基市外围的沙漠中的 杰梅斯普布洛，连续3个晚上， 时间胶囊的内容被投射到 红岩峡谷的古城墙上， 大概60米高。
It was really incredible.	那真是难以言表的壮观。
And we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.	我们也把时间胶囊的内容转换成 二进制代码，用35瓦的激光射入太空。
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there.	你可以看到这些橙色的光线 以大概45度角从沙漠地面发射出去。
This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier -- the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.	这真是漂亮， 因为第一个晚上，我看着这所有的信息， 才真正开始看到了前面说的差异—— 年龄，性别，财富等等的差异。
But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more, and saw these images go across the rocks, I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again.	但是，你知道吗，当我对着这个东西看了又看， 看着这些图片在岩石上滚动， 我意识到看到的是一遍又一遍的 同样的很典型的事情。
You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss, the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.	比如：婚礼，生小孩，送葬，第一辆汽车，初吻， 第一头骆驼或者马——取决于各自的文化。
And it was really moving.	那真是感人。
And this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away, where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.	这张照片是 从大约两英里远的一个悬崖上在最后一个晚上拍的， 用激光把胶囊的内容射向太空。
And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.	这把所有的人类情绪发射到夜空的感觉 真的是令人激动不已。
And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky, and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories.	它使我开始经常思考夜空， 思考人类一直以来怎样用夜空 来演绎他们让人惊叹的故事。
You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up, I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.	我是在一个佛蒙特州的农场长大的， 小时候我常常仰望夜空， 看着猎户座腰带的三颗星星。
And as an adult, I've been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.	成年之后，我对那些希腊神话描述的 天空中每天晚上发生的故事有了更多了解。
You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.	你们知道吗，猎户座在咆哮的公牛座对面，
Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.	珀耳修斯座飞去救援仙女座，
Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.	宙斯与柯罗诺斯争夺对奥林匹斯山的控制。
I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.	这些都是希腊人的美好的神话。
And it caused me to wonder about our world today.	它使我思考我们今天的世界，
And it caused me to wonder specifically, if we could make new constellations today, what would those look like?	特别是如果我们今天 能做出新的星座， 会是什么样子？
What would those be?	会是些什么东西？
If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?	如果我们可以在天空中画新的图片，我们会画什么？
What are the great stories of today?	现在有些什么好故事？
And those are the questions that inspired my new project, which is debuting here today at TED.	这些问题启发了我的新项目， 今天在TED这里首次亮相，
Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.	至今为止还没有人在公共场合看见过。
It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.	这个项目名字叫作宇宙，目的是展示我们现时代的神话，
And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.	它模拟了一个能互动的夜空。
So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.	非常高兴现在可以演示给大家看。
So, Universe will open here.	这是宇宙的初始画面，
And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field, and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background, kind of morphing with color.	你可以看到它有一个移动的星盘， 以极光为背景， 颜色变幻。
The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom, and we'll put it down here to red.	北极光的颜色 可以由底部这个色彩控制条调整， 我们现在把它定为红色。
So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.	然后你看到这些星星在移动。
Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.	其实，这些星星不只是一些小亮点，小像素。
Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was stated by somebody, an image, a news story, a person, a company. You know, some kind of heroic personality.	每个星星实际上是 现实世界中的一个具体事件—— 比如某人写的一段话，一个图像， 一个新闻故事，一个人，一个公司，对吧， 有点个人英雄主义的感觉。
And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.	你可能注意到当鼠标 触及到一些星星的时候，会隐隐约约显示出一些形状。
We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.	我们这里看到一个男人在走路，也可能是女人。
And we see here a photograph with a head.	在这里看到，一张有一个脑袋的照片。
You can start to see words emerging here.	你开始看到文字在这里浮现。
And those are the constellations of today.	所有这些都是星座， 都是现代的星座。

This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.	这是2007年最后两个月的宇宙。
The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world.	这里面的数据来自于全球新闻报道的 世界各地数以千计的新闻来源，
It's using the API of a really great company that I work with in New York, actually, called Daylife.	用和我一起合作的一家真的很不错的纽约公司的 应用程序接口，公司名字叫天生。
And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.	它有点像是在过去几个月中 世界发生的现代神话的思潮展示。
So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford, Iraq, Bush.	然后，我们可以看看这里在浮现什么，比如福特总统， 伊拉克，布什。
And we can actually isolate just the words -- I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list.	我们也可以单独把文字提取出来—— 我称之为秘密——然后把它们 按字母顺序排列。
And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently.	我们看到安娜•妮可史密斯 最近有不少内容。
President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.	福特总统——这是吉拉德•福特的葬礼。
We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe, and everything else will enter its orbit.	我们可以在宇宙中点击任何东西， 让它成为宇宙的中心， 其他一切都将进入它的环绕轨道。
So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.	那么，我们点击福特，它就成为中心，
And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it.	所有涉及到福特的星星都进入到它的轨道 围绕它运转。
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.	我们也可以只提取照片，就像现在看到的。
We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe.	我们可以点击这些照片， 让它成为宇宙的中心。
Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.	现在和它相关的事情环绕在它周围。

It just goes infinitely, and you can just kind of click on stuff.	它是无限的， 你基本上只要点击它就可以了。
This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.	这是一个相片集合，叫作快照。
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.	但是，我们其实可以更具体地定义我们的宇宙。
So, if we want to, let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.	比如，如果我们想 看看比尔•克林顿的宇宙是什么模样。
And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.	让我们看看在上个礼拜他干了些什么。
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton.	那么，现在我们有了一个新的宇宙， 仅限于所有与比尔•克林顿有关的事情。
We can have his constellations emerge here.	我们可以把他的星座显示在这里，
We can pull out his secrets, and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates, Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.	提取出他的秘密， 可以发现大部分和总统候选人 希拉里和奥巴马有关。
We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.	我们可以看到目前克林顿正在参与的 那些报道，
Any of those can be opened up.	所有这些都可以打开。
So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.	这样，我们看到奥巴马和克林顿夫妇在阿拉巴马州会面。
You can see that this is an important story; there are a lot of things in its orbit.	你知道这是一个重要的事件， 会有很多东西在其轨道上。
If we open this up, we get different perspectives on this story.	如果我们打开这个， 我们就能看到这个故事的方方面面的信息。
You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source.	你可以点击任何这些东西，链接到这些信息的源头 去看原文。
This one's from Al Jazeera.	这个是从半岛电视台来的。
We can also see the superstars. These would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of Bill Clinton.	我们还可以看到超级巨星，它们是比尔•克林顿的宇宙中 潜藏着的男女角色（注：就像希腊神话英雄）。
So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary, Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby -- these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.	 那里有克林顿，希拉里， 伊拉克，乔治•布什，奥巴马，滑板车•利比（美国前副总统办公室主任） ——他们可以说成是比尔•克林顿的人际脉络。

And there are also quotes that you can see, if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.	如果你对阅读有关气候变化的文章 有兴趣，这里你还可以看到文章摘录。
You know, this is really an infinite thing.	这确实是一个没有止境的东西，对吧。
The superstars of climate change in 2006: United States, Britain, China.	2006年气候变化的超级巨星有： 美国，英国，中国。
You know, these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.	很明显， 这些都是界定这个概念的最重要的国家。
So this is a piece that demands exploration.	所以说，这个项目很有继续探索的潜力。
This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.	这个项目将在几天之后在网上公开，有可能是下周二。
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be.	你们都可以用它来探索一下 你个人的神话世界是什么样子。
You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe -- it supports both the notion of a global mythology, which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007, and also a personal mythology.	你会发现在天生系统，或者更准确地说，在宇宙， 它不仅支持一个全球神话的概念， 比如泛泛的说2007年的宇宙， 也支持个人神话的概念。

So it's been a pleasure.	很高兴和大家分享。非常感谢。
Thank you very much.	再次谢谢。
I'm here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.	今天我来这里号召大家 一起来重构人类及其他生物做事的方式。
Here is the old story -- we've already heard a little bit about it: biology is war in which only the fiercest survive; businesses and nations succeed only by defeating, destroying and dominating competition; politics is about your side winning at all costs.	这里先说说过去的老方式。 生物学是一场战争，只有最凶猛的生物可以生存。 生意场上、国家之间，只有击败、 摧毁对方，占据主导地位才能成功。 政治就是不计代价为自己一方赢得胜利。
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.	但我觉得我们看得到，一个新故事也渐渐开始上演。
It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines, in which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role.	这是个横跨很多不同领域的故事， 在这中间合作开放、协作行为及复杂的相互依存关系， 扮演着更加重要的角色。
And the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room.	它的中心部分，不再是完全由绝对重要的竞争和适者生存占据 它萎缩了一些，留出了一部分空间。
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs," and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.	当我开始写《聪明行动族》这本书时， 我开始思考沟通、媒体和集体行为三者间的关系。 我发现在写完书之后，我还是忍不住不停地去想。
In fact, if you look back, human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.	事实上，当你回顾过去，人类沟通媒体 及我们的社会组织方式，都是共同演进了相当长一段时间的。
Humans have lived for much, much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups.	人类活在地球上的时间， 比起约一万年的定居农业文明要长得多。
Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food.	 以小家庭为组织的游牧猎人，射杀兔子，采集食物。
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.	当时财富的形式是有足够的食物可以生存。
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.	但在某个阶段这些家庭组织在一起，去捕捉更大的猎物。
And we don't know exactly how they did this, although they must have solved some collective action problems; it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups.	我们不确定他们当时是如何做到的。 不过他们一定解决了某些集体行动上的问题。 当你猎杀乳齿象时， 不能和其他组织争斗，这样才说的通。
And again, we have no way of knowing, but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.	不过，我们也无从得知， 但很显然，当时一定有某种新的财富模式产生了。
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.	猎人家庭拥有了更多的蛋白质，等不到吃完就腐烂掉了。
So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms.	这样就产生了一个社会问题， 而我相信这个问题推动了新的社会模式的产生。
Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families?	那些吃乳齿象肉的人是否欠了 猎人和他们的家庭某些东西呢？
And if so, how did they make arrangements?	如果是这样，他们又是如何达成协议的呢？
Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved.	同样的，我们无法得知，但我们可以确信， 其中一定包含某种象征性的沟通。
Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations, the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.	当然，随着农业的发展，人类第一次迈向文明 出现了第一批泥土和砖块盖起来的城市以及第一个帝国。
And it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks; marks on clay in that time.	正是这些帝国的掌权人， 开始雇佣人力，来记录别人欠下的麦子、羊以及葡萄酒。 还有他人欠的税款等。 当时他们通过在粘土上做记号来记录这些。
Not too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.	在那之后不久，人们就发明了字母表。
And this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years, for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empires.	这个强有力的工具从此被保存了好几千年， 专门给那些帮帝国记账的精英管理者所使用。
And then another communication technology enabled new media: the printing press came along, and within decades, millions of people became literate.	然后，另一个新的沟通科技创造了新的媒体。 印刷厂出现了，在几十年内， 就有数以百万计的人懂得了读写。
And from literate populations, new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge, religion and politics.	而这些会读书写字的人们， 在知识、宗教、政治的领域里， 开创了新的集体行动的模式。
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation, constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.	我们看见了科学革命，新教改革， 以及宪政民主等这些以前不可能的事物成为了可能。
Not created by the printing press, but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.	这些不是由印刷媒体创造的， 而是文化所带动的集体行动中造就的。
And again, new forms of wealth emerged.	此外，各种新的财富模式也兴起了。
Now, commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads.	现如今开来，经济是古老的，市场跟十字路口一样老。
But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old, enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies, such as the joint-stock ownership company, shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.	但就如我们所知，资本主义只有短短几百年而已， 它因合作和科技而得以实现， 例如合资股份公司， 共有责任保险及复式记账等。
Now of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet, and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press, a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.	当然，现在的科技都以网络为基础。 在多对多沟通的时代，每个桌面电脑现在都成了印刷厂、 广播电台、社区或者市场。
Evolution is speeding up.	革命还在加速进行。
More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops, and very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of the human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today.	近来，这种革命已经不再围绕台式机打转转了。 很快，我们将会看到一个占显著比例的一部分人，即使不是大多数， 将会拿着、揣着或戴着超级电脑走来走去， 这些电脑互相连接，而其连接速度 会比我们今天所知道的宽频还要快的多。
Now, when I started looking into collective action, the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."	当我开始研究集体行动时， 那可观的相关文献是基于被社会学家称为社会困境之上的。
And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.	关于社会困境有些虚构的描述。
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them: the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.	我将简要地说明其中两项， 即囚犯困境以及共有财产的悲哀。
Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly, he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma, so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.	当我跟凯文·凯利聊起这些事时， 他向我保证在座的每位大概都知道 囚犯困境是怎么回事。 所以，我将很快速地重复一下。
If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later.	如果你有更多的疑问，可以去问凯文·凯利，不过要等下。
The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war: two players who couldn't trust each other.	囚犯困境实际上是一个 叠加在数学矩阵之上的故事， 这个故事来源于早期对于核战争思考的游戏理论： 两个玩家无法信任彼此。
Let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.	我们可以说，每个无担保的交易， 都是囚犯困境的好例子。
Person with the goods, person with the money, because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.	有商品的人和有钱的人， 因为无法信任彼此而无法进行交易。
Neither one wants to be the first one or they're going to get the sucker's payoff, but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.	没有人想迈出第一步， 因为这样他们就会吃亏。 当然，他们都会输，因为他们都得不到想要的东西，
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.	只有当他们同意将囚犯困境 变成信任赛局的报酬矩阵时，他们才能进行下一步。
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all?	二十年前，罗伯特阿克塞罗德利用囚犯困境， 进行对生物问题的探索。 如果我们活在此地是因为我们的祖先都是强悍的竞争者， 那么合作又怎么可能存在呢？
He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered, much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.	阿克塞罗德开始了一个电脑竞赛 让人们针对囚犯困境，提交各自策略， 然后他意外的发现，其中最最简单的策略竟然赢了。 这个策略赢了第一场比赛，甚至在大家都知道这件事之后， 还赢了第二场竞赛。这个策略就是以牙还牙。
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.	另一个经济游戏可能不像囚犯困境那样广为人知， 这就是最后通牒游戏 这也是个关于人们 如何进行经济交易的有趣探索。
Here's how the game is played: there are two players; they've never played the game before, they will not play the game again, they don't know each other, and they are, in fact, in separate rooms.	游戏是这样玩的。 有两个玩家， 双方都不没有玩过这游戏， 他们也不会再玩这个游戏。他们知道彼此是谁。 实际上，他们在不同的房间里。
First player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10, whatever that player wants to propose.	给第一个玩家一百美元， 然后要求他做出分配：50/50，90/10。
The second player either accepts the split -- both players are paid and the game is over -- or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over.	第二个玩家可以接受第一个玩家所提出的分配， 然后双方都获得金钱，游戏结束。 第二个玩家也可以拒绝这个分配，双方都拿不到钱，然后游戏结束。
Now, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.	新古典派经济的基础会告诉你， 拒绝任何一美元都是不明智的， 因为某个陌生人在另一个房间里将得到99美元。
Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students, a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.	可是，在成千上万美国、欧洲以及日本学生的测试中， 有显著的比例的人会拒绝任何少于50/50的分配。
And although they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played the game before, proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.	尽管玩家被隔离而且从来不知道这个游戏， 而且从前也从没玩过这个游戏， 提议的人似乎天生就知道这个结果， 因为提议的平均值令人意外的接近50/50。
Now, the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered, to their surprise, that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures -- each had radically different ideas of what is fair.	有趣的部分是最近才知道的， 当人类学者将这些游戏带到其他文化去时， 他们惊讶的发现， 亚马逊的刀耕火种法的农耕民族， 或者是中亚的游牧民族，以及其他许多不同的文化—— 每个人对于公平都有极端不同的看法。
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness, that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions, whether we know that or not.	由此可见，与其说人类天生有对公平的共同观感， 倒不如说我们的经济交易基础 会被我们的社会制度所影响—— 无论我们是否意识到这点。
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.	另一个主要的社会困境就是共有财产的悲哀。
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.	60年代末，加勒特·哈丁利用它来说明人口过剩的问题。
He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.	他例举某个共用畜牧的土地为例，在那里， 每个人只是简单的将他们畜牧的牛羊增加到最大值， 就会导致过度畜牧，资源耗尽。
He had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it.	他得出了令人沮丧的结论， 人类将无可避免的掠夺任何公有的资源， 因为人们无法克制不去使用它们。
Now, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in 1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask, which is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?	奥斯特姆，政治科学家， 在1990年问了一个任何好的科学家都该问的有趣问题， 那就是，人类是否真的总会破坏公共资源呢？
So she went out and looked at what data she could find.	于是她就想看下能找到什么样的数据。
She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds, forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case, humans destroyed the commons that they depended on.	她查看了几千个关于人们共用 水源、森林和渔业的个案，然后果然发现，各个案例都显示 人类真的会破坏他们所依赖的公有资源。
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma; in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.	但是，她也发现，在许多情况下，人们逃出了囚犯困境。 事实上，共有财产的悲哀是一个多数玩家的囚犯困境。
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.	她说，只有当人们觉得自己就是囚犯时，他们才会是囚犯。
They escape by creating institutions for collective action.	人们通过制造集体行动的机制逃离困境。
And she discovered, I think most interestingly, that among those institutions that worked, there were a number of common design principles, and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work.	我觉得最有趣的， 是她发现在所有可行的机制当中， 有几个通用的设计原则， 而这些原则看起来 在不可行的机制中是没有的。
I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines.	我将快速的谈谈几个领域。
In biology, the notions of symbiosis, group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.	 在生物学中，共生的概念，群组选择， 以及演化心理学颇都是非常具有争议性的。
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.	但是，关于生物学中 合作机制已经日渐重要这个事实，再不会有任何大的辩论， 从细胞到整个生态系统都是如此。
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned.	此外，这也颠覆了我们视个人为经济体 的概念。
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.	理性的个人利益，并不总是占优势的因素。
In fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.	实际上，人们会为了惩罚欺骗者而做出行动，哪怕会输掉他们自己的利益。
And most recently, neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain.	最近，神经生物学的测量显示 在经济游戏中惩罚欺骗者的人 脑部的酬劳中枢处于活跃状态。
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together.	这项发现让某位科学家宣称，利他的惩罚 也许是使社会连接在一起的粘合剂。
Now, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms.	我一直说新的沟通模式和新的媒体 在过去如何帮助塑造新的经济模式。
Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old.	商业是古老的，市场是历史悠久的，资本主义是近代的。
Capitalism is fairly recent; socialism emerged as a reaction to that.	 而社会主义的崛起，则是对资本主义的回应。
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.	但我们很少看到有人讲到下个模式将如何崛起。
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source, pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.	詹姆斯·索诺维尔基简要的提到了约柴·本科勒教授关于开放源代码的论文， 论文中提出了一种新的生产模式——点对点的生产。
I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth, we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones.	我只想要你们记住，如果在过去是新的科技促进了新的合作模式， 继而制造出新的财富形式， 我们也许正向另一个新的经济模式演进， 它与过去的模式相比有着显著的不同。
Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun -- some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.	让我们很简要的看看几个企业，你们知道IBM、惠普以及SUN。
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace, treats them as a network and trains them to produce better, even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.	丰田不再象对待市场一样对待供应商， 而是视他们为网络的一环并训练加强他们生产力， 尽管丰田知道这样一来竞争者也将因此获得更好的产品。
Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism; they're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.	这些公司都不是为了利他主义而行动的。 他们做这些事都是因为 了解到在自我利益中含有某种程度的分享。
Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.	开放自由软件的生产让我们看到世界级的软件，像Linux以及Mozilla， 但这些软件不能从公司的官僚结构中生产， 也无法从我们所知的市场诱因中产出。

Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.	亚马逊开放了自己的应用程序接口 给6万名开发者以及无数的亚马逊商店。
They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.	他们并不是出于利他主义而去做好事，而是当作一种充实自己的手段。
eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.	Ebay解决了囚犯困境， 创造了前所未有的市场。他们创造了一个回馈机制， 将囚犯困境变成了合作博弈。
Instead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves," it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."	原来是我们彼此间不信任，所以我们不得不退而求其次， 现在是你必须先证明自己是可信任的，然后我才愿意合作。
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.	维基百科利用上万名志愿者来创造一个免费的百科全书， 在短短两年内就以200种语言完成了150万篇文章。
We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world, including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now: it's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it, illiterates can be trained to use it.	我们看到ThinkCycle让发展中国家的非政府组织 提出问题，由世界各地设计学科的学生来帮忙解决。 这包括现在海啸救援中所使用的东西。 这是用来为霍乱病患者 补充水分的简单装置，非常容易用，即使是不识字的人 也可以通过培训很快掌握使用。
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader, making the system more efficient the more it is used.	BitTorrent将每个下载者变成上传者， 这让系统变得使用越多就越有效率。
Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the Internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that's Folding@home at Stanford -- to crack codes, to search for life in outer space.	千百万人自愿贡献出他们的桌面电脑， 在自己不使用的时候，一起连接到网络 变成超级电脑集体的一份子。 比如用来协助医学研究员解决蛋白质褶皱的问题， 这是在丹佛大学的Folding@Home。或是在外太空寻找生命迹象。
I don't think we know enough yet.	我认为我们知道的还远远不够。
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are, but I think we can begin to think about them.	我们甚至连最基本的原理是什么都还没有搞清楚。 但是我觉得我们可以开始思考这些问题。
And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them, but think about self-interest.	而我没有足够的时间可以讲述所有东西。 但是想想利己主义吧。
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.	这全是自我利益最大化的例子。
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.	在萨尔外多的内战中，撤退的两方 所采取的行动，验证了囚犯困境的脱困策略。
In the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world, citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.	在美国，菲律宾，肯尼亚以及世界各地， 公民利用手机和短信 自己组织政治游行以及投票活动。
Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?	一个类似阿波罗登月计划的合作是否可能呢？
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?	跨学科的研究合作是否可能呢？
I believe that the payoff would be very big.	我相信合作带来的活力会非常大。
I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines.	我想我们需要开始为这新领地绘制地图， 这样我们可以跨领域进行讨论。
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people -- and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things -- but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago, people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.	我并不是说了解了合作 会使我们变成更好的人。 有时候人们会一起合作做坏事。 但是你要知道，在几百年前， 人们看见自己亲爱的人死于疾病时， 认为那是由罪恶、外国人或者恶魔造成的。
Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.	笛卡尔说我们应该有一个全新的思考方式。
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease, suffering was alleviated.	当科学带来了那个新的思考方式， 当生物学查出微生物是造成疾病的原因， 病人的痛苦减轻了。
What forms of suffering could be alleviated, what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation?	什么样的痛苦可以得到减缓呢？ 如果我们对合作了解的更多， 什么样的财富可以被创造呢？
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen; it's going to require effort.	我不认为这跨学科的对话 将会自动发生。
Good afternoon.	下午好。
I am proud to be here at TEDxKrakow.	能来到TEDxKrakow（克拉科夫，波兰城市）我非常骄傲。
I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and is actually changing the world, and whose name is people power.	今天我要说一说 一个有能力并且正在改变世界的现象， 这个现象就是人民的力量。

Well, first one, analytic skills.	第一，分析能力。
I'll try where it all started in the Middle East, and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the Middle East.	请让我从这一切的源头中东地区说起 多年来，我们对中东地区的印象 一直有失偏颇。
It was looking like the frozen region, literally a refrigerator, and there are only two types of meals there: steak, which stands for a Mubarak, Ben Ali-type of military police dictatorship, or a potato, which stands for Tehran types of theocracies.	我们认为中东好像一个被冷冻的区域，一个冰箱 而且里面只有两种食物： 一种是牛排，代表穆巴拉克、本·阿里这种 军事独裁统治，另外一种是土豆， 也就是以伊朗德黑兰政权为代表的神权政体。
And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions of young, mainly secular people step out to do the change.	因此当冰箱打开，成千上万的年轻人， 其中大部分拥有着平凡的价值观，走上街头呼吁变革的时候 很多人非常惊讶。

And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe?	再看看欧洲街头示威人群的年龄组成？
It seems that Generation Epsilon is coming.	年轻一代正在走上政治舞台。
Now let me set another example.	现在请允许我再举一个例子。
I'm meeting different people throughout the world, and they are, you know, academics and professors and doctors, and they will always talk conditions.	我与来自世界各地的很多人讨论过这个话题 学者、教授、医生都有 他们都喜欢讲条件。
They will say, "People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive."	他们会说，只有政权对于人民的压迫过于深重的时候，人民的力量才会起作用。

Let me give you the example.	请允许我再举一个例子。
I am coming from a country called Serbia.	我来自塞尔维亚。
It took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders, with their big egos, behind one single candidate against Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic.	我们花了10年的时间才联合18个自恃甚高的反对党领袖 选出一个候选人 对抗巴尔干独裁者斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇。

So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place, shouting and showing off in front of the security forces.	除了聚集在一起， 在安保人员面前大叫示威之外， 还有很多其他的斗争方式。
Now there is also another very important dynamic, and this is a dynamic normally analytics don't see.	事实上还有一种动态制衡也非常重要 而且常被分析家忽略。

So, I mean, these are the things you can do, and you can always use the humor.	因此，我们都可以做一些力所能及的事， 而且别忘记将幽默融入其中。

Don't mix tools with the substance.	不要混淆工具和实质。
It is true that the Internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper.	在提高效率和降低成本方面 网络和新媒体非常有效。
They make it also a bit safer for the participants because they give the part of anonymity.	网络的匿名性则 提高了参加反抗运动的安全性。

Well, million dollar question: What will happen in the Arab World?	再说一个重要的问题：阿拉伯世界今后会如何发展？
And though young people from the Arab World were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators, shaking the region, kind of persuading clever kings from Jordan and Morocco doing substantial reforms, it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome, whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflict, whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline, faced with the brutal daily violence which kills thousands already, or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war.	阿拉伯世界的年轻人 成功的扳倒了三个独裁者， 振荡了整个世界的格局，一定程度上说服了 约旦和摩洛哥聪明的国王大举改革， 但最终的结果还尚未揭晓， 埃及和突尼斯能否成功过渡 会不会有血腥的种族或者宗教冲突爆发 面对日渐残暴、已经造成上千人死亡 的暴力镇压，叙利亚人民 能否坚持不动用武力 还是说他们会陷入武装斗争 引起一场惨烈的内战。
Will these revolutions be whole like through the transitions to democracy or be overtaken by military or extremists of all kinds?	这些革命是否能引领国家向民主过渡 它们的胜利果实会不会被军方 或者各种极端分子攫取？
We cannot tell.	我们无法预测。
Same works for the Western sector, where you can see all of these excited young people protesting around the world, occupying this, occupying that.	发生在西方社会的抗议也是如此 有很多激愤的年轻人四处抗议 一会儿占领这个，一会儿占领那个。
Are they going to become the world wave?	他们会引领世界的潮流吗？

This is the difference between two towns.	这两者有云泥之别。
Now, what [do] the statistics have?	数据显示出什么样的发展趋势呢？
My friend's book, Maria Stephan's book, talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle, and there are some shocking data.	我的朋友Maria Stephan的书 探讨了与暴力和非暴力斗争有关的大量问题 也包含着一些惊人的数据。
If you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy, you will see that out of 67 different cases, in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power.	过去35年中 在不同的国家一共发生了67次 从独裁到民主的社会变革 其中有50次是通过非暴力斗争实现的 因此，非暴力斗争能起到非常关键的作用。
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon.	从这个角度来看，当今世界正在发生的事情值得关注。
This is one more reason to look at the Generation Epsilon, enough for me to give them credit and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use the nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world.	从这个角度来看，年轻一代值得关注， 我相信他们有希望 用自己的能力和勇气 通过非暴力斗争 解决一部分 我们这代人给世界带来的问题。

There is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister, going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.	话说80年代的时候，瑞典前首相奥洛夫·帕尔梅 曾想去美国拜访罗纳德·里根。
Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said -- and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister -- "Isn't this man a communist?"	虽然说他当时是瑞典的社会民主党首相， 不过在他到访之前，里根还是问道： 这个人是共产主义者吗？

We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society.	我们现在拥有了 通过互联网和各种现代通信手段 来结识无法在现实生活中见面的 志同道合的人士。 我们现在拥有了 集体组织、联合行动 共同解决问题、 处理不公正行为的能力。 正因为如此，我坚信我们正处在一个 独特的历史时刻， 开创着一个真正全球化的社会。
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.	200年前，贩奴贸易面临着 来自威廉·威伯福斯和反对者的压力。

But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.	但整场运动却是花费了24年的时间才取得最终的胜利。
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people's hearts and minds?	设想一下，如果当初他们拥有现代的通讯技术 来传播照片、赢取民心， 他们又将取得怎样的成就呢？
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb, the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.	再来看看埃格兰泰恩·杰布女士， 90年前她创建了救助儿童会。
She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria, that in Britain she wanted to take action, but she had to go house to house, leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children, an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.	一战后的奥地利 和战败家庭中儿童的悲惨经历 深深地惊骇了她， 让她决定在英国行动起来。 但她不得不挨家挨户散发传单， 促使群众参加 在皇家艾伯特大厅举行的集会， 救助儿童会也因此而诞生， 并成为我们国家，乃至整个世界 最伟大的国际组织之一。
But what more could she have done if she'd had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately?	但设想一下， 如果她当初拥有现代的通讯技术， 让人们意识到他们所目睹的不公行径急需解决的话， 她所能做的恐怕不仅仅是这些吧？
Now look at what's happened in the last 10 years.	让我们再来看看过去十年所发生的事情。

Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.	还有一年前的津巴布韦，在总统罗伯特·穆加贝统治下的首次大选。
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.	正是因为人们可以利用手机拍照， 来记录在投票站所发生的一切， 才使得穆加贝无法按计划地对选举结果进行暗箱操作。
Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out, a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs told the world that there was a repression, meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi, who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world, had to be listened to.	还有缅甸和那些通过博客与外界交流的僧侣们。 人们之前对这个国家一无所知， 直到这些博客揭露了发生在那里的镇压， 遇难的生命， 遭迫害的群众， 才使得昂山素季，全世界最伟大的政治囚犯之一， 终于有了倾诉的权利。
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today: following what happened to Neda, people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging, changing their address to Tehran, Iran, and making it difficult for the security services.	再来看看伊朗， 还有人们在妮达遇难后所做的一切。 国家安全保卫部门的人士发现 那些通过博客与外界交流的伊朗人 把他们的地址通通改成了伊朗德黑兰， 让安全部的官员难以追查。

That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world.	这一切，在我看来，给了我们第一次以一个共同体的身份 从根本上改变我们这个世界的机会。
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites; it's got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging, who are communicating with each other around the world.	外交政策将彻底改变，无法由掌权人士一手管控， 而应是遵循那些博客们， 那些在世界范围内与彼此交流的人所代表的民意。
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.	200年前，我们需要解决的问题是奴隶制度。
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people, children, had the right to education.	150年前，我猜想像我们这样的国家所面临的主要问题 是年轻人、孩子们的受教育权利。

50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.	50年前这股压力则是转向了社会保障福利权。
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid, discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.	在过往的五六十年里，我们目睹了法西斯主义、反犹太主义、种族歧视、种族隔离 以及种种对性别和性取向的歧视。
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation.	我们当时正出席一个庆祝曼德拉生日 和他的基金会求得新资源的演唱会。
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so -- when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage.	我当时就坐在曼德拉的身边——我对此感到非常荣幸。 当看到艾米·怀恩豪斯登上舞台的时候，
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.	曼德拉显得有点吃惊， 我只好向他解释艾米·怀恩豪斯是何许人物。
Amy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.	艾米·怀恩豪斯在舞台上说道：曼德拉和我有很多共同之处。
My husband too has spent a long time in prison."	我老公也曾在监狱里蹲了很长一段时间。
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all.	随后曼德拉走向舞台， 概述了我们所面临的挑战。
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.	他说，在他的有生之年里，他攀越了一座无比陡峻的高山， 一座迎战并且击败种族压迫、隔离的大山。
He said that there was a greater challenge ahead, the challenge of poverty, of climate change -- global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society.	他认为前方还有着更艰巨的挑战等待着我们， 贫困的挑战，气候的挑战，种种全球性的挑战 急需着全球性的解决方案， 急需着一个真正的全球性的社会。
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this.	而我们这一代是有实力做到这一切的第一代。
Combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face, most of which are global in their nature.	将一个全球性的道德理念 与我们的传播能力相结合， 再在国际的范围内组织起来， 共同来面对这些全球性的挑战。
Climate change cannot be solved in one country, but has got to be solved by the world working together.	气候变化无法由一个国家来解决， 而是需要全世界同心协力彼此合作。
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone; it needed the world to work together.	金融危机，就如我们目睹的一样， 无法单单依靠美国或是欧洲来得以解决， 而是需要世界范围内的合作。
Take the problems of security and terrorism and, equally, the problem of human rights and development: they cannot be solved by Africa alone; they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.	或者是来看看国家安全与恐怖主义的问题， 抑或是同等重要的人权与发展的问题， 这些问题都无法由非洲独立解决， 也不能单独依靠美国或是欧洲。
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together.	除非我们合作起来，这些问题是没有办法解决的。
So the great project of our generation, it seems to me, is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together, a truly global society, built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future.	所以在我看来，我们这一代最重要的工程 就是有史以来第一次通过全球性的道德观、 全球性的沟通和组织能力， 来建立起一个全球性的社会， 以此道德规范为基础，但同时依赖于 为全球性社会服务的种种机构，来开创一个不一样的未来。
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.	我们是有能力做到这一切的第一代。
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem, where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that, when we want to create a global carbon market, but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem?	就拿气候变化来说吧， 我们知道我们正面临着这样的一个局势， 我们知道我们存在着气候变化的问题， 我们也知道我们若是真想创建一个全球性的碳市场， 我们就需要捐赠给贫穷国家更多的资源， 帮助他们来处理这一问题， 但尽管如此，我们仍然没有一个 人们可以信赖认可的全球机构来解决这个问题， 这不是相当滑稽可耻的事情吗？
One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda.	几个月后将在哥本哈根举行的气候会议 所必须达成的协议之一 就是建立一个全球性的环境机构， 并且有能力 来敦促整个世界为了气候变化的进程 而共同行动起来。
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well, so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations.	但仅仅建立这样的一个机构是不够的， 原因之一就在于我们还需要说服世界各地的人们 改变他们的日常行为， 这就需要公平、负责的全球道德观 得以代代相传。
Take the financial crisis.	再来看看当下的金融危机。
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.	如果一个从纽约开始、从美国次代市场开始的危机 可以影响到贫穷国家的人们的话，
If people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland or the rest in Britain, and people's ordinary savings are affected by it, then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.	如果次代产品可以经过多次转手 跨越国界， 最终流通到冰岛的银行 或是英国其他地区， 并且影响到普通民众的存款储蓄的话， 那么一个国家性的监管机构就是不值得信赖的。
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth, for jobs, as well as for financial stability, global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared, and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.	长期的稳定、经济的增长、 就业的保障以及金融的稳定 都需要全球性的经济体制 来确保稳定的发展得以共享， 并且是建立在世界的繁荣是不可划分 的原则之上。
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility, not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.	所以说，面临我们这一代的另一个挑战，就是建立起 全球性的机构，来反映我们公正、负责的观念， 而不是过往几年金融发展最后阶段 不牢靠的地基。
Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.	再来看看发展，还有我们和世界其他地区， 尤其是那些贫困地区所需要建立的伙伴关系。
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future, and yet, out of people's desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done.	我们暂时还没有一个可以在未来建立起一个合适的伙伴关系的基础， 但只要人们渴求一个全球性的道德观、 渴求一个全球性的社会，一切还是可以办到的。
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.	我刚刚在和塞拉利昂的总统交谈。
This is a country of six and a half million people, but it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses; it has 120 midwives.	那是一个拥有650万人口的国家， 但却只有80个医生，200个护士， 120个助产士。
You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources.	如此短缺的资源是根本无法建立起一个 可以服务600万人民的医疗体系的。
Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania, a girl called Miriam.	再来看看我在坦桑尼亚遇到的 一个叫米丽亚姆的女孩。
She was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS, her mother and then her father.	她当时11岁，她的母亲和父亲 一前一后都死于艾滋病。
She was an AIDS orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for.	她是一名艾滋孤儿，寄人篱下， 从一个亲戚家传到另一个亲戚家。
She herself was suffering from HIV; she was suffering from tuberculosis.	她自己本身也是名艾滋病病毒感染者。 她同时还患有肺结核。
I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.	我是在一个田地里遇到的她。她当是赤着脚，而且衣衫褴褛。
When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future, but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl's eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment, I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.	一般的11岁女孩眼中都充满了对未来的向往， 但是当你注视她的双眼时， 你看到的却是难以触摸到的悲伤。 如果我能把当时的感受传递到世界其他的角落， 我相信那股悲伤将会打动很多人 来为全球的艾滋基金捐款捐力。
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture, so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.	因此，我们必须在富裕国家和贫困国家之间 建立起一个恰达的关系， 建立在我们的渴望之上，那就是，这些贫困国家 可以充分利用他们农业上所需的投资来做到自给自足。 这样一来，非洲将不在是一个食物进口者，而是一个食物出口者。
Take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world.	再来看看人权问题 还有世界众多国家所面临的安全问题。
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy, in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent.	缅甸正被锁链捆绑，津巴布韦是个人间悲剧， 在苏丹，成千上万的人正在本可避免的战争中 无辜地死去。
In the Rwanda Children's Museum, there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.	在卢旺达的儿童博物馆里 有一张一名十岁男童的照片。 这个儿童博物馆现在正在纪念那些 在卢旺达种族屠杀中所死去的上百万人的生命。
There is a photograph of a boy called David.	照片中的小男孩叫做大卫。
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life.	而照片旁边则是大卫的生平简介。
It said "David, age 10."	上面写到：大卫，十岁。
David: ambition to be a doctor.	梦想：成为一名医生。
Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?	最爱的运动：足球。
Making people laugh.	最喜欢做的事：引人发笑。

Tortured to death.	折磨致死。
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death: "Don't worry.	对他同样被折磨致死的母亲所说的最后一句话： 别担心，联合国的人就要来了。
The United Nations are coming."	
And we never did.	可是我们没有。
And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda, and we never did.	那个小男孩坚信我们的承诺， 相信我们会帮助那些在卢旺达的受难人民， 但我们却没有。
So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.	因此我们必须在这个世界建立起 用以维和以及人道救援的机构， 还有帮助那些危难中的国家 重建和安全的机构。
So my argument today is basically this.	所以我今天所要讲的基本上可以总结为如下的几点。
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society.	我们有能力、有办法来创造一个真正的全球化的社会。
The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.	而这个全球化社会的种种机构则需要我们的努力来建立。
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work, but we should not lose the chance in this generation, in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America, with other people working with us around the world, to create global institutions for the environment, and for finance, and for security and for development, that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples, our desire to bind the world together, and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.	全球性的道德观可以为这些机构注入公正、负责的理念， 使其起到应有的作用， 但同时我们也不应错失我们这一代的机会， 尤其是当下的十年里，协同美国的奥巴马总统， 还有来自全球与我们同心协力的人民， 来创建保卫环境、 金融、 安全与发展的全球机构。 这些机构理应明白我们对他人的责任感， 我们想把这个世界联系起来的渴望感， 还有我们想要解决已知问题的需求感。
It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences, people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."	据说在古罗马，当西塞罗演讲的时候， 人们会转向彼此，谈论西塞罗，讲得真好。
But it is said that in Ancient Greece when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences, people turned to each other and didn't say "Great speech."	但是在古希腊， 当狄摩西尼演讲的时候， 人们也会转向彼此，但他们不会说：讲得真好。
They said, "Let's march."	他们会说，让我们行动起来吧。

And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations.	10%的视力受损者 有视觉幻觉
You don't have to be completely blind, only sufficiently impaired.	不一定要完全失明 或完全听不到，才会有这种幻觉
Now with the original description in the 18th century, Charles Bonnet did not have them.	18世纪的查尔斯·邦纳 其实并没有这种症状
His grandfather had these hallucinations.	产生幻觉的是他的祖父
His grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.	一位年长的长官
He'd had cataract surgery.	这个长官曾接受过白内障手术
His vision was pretty poor.	视力不大好
And in 1759, he described to his grandson various things he was seeing.	1759年，他向孙子描述了 他看到的各种各样的幻象
The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair.	第一个幻象 是一块悬浮在空中的手帕
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles.	大大的，蓝色的 还有四个橙色的圆圈
And he knew it was a hallucination.	他知道这是个幻觉
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.	因为手帕不会浮在半空
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.	他还看到过一个大轮子浮在空中
But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not, because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions.	不过有时候他也搞不清楚看到的到底是不是幻觉 因为这些幻觉 会融合在现实的背景里
So on one occasion, when his granddaughters were visiting them, he said, "And who are these handsome young men with you?"	有一次，当他的孙女们来探望他时，他又看到了幻觉 他问：这几个跟你们在一起的帅小伙子是谁啊？
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men."	孙女们却说：诶，爷爷，没有你说的帅小伙啊。
And then the handsome young men disappeared.	突然间帅小伙们就消失了
It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.	这是一种典型的幻觉 刷一下来，刷一下去
They don't usually fade in and out.	没有渐变
They are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.	相当突然，变得也快
Charles Lullin, the grandfather, saw hundreds of different figures, different landscapes of all sorts.	查尔斯·鲁林，也就是那个祖父 看到过几百个不同的人像 还有各种各样的景色
On one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe, and realized it was himself.	有一次，他看到一个穿浴袍的男人在抽烟斗 然后意识到，那就是他自己
That was the only figure he recognized.	那是唯一一个他辨认出来的人像
On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris, he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.	还有一次，他在巴黎的街道上 当真看到了一个脚手架
But when he got back home, he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high, on his study table.	回到家后，却看到了那个脚手架的迷你版 六英尺高，就立在他的书桌上
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia.	这种感知的重复 有时会被称作视像保留
With him and with Rosalie, what seems to be going on -- and Rosalie said, "What's going on?"	这种在查尔斯·鲁林和罗斯莉 身上发生的 让罗斯莉问道我这是这么了？
-- and I said that as you lose vision, as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input, they become hyperactive and excitable, and they start to fire spontaneously.	的现象 我这么解释吧：随着视力的减退 大脑与视力相关的部分渐渐失去了信息输入 从而进入一种过度活跃的、待激活的状态 于是它开始自发地活动
And you start to see things.	让人产生幻象
The things you see can be very complicated indeed.	产生的幻象可以相当复杂
With another patient of mine, who, also had some vision, the vision she had could be disturbing.	我有一个病人 视力没有完全减退 她看到的幻象比较恼人
On one occasion, she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.	她说有一次她看到 餐馆里有一个穿条纹恤衫的男人
And he turned around. And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts, who started walking towards her.	他转过身 然后就突然分裂成6个同样穿条纹恤衫的人像 开始朝她走来
And then the six figures came together again, like a concertina.	然后六个人就合了起来，就像手风琴一样
Once, when she was driving, or rather, her husband was driving, the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.	有一次她正在开车 应该说，是他丈夫在开 路突然就分裂成了4条 她感觉就像同时在4条路上行驶
She had very mobile hallucinations as well.	她的幻觉充满动感
A lot of them had to do with a car.	往往会牵涉到车
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car.	有时她会看到一个青年男孩 坐在引擎盖上
He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned.	紧抓不放，车转弯时 他便随着车的动作缓缓倾斜
And then when they came to a stop, the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air, and then disappear.	车停下后 男孩便会突然垂直飞到100尺的高空 然后消失
And, above all, she would see cartoons.	尤其引人注意的是，她看到的幻象是卡通的
Now, I don't watch Sesame Street, but she made a point of saying, "Why Kermit?"	我不看芝麻街的 不过她坚持要问我： 为什么是柯密特？
She said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.	她说，青蛙柯密特对我来说一点意义都没有啊。
You know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants.	当时我正在研究弗洛伊德决定因素
Why Kermit?	为什么是柯密特？
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."	青蛙柯密特对我来说一点意义都没有啊。
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.	她并不大关注那部卡通
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed, with very large teeth or very large eyes.	让她非常苦恼的是 这些幻觉持续地出现 而且跟罗斯莉的情况一样，幻觉中的脸往往是扭曲的 要么长着大牙，要么长着大眼
And these frightened her.	这让她感到非常不安
Well, what is going on with these people?	那么，这些病人是怎么了？
As a physician, I have to try and define what's going on, and to reassure people, especially to reassure them that they're not going insane.	作为一个医生，我必须尝试阐释这些现象 来安抚他们 尤其得告诉他们，他们没疯
Something like 10 percent, as I said, of visually impaired people get these.	我前面提到过，视力受损的人 有10%会产生幻觉
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them, because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.	但不超过1%会承认 因为他们担心会被当成疯子之类
And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed.	而如果他们向医生提起这种症状 医生可能会做出错误的诊断
In particular, the notion is that if you see things or hear things, you're going mad, but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different.	而且，大家往往认为 如果你看到或听到幻觉，你就是疯了 其实我们提到的这种幻觉跟精神病幻觉是不一样的
Psychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal, they address you. They accuse you.	精神病的幻觉，不管是视觉的还是听觉的 都对付你，指控你
They seduce you. They humiliate you.	诱惑你，羞辱你
They jeer at you.	嘲弄你
You interact with them.	跟你互动
There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.	而这些 都没有出现在邦纳式的幻觉中
There is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you, or that's how people think about it.	邦纳式幻觉就像一部电影，尽管你在看，电影却没有牵涉到你 反正患者们是这么认为的
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy, and sometimes, if one has this, one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past.	还有一种少有的症状叫颞叶癫痫 有时，如果一个人产生这种症状 他可能会感到自己被带回 到过去的一个时空
You're at a particular road junction.	在某一个路口
You smell chestnuts roasting.	闻到烤栗子的香味
You hear the traffic. All the senses are involved.	听到车来车往，所有的感官都参与着
And you're waiting for your girl.	等待着心上人
And it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.	那可能是1982年的某个周二夜晚
And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations, full of feeling, full of familiarity, located in space and time, coherent, dramatic.	这种颞叶异常导致的幻觉 是多感官的 充满着情绪和熟悉感 发生在特定时空中 情节合乎逻辑而戏剧感十足
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.	邦纳式的不一样
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations, you have all sorts of levels, from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces.	在邦纳式幻觉中 有好几种等级 从几何幻觉 比如老太太看到的粉色和蓝色的方块 到非常复杂的幻觉 比如各种人像，尤其是面容
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces, are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations.	这些面容，有时是扭曲的面容 是唯一一种在这些幻觉中 最常见的幻象
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.	一种第二常见的幻象是卡通
So, what is going on?	那么，究竟为什么会产生幻觉呢？
Fascinatingly, in the last few years, it's been possible to do functional brain imagery, to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating.	很棒的是，近几年 我们能够做出脑功能成像 当我们给正产生幻觉的人做功能性磁共振成像时
And in fact, to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating.	我们的确发现大脑视觉部位 有不同区域被激活 这时被检测者正在经历幻觉
When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations, the primary visual cortex is activated.	如果被检测者有的是简单的几何幻觉 被激活的区域则是初级视觉皮质
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.	这是大脑感知边缘和图案的部分
You don't form images with your primary visual cortex.	而我们光靠这里是无法形成完整影像的
When images are formed, a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe.	影像形成时 一个位于颞叶的较高级视觉皮质 会有一定活动
And in particular, one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus.	尤其是颞叶中 叫做梭状回的一个区域，显著地活跃
And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus, they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces.	调查显示，如果梭状回损伤 患者可能因此无法辨认面容
But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus, they may hallucinate faces, and this is exactly what you find in some of these people.	而当梭状回异常时 患者则可能看到面容的幻象 这正是我们前面提到的几位病人所出现的症状
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented, and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations.	梭状回的前部有一个区域 负责处理有关牙齿和眼睛的影像 而当病人出现扭曲的幻觉时 正是这一部位出现了活动
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons.	还有一个区域 会在病人看到卡通幻象时 出现活动
It's activated when one recognizes cartoons, when one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.	人们观看卡通 画卡通，或看到卡通幻象时，都是这一部位被激活
It's very interesting that that should be specific.	这是一个特别有趣的现象
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes.	大脑还有几个别的部位 相应地跟其他视觉元素的辨别与幻觉有关 比如楼房和风景
Around 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain, but particular cells.	1970年左右，人们发现特化的不是一块区域 而是相应的脑细胞
"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.	脸细胞是1970年左右发现的
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells, which can be very, very specific.	至今，我们已经发现了 数百种与各类视觉元素对应的脑细胞 这种对应关系可以非常琐细、明确
So you may not only have "car" cells, you may have "Aston Martin" cells.	比如说 车细胞 可能还有阿斯顿·马丁细胞
I saw an Aston Martin this morning.	今早我看到一部阿斯顿·马丁
I had to bring it in.	我一直想提提它
And now it's in there somewhere.	现在我的脑子里就有这种阿斯顿·马丁细胞
Now, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex, there are only visual images, or figments or fragments.	那么，这一程度的幻觉，只会由这一整块可以称作下颞叶皮质的区域 形成视觉影像、 幻象，或片段
It's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion.	只有更高程度的幻觉 才会有视觉以外的感官参与 同时牵涉到记忆与情感
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome, you don't go to those higher levels.	在邦纳症候群中 更高程度的幻觉并不会出现
You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images, or figments, or fragmentary figments, all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells.	牵涉到初级视觉皮质的幻觉 有上百上千 甚至更多的图像、 幻象，或残缺幻象 这些都被编译 在特定的脑细胞或脑细胞簇中
Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception, or imagination, and one is not conscious of them.	这些细胞通常 参与形成感知和想象 人们通常是无法意识到这一过程的
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted.	只有当你的视力受损或丧失 这一过程才会被干扰
And instead of getting normal perception, you're getting an anarchic, convulsive stimulation, or release, of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex.	在这种情况下，你的感知不再正常 一种不受控的、 痉挛的释放活动 发生在位于初级视觉皮质的 这些视觉脑细胞中
So, suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car.	这种活动的结果就是，你突然看到一张脸，转瞬看到一辆车
Suddenly this, and suddenly that.	突然这，突然那
The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this, but not terribly successfully.	大脑会尝试控制场面 尝试使这一切符合逻辑 但不会很成功
When these were first described, it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.	这些现象最初被描述时 人们相信，跟梦一样，这种幻觉也能被强行中止
But in fact people say, "I don't recognize the people.	不过实际上患者表示 我认不出来谁是谁。
I can't form any associations."	完全没办法想到任何信息。
"Kermit means nothing to me."	青蛙柯密特对我来说一点意义都没有啊。
You don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams.	把这种现象视作梦的一种是行不通的
Well, I've more or less said what I wanted.	唔，我应该说得差不多了
I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common.	我再概括一下 其实帮纳症候群是个常见现象
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice, for patients, for doctors, for the public.	所以不管是病人，医生还是公众 都有必要认识到这一现象的常见性
Finally, I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable, for giving one some insight as to how the brain works.	最后 我发现帮助别人认识大脑作用的原理 是一件无比有趣而有意义的事情
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago -- he wondered how, thinking these hallucinations, how, as he put it, the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain.	查尔斯·邦纳在250年前 在对这些幻觉现象的观察的促使下，思考了这个问题 心智的戏剧性 是如何产生于大脑运作的呢？
Now, 250 years later, I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done.	250年后的今天 我想我们已经能够开始领悟这个精妙的过程
Thanks very much.	非常感谢
That was superb. Thank you so much.	克里斯·安德森：非常精彩，非常感谢你
You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients.	你说得非常精到 也很能理解你的病人
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?	你自己有没有过这些症状呢？
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.	奥利弗·萨克斯：我挺怕你问这个的
Well, yeah, a lot of them.	嗯，有，很大一部分
And actually I'm a little visually impaired myself.	事实上我自己也有一定的视力受损
I'm blind in one eye, and not terribly good in the other.	我的一只眼睛是看不到的，另一只视力也不大好
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.	我看到过几何幻觉
But they stop there.	不过最多也就这个程度了
And they don't disturb you?	安德森：它们会不会让你感到很不安？
Because you understand what's doing it, it doesn't make you worried?	或者说是不是因为你了解这一现象而没这么担心？
OS: Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus, which I ignore.	萨克斯：耳鸣让我烦心得多 耳鸣我也是听而不闻
They occasionally interest me, and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.	不过偶尔我会对自己的幻觉很感兴趣 我还把它们画在了笔记本里
I've gone and had an fMRI myself, to see how my visual cortex is taking over.	我自己就曾做过功能性磁共振成像 看看我的视觉皮层在造什么反
And when I see all these hexagons and complex things, which I also have, in visual migraine, I wonder whether everyone sees things like this, and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit.	我看到六边形的幻觉 或更复杂的幻觉， 往往伴随着偏头痛 那是我就会想是不是别人也会有这样的幻觉 洞穴壁画和装饰艺术 是不是也取材于这种幻觉
That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk.	安德森：你今天的演讲非常非常精彩
Thank you so much for sharing.	感谢你的分享
OS: Thank you. Thank you.	萨克斯：谢谢，谢谢
I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey -- extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually -- which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis.	我今天和你们分享 一个不同寻常的旅行 - 一个不同寻常的有价值的旅行，事实上 - 我 训练老鼠 去拯救人类的生命 通过探测地雷 和发现肺结核。
As a child, I had two passions.	孩童时，我有两个梦想。
One was a passion for rodents.	第一个梦想是关于啮齿类动物的。
I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels.	我有各种各样的鼠， 老鼠，仓鼠， 沙土鼠，松鼠。
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.	你们能叫上名的鼠，我都喂养过，然后我将它们卖到宠物商店。
I also had a passion for Africa.	我还有一个关于非洲的梦想。
Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity.	在一个多元文化的环境中长大， 我们学校里有非洲的学生， 然后我了解到了他们的故事， 不同的背景， 依赖于引进的技术， 物品，服务， 丰富的多元文化。
Africa was truly fascinating for me.	非洲对我很有吸引力。
I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries.	我成为了工业工程师 - 产品研发的工程师 - 我负责相应的探测技术， 实际上对于发展中国家也是 第一个适用的技术。
I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode.	我开始在工业界工作， 但是我工作不开心 来迎合商品消费为主的 线性市场，以及行销手段 和生产的模式。
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines.	我辞掉了工作专注于实际的现实问题： 地雷。
We're talking '95 now.	我们现在在讨论1995年。
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true.	Diana戴安娜王妃在电视上宣布 地雷对于发展来说成为阻碍， 事实上确实如此。
As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land.	只要地雷在那里， 或者有可能存在地雷， 你就不能到那片土地。
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world.	实际上，全球范围都需要 新的探测器 为了可持续发展的环境， 急需这些探测器的地方 尤其是在发展中国家。
We chose rats.	我们选择了鼠。
Why would you choose rats?	为什么会选择鼠呢？
Because, aren't they vermin?	因为，它们是害虫？
Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures.	但是，事实上鼠是 - 和多数人想的相反 - 鼠是非常友善的生物。
And actually, our product -- what you see here.	而且实际上，我们的产品 - 你们所看到的。
There's a target somewhere here.	这里某个地方有个地雷。
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right.	你看到了一个受过训练的非洲探测者， 和在他前面的鼠 实际上是左右相伴。
There, the animal finds a mine.	鼠在那里发现了地雷。
It scratches on the soil.	它挖土地。
And the animal comes back for a food reward.	然后鼠得到了食品奖励。
Very, very simple.	非常，非常简单。
Very sustainable in this environment.	非常环保。
Here, the animal gets its food reward.	这里鼠得到了食品奖励。
And that's how it works.	这是它的工作方式。
Very, very simple.	非常，非常简单。
Now why would you use rats?	现在为什么使用鼠呢？
Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments.	鼠自从上世纪50年代被使用 在各种各样的实验中。
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species.	鼠在嗅觉方面有更多的基因 相比于 其它哺乳动物。
They're extremely sensitive to smell.	它们对于味道非常敏感。
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it.	进而，它们具备确定这些味道方位的能力 并能够表达出来。
Now how do we communicate with rats?	我们怎么和鼠交流呢？
Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there.	不用语言， 但是我们有一个发声器， 一个标准的动物训练的方法， 就是你看到的。
A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.	一个发生器，发出特殊的声音 可以强化某类特定行为。
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.	首先，我们将声音与食品奖励联系起来， 奖励品是碎香蕉和花生做成的液体。
Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat.	一旦鼠听到了声音，就有食物吃， 声音，食物，声音，食物 - 所以一旦有声音就是食物的反应 - 我们把鼠带到有个洞的笼子里， 然后实际上鼠学会 将鼻子放到洞口 下面带有目标气味的洞口， 它们停留5秒钟 - 5秒钟，对鼠来说很长。
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.	一旦鼠知道了这个，我们让任务变得难一些。
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.	它学习如何找到目标气味 在带有一些洞的笼子里，共有10个洞。
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets.	然后鼠学会 拴着皮带在空地上走 并发现目标。
In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields.	在下一步,鼠学会 在地雷区发现真正的地雷。
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test.	它们被测试和认证 通过国际地雷工作标准， 就像狗通过测试一样。
This consists of 400 square meters.	在这400平方米的雷区，
There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets.	那里有一些地雷 随意地摆放。 然后训练者和他们的鼠 需要发现所有的目标。
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way.	如果鼠成功了，它得到许可 作为被认证的动物 在雷区工作 - 就像狗。
Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog.	可能一个很小的不同是 我们可以用五分之一的价钱训练鼠 相比起训练探雷狗的价钱。
This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows.	这是我们在莫桑比克的队伍。 一个坦桑尼亚的训练者， 将本领传授给 这三个莫桑比克同伴。
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.	你应该能够看到他们眼中的自豪。
They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid.	他们有本领， 这使得他们更少得依靠 国外援助。
Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up.	进而，这个小团队 当然也需要重型卡车 和人工排雷人员一起进行后续工作。
But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down.	但是通过在鼠本领上的很小投资， 我们在莫桑比克证明 我们可以将每平方米的成本降低 百分之六十。 相比现在一般的情况 - 每平方米两美元，我们是每平方米1.18美元， 而且我们还可以进一步降低。
Question of scale.	关于发展的问题。
If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger.	如果能够使用更多的鼠， 我们就可以创造更大的产出。
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.	我们在莫桑比克有演示地点。
Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology.	11个非洲政府 看到他们通过使用这种手段就可以变得更少依赖 外部援助。
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines.	他们签订了和平的协定 和在大湖区的公约。 然后他们支持英雄鼠 去清除公共边界上的地雷。
But let me bring you to a very different problem.	但是让我告诉你们一个完全不同的问题。
And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection.	在去年大概有6000人 走到地雷上， 但是去年，全球有 近190万人死于结核病 这成为传染病的第一死因。
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem.	尤其在非洲 结核病和艾滋病紧密地结合着， 这是一个巨大的共同的问题。
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.	根据标准的世界卫生组织程序，显微镜 达到百分之四十到六十的可靠度。
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.	在坦桑尼亚 - 数字不会说谎 - 百分之四十五的人是结核病人 - 在死前被诊断出结核。
It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B.	这说明，如果你得了结核病， 你反而有更大的可能性不被检测出不适， 但仍然通过结核第二期并发症等致死。
And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.	 然后即使是艾滋病阳性，这也是可以治疗的。
You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives.	事实上，你可以治愈结核病， 即便是艾滋病阳性病毒。
So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B.	所以在我们共同的语言，荷兰语， 结核病的名称
is "tering," which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar.	是tering， 语源上是 焦油的味道。
Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients.	古代中国 和希腊希波克拉底， 实际上曾经发表了 也记载了结核病可以被诊断 通过 从病人身体排出的挥发物。
So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row.	所以我们做的是收集一些样本 - 就像测试一样 - 从医院里， 通过它们训练鼠 然后看是否有效， 并且惊奇发现， 我们的鼠可以达到百分之八十九的灵敏度， 百分之八十六的专一性 通过使用多只鼠在一组测试。
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology.	这是工作的方式。 并且实际上，这是一般的技术。
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there.	我们现在讨论的是有关爆炸物，结核， 但是你能想象， 你可以应用鼠于任何地方。
So how does it work?	所以怎么工作呢？
You have a cassette with 10 samples.	你在小盒里放10个样本。
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.	你一次在笼子里放10个样本。
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.	一只鼠仅需要0.005秒 去分辨气味，所以是非常快的。
Here it's already at the third sample.	这里已经是第三个样本了。
This is a positive sample.	这是阳性样本。
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.	它听到响声并得到食品奖励。
And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative.	这样，非常快的， 我们可以得到附属的观点 去判断病人的检测是否呈阳性， 是否呈阴性。
Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only.	就像研究显示， 当一个显微镜工作者能够处理 每天40个样本， 一只鼠能够处理 同等数量的样本 仅在7分钟。
A cage like this -- A cage like this -- provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples.	一个这样的笼子 - 一个这样的笼子 - 并且你有鼠， 现在我们有 25只结核探测鼠 - 一个这样的笼子，每天运作， 可以处理1680个样本。
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.	你能想象可能的衍生应用 - 环境探测 土地中的污染物， 海关应用， 探测容器中的非法物品等等。
But let's stick first to tuberculosis.	但是首先用于结核病。
I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done.	我想简单得强调， 蓝色的杆 是只用显微镜的结果 在Dar es Salaam达累斯萨拉姆的五个诊所 对50万人， 其中1万5千人做过测试。
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.	这是1800个病人的显微镜结果。
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent.	然后通过将这些样品多次交给鼠类 并将结果返回， 我们能够将探测率提高 超过百分之三十。
Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent.	去年一整年， 我们 - 通过不同间隔时间 - 我们持续地 提高鼠探测率 在达累斯萨拉姆的五个医院 并使鼠探测率提高到百分之三十到四十之间。
So this is really considerable.	所以这真的是很可观的。
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives.	要知道，一个被显微镜误诊的患者 会感染15个人 - 每年15个健康的人， 你可以确定 我们拯救了很多生命。
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.	至少我们的英雄鼠拯救了很多生命。
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology.	我们要做的是 现在去标准化这种技术。
And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds.	然后简单的事情随之出现 像，例如，我们在探测洞放小的激光 使鼠呆五秒。
So, to standardize this.	所以，去标准化这个事情。
Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people.	而且，去标准化小球， 食品奖励， 去半自动化这个事 为了能够在更大的范围内得到推广 并且挽救到更多人的生命。
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.	作为结束，还有很多类似的其他应用。
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on.	这是第一个模型 对我们的相机鼠， 背着背包 内装有一个相机可以在地震后走到碎石底下 去探测受害者 等等。
This is in a prototype stage.	这是在模型阶段。
We don't have a working system here yet.	我们还没有运作系统。
To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people.	作为结尾，我实际想要说， 你可能想这都有关于鼠，这些活动都涉及鼠， 但是最后这都是关于人类。
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available.	这是关于给予弱小群体能力 去处理困难棘手的，昂贵的 和危险的人类探测工作， 并且应用当地的资源 - 很多现成的资源。
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human.	所以现在很不一样的是 不断地挑战大家 对周围的资源认知， 不管是环境的， 技术的，动物或人类的认知。
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work.	然后我们要尊重并和它们和谐共处 为了实现可持续的工作。
Thank you very much.	非常感谢。
The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.	无的价值：无中生有的可能
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+.	这是一篇我在十一岁时写的作文 当时我拿了个乙等。
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.	今天我要谈的是创作，和无中生有的艺术
And I'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within, and to follow the TED commandments: that is, actually, something that creates a near-death experience, but near-death is good for creativity.	我不但要试着在 大会给我的18分钟时限中完成 并且遵守TED的严格戒律： 我必须说，这些戒律的确让我 有一种濒临死亡的感觉 但濒临死亡是有益于创作的
OK.	好
So, I also want to explain, because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.	我还想顺便提到 如果我说谎，或是说的东西不能普世通用 大卫艾格说他将会严厉地质问我
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.	这个图是为了听众中的科学家画的
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.	当我使用我们的时候，我不一定是指你 而是说我，和我的右脑，我的左脑 还有在它们中间那负责审查的东西 如果我说错了什么，它将会提醒我
And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, which includes a number of things that happened, actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new.	我也将会谈论 我个人的创作过程 那包含了一些不同的事件 无在更早之前发生 在我开始创作之前就发生了
And that includes nature, and nurture, and what I refer to as nightmares.	那包括了天份，滋养 还有我叫做梦魇的东西
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something, perhaps in our brains, some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect.	在天份的方面，我们必须要检视 我们是否生来就有这天赋，或者 在我们的大脑里，是否有些一些不正常的染色体 带来了这些像是灵感的效应
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.	有些人会用别的方法说这是我们与生俱来的
And others, like my mother, would say that I get my material from past lives.	还有一些人，像我的母亲 会说我是从前世里找到这些写作材料的
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.	有些人会说创作力 是一种精神异常的副作用 -- 类似梵高症候群 -- 就是你有一点精神失常，或是忧郁症
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic, that he might have had temporal lobe seizures, and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.	但我必须告诉这些人 -- 最近我才读到 梵高其实不一定是精神病患 而更可能得了一种颞叶癫痫症 造成了他这种突然性的创作力 我想那的确会影响你一部分的大脑
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time I was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different.	我也必须提到，事实上 数年前我也有过这种颞叶癫痫 那时我正在写我的上一本书 有些人说那本书很不同
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis: you know, who am I, why am I this particular person, why am I not black like everybody else?	还有一部分是从身份危机开始的： 我是谁，为什么我是这个我 为什么我不像别人一样是黑人？
And sometimes you're equipped with skills, but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.	有时候，你装备着那些技能 但它们可能不是一些能带来创造力的技能
I used to draw.	我以前还会画画。
I thought I would be an artist.	我曾以为我会成为一个画家
And I had a miniature poodle.	这是我画的迷你贵宾狗
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.	似乎还不坏，但实在算不上什么创意
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.	因为我所能做的不过是把它们一个个画下来
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.	而且我很有可能还是从一本书上抄绘下来的
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words.	但是我在我真正想要的地方又似乎表现的不是太出色 你知道，你看着那些成绩，是不很差 但也绝不可能让我预测到 有天我竟然能用写作来谋生
Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.	创意的其中一项原则是拥有童年的心理创伤
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.	我想我有的创伤和一般人一样 来自父母对子女过分热切的期望
That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.	那具人体模型 是我在九岁的时候得到的一件玩具， 以助我在童年时期就能踏上成为医生康庄大道
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure.	还有一些持续比较久的心理创伤：从五到十五岁 成为一个钢琴家理应变成我的第二职业 但最终它只变成我感觉失败的来源
But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14.	但事实上在我人生中是有一些真实的心理创伤 发生在我十四岁的时候
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father, six months later, had brain tumors.	就是发现我的兄弟，在1967年，然后我的父亲 六个月以后，双双长了脑瘤
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.	我母亲相信有些事情出错了 她想找出原因，然后解决它
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles, and that God's will would take care of that.	我父亲是个牧师，他相信神迹 他相信神会解决那些问题
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.	但当然，他们都过世了，中间隔了六个月
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.	在那之后，我母亲相信那是命运，是诅咒 她找遍了宇宙间所有可能的理由 为什么这件事会发生
Everything except randomness.	除了偶然以外所有的理由。
She did not believe in randomness.	她不相信偶然
There was a reason for everything.	每件事都有原因
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother, who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.	她相信其中一件原因是在她的母亲 她相信在她幼年就过世的母亲怨恨她
And so, I had this notion of death all around me, because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.	所以我总被死亡的阴影笼罩着 因为我母亲还相信我会是下一个，或是她会是下一个
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon, you begin to think very much about everything.	当你面对死亡的时候 你开始认真思考每件事情
You become very creative, in a survival sense.	你开始非常有创造力，从一种争取生存的角度来说
And this, then, led to my big questions.	这让我想到一个大问题
And they're the same ones that I have today.	一些我今日仍然在想的问题
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?	为什么事情会发生，它们是怎么发生的？
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?	和我母亲问的那句：我怎么让这些事情发生的？
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.	在撰写故事的时候，这都是一些很重要的问题
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300, you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen, in what order they happen. What are the influences?	因为你必须三百页的篇幅中回答这些问题： 为什么事情会这样发生，它是怎么发生的 事情发生的顺序和影响
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?	我，身为一个述说者，对这个故事又有什么影响？
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.	我想这也是所有科学家所问的问题
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe, as the creator of that universe.	我在我的世界中发展出自己的宇宙观 像一个宇宙的创造者。
And you see, there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out -- years and years, oftentimes.	这中间有许多的反复 尝试着创造，尝试着理出头绪 年复一年，往往。
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.	当我想到创作力的时候，我也认为 这来自一种对日常生活中每件事无法压抑的看法。
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on.	我在许多事件发生时做出观察 在这个大会中， 几乎是所有发生的事情。
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association: quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand, but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor.	让我在这里用量子力学做比喻： 虽然我并不理解量子力学， 但我将以它做为一种过程 来解释为何它是个比喻。
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.	在量子力学中，有着暗能量和暗物质。
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.	就像我们尝试解释事情为何会发生的时候
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.	有许多未知，你不知道那是什么，只知道它不在
But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters.	但当你尝试找出关联性时 当你希望能在故事中把事件连接起来时 你突然发现了事物的核心。
The meaning.	它的意义。
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.	这就是我在我的作品中所想要找寻的，对我而言的意义。
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it.	在量子力学中还有测不准原理， 至少我想有。
And this happens constantly in the writing.	同样的事也时常发生在写作中。
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about.	还有一种可怕的观者效应， 当你在找寻一些事情的时候， 那些同时发生的事情， 你尝试用不同角度去看它， 你尝试找出它和其他事物的关联性， 或是这个故事和什么有关。
And if you try too hard, then you will only write the about.	如果你过分强求， 最后你写下的只是关联。
You won't discover anything.	却什么也没发现。
And what you were supposed to find, what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way, is no longer there.	而你应该找到的， 你真正希望能找到的，在无意中， 却已经不在了。
Now, I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe, like many of our scientists have.	我并不想忽略 在宇宙另一边发生的事， 像一些科学家所做的一样。
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.	所以在这里我也要顺便谈谈弦理论， 证明创意人不仅是多维的， 还有着十一种层次的焦虑。
And they all operate at the same time.	而且它们全部一起发生。
There is also a big question of ambiguity.	再来还有模棱两可的问题。
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.	像是你们说的宇宙常数。
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.	你不明白什么在运作，但有些事情在运作。
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.	模棱两可是一种非常不舒服的感觉，对我的人生来说 但它仍然存在。
Moral ambiguity.	道德的不确定性
It is constantly there.	总是存在着。
And, just as an example, this is one that recently came to me.	举例来说， 最近刚发生了一件事。
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq.	在我从事编辑工作时，我读到 一个女人在描写伊拉克战争时， 她使用了一句很有名的中国谚语
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.	
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved.	意味着既然我们进入了伊拉克，我们便应该长驻 直到事情解决。
You know, maybe even 100 years.	你知道，就算要上百年
So, there was another one that I came across, and it's "saving fish from drowning."	还有另一个例子 就是救溺水的游鱼
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say, because they're not supposed to kill anything.	来自一个信仰佛教的渔夫 佛教相信人不该杀生
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.	但渔夫却仍得谋生，养家
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning, and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.	为了将杀生合理化，他们声称自己是在救溺水的鱼 但鱼不幸地在过程中死了。
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business, or you're going to get stuck.	但我想如果真的有人溺水的话，她还是会救他们的
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.	我们在人生中，都得对我们身边发生的事情做出反应
And then we have intentions.	怀抱着各自的意图
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do, and then we do something.	在我们应该做的，和最后真正做了的两者之间 有一些模棱两可之处
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.	而结果也不一定符合我们原本的意图
Maybe things go wrong.	说不定事情搞砸了。
And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?	若当如此，我们的责任又在哪？
What are we supposed to do?	我们该怎么做？
Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?	我们该留下来负责 还是尝试合理化我们的行为，说，我的本意是好的 所以我不应当负全责
That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called "Saving Fish From Drowning."	这便是我人生中很难接受的模棱两可 甚至让我因此写了本书，就叫做 救一只溺水的鱼
I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.	一旦你意识到这个问题，就发现它无所不在
I got these hints everywhere.	在哪里都能看到它的痕迹
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.	同时我也知道，它们一直都在那里。
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues, and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.	在写作上，我看见这些暗示，这些线索 我意识到它们一直都在那，但又隐身不见
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.	我需要的是焦点
And when I have the question, it is a focus.	当我有一个问题要问的时候，它就是一个焦点
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.	那些在人生中的灾难都会过去 这些问题，和在这些事件中所发生的事都是有关联的
And it seems like it's happening all the time.	而且它无处不在
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity, in which you're getting all this help from the universe.	你以为它不过是偶发事件，或是碰巧发生的 或许是来自宇宙的帮忙
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.	也可以解释成，心中有了焦点以后
And you are noticing it more often.	你更能发现它的存在
But you apply this.	当你开始应用它
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.	你开始检视那些令你紧张的事情
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?	当你的兄弟遇上了麻烦，你该帮助他吗？
Why or why not?	为什么要，又为什么不要？
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in Burma.	它或许比你想象的更为严肃 像缅甸的人权问题
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show that I approved of the military regime there.	我本来想着我是否不应该去，因为有人告诉我 我在那里出现意味着我支持当地的军权统治
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself, "Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us?"	但一阵子以后，我自问 为什么我们要在意他人对我们的想法 或认知？
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up, and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father, who was a Baptist minister.	这和我在成长过程中的感觉很像 我身为牧师的父亲 给我们的所有规则和道德指标
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.	最后我决定为了我自己去缅甸 而我仍然不知道，到了那里 写一本书，结果又会如何 但我只能等到时机出现的时候，再来面对这些问题
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.	我们总是在意这世界上我们所感知的事物
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?	我们对自己说：我能做什么？
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals, so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?	不是每个人都可以去非洲，或是在医院工作 我又该如何处理我里面的这个道德感？
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at, and we talked about today, is genocide.	我想今日的一个重要议题是 种族灭绝
This leads to this question.	我们再次回到同样的问题
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe?	当我遇见这些在道德上模棱两可，让我感觉不舒服的事件 我的心态又是如何？ 我认知到这让我再次回到孩提时所遇见的身份认知议题 为什么我在这里，人生的意义时什么 我在宇宙间的位置是什么？
It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.	这看起来似乎很明显，但一点也不
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense, and yet it is also absolutely necessary.	我们都不喜欢道德上的不确定性 但这种不确定感确是绝对必要的
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.	在我写作的时候，这便是我开始的地方
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.	有时看上去似乎我受到宇宙的帮助
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.	我母亲说从第一本开始，灵感就来自我祖母的鬼魂 因为我似乎知道许多我不应该知道的事
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally, from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time, I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself, and that actually was the way it happened.	我没有描写我的祖母 是因为吃了过量的鸦片而意外过世的 而在故事里描写那女人自杀了 那却是我本来不知道的事实
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.	我母亲认为这些资讯一定来自我祖母的鬼魂。
There are also things, quite uncanny, which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.	除此以外，还有一些离奇的事件 在写作时为我带来了不同的写作资料
In this case, I was writing a story that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.	当时我正在写一个古代的故事 需要那个年代的历史和地理资料
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.	来补足故事中的细节
And I took down this book, and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period, and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion, happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that, and a character who thought he was the son of God.	我从书架上拿下这本书 我翻开的第一页便是我故事里的时代和地点 和我在描写太平天国时所需要的人物 在一个接近桂林的地方 和一个认为他是神的儿子的人物。
You wonder, are these things random chance?	你不禁想，这一切都是偶然的吗？
Well, what is random?	但偶然是什么？
What is chance?	机会是什么？
What is luck?	运气又是什么？
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?	那些从天而降的灵感又是什么？
And that goes into the story, too.	这也成为故事的一部分
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.	这些就是我日复一日想着的事
Especially when good things happen, and, in particular, when bad things happen.	在好事发生的时候 尤其，在坏事发生的时候
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.	但我是相信这种突发灵感的 我也想知道它们形成的元素是什么 我才能感谢，和找到它们
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.	因为，我想，我越能察觉它们，它们就发生的越频繁
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place, and we ended up in this non-tourist location, a beautiful village, pristine.	还有一次是一个地方 我只是和朋友漫无目的地开着车 却到了这个旅游景点以外之地 一个淳朴的，古朴的村庄
And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.	我们越过了三个山谷 在第三个山谷，我有些神秘的，不舒服的预感 我知道这将成为我故事的场景。
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.	我不知道为什么我这样写，但那景象很鲜明
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure.	我陷入了困境，一个朋友问我要不要和她去遛狗 我说好。
And about 45 minutes later, walking along the beach, I came across this.	四十五分钟后 我在海滩上遇见了一个男人
And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.	一个中国男人 他正堆着这些东西。没有胶水，没有任何工具
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"	我问他，这怎么可能？
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."	他说，世间每件事 都有一个平衡点
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.	那便是我故事里所要讲的重点
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story, and I cannot explain it.	在我的写作过程中 这样的事时常发生 我无法解释
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things?	是否因为我有一种特殊的过滤法 因为这些强烈的巧合正是我想写的事？
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?	或是这真是一些我们所不能解释的突发事件 从天而来？
A big thing that I also think about is accidents.	我也时常想到意外
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.	如我所说 我母亲从不相信偶然
What is the nature of accidents?	那意外又是什么？
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are, outside of a court of law?	对于那些法律以外的事件，我们又该如何处理面对 它们的责任归属？
I was able to see that in a firsthand way, when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.	我有一个切身的经验 我曾经到中国最贫穷的贵州省里的侗族
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.	我看见这个美丽的地方 我知道我想再回来
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China.	当国家地理杂志问我想不想写一些有关中国的文章 我知道我的机会来了
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.	我说好，我想写这个唱歌的少数民族
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident.	它们同意了。
A man, an old man, fell asleep, and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.	就在我两次拜访中间 一个悲惨的意外发生了。一个老人 在睡眠中把被子掉在了暖炉上
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.	六十户人家全毁，四十户遭到损坏
Responsibility was assigned to the family.	这个家庭得担负责任
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.	老人的儿子被放逐到三公里外的牛棚
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.	西方人会说：但那是个不过是个意外，这不公平
It's the son, not the father."	父债不该子还
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.	但当我下笔写这个故事的时候，我得放弃那些原来的想法
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.	这得花上一些时间，但是我必须克服自己，纯粹得去那里亲身经历。
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.	所以我在不同的季节里去了三次
And I began to sense something different about the history, and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village, and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links with other families.	在这个贫穷的村庄里 我开始对历史 之前发生的事件 和人生的本质 有了不同的感受 什么是让你感到快乐的，你的仪式, 你的传统，我们和其他家庭产生关系的方式。
And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.	 我开始明白这样的责任归属中，有它自己的正义。
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years.	我也开始了解他们使用的仪式。 一个二十九年没用过的仪式。
And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.	 让一个风水师送一些人 乘着鬼马进阴间。
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition.	你，身为一个西方人，如我，身为一个西方人， 会说：那不过是迷信。
But after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen.	但在那里待了一段时间以后， 亲眼见识到这些神奇的事， 你开始想，究竟是谁的信仰，运作在这个世界上， 决定事情该如何发生。
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.	所以我决定留下来和他们一起 ，我写的越多， 我便越相信这些信仰，这对我来说是重要的 － 去真正接受这些信仰，因为这样，故事才能真实， 那便是我找到的答案 来解决我人生问题的地方。
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.	随着时间过去，我也写了很多作品，但这不是在一瞬间发生的， 在这里，我想对你们说的是
The book comes and it goes.	这些书来了又走。
When it arrives, it is no longer my book.	当它来到的时候，它已不再属于我，
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.	而在每个读者手中，他们有不同的解读。
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?	但我仍然回到同样的问题，我如何无中生有？
And how do I create my own life?	我如何创造自己的生命？
And I think it is by questioning, and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.	我对它提出问题， 并告诉我自己，它没有一个确定的答案。
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story, and the past, the specifics of that past, and what is happening in the story at that point.	我相信那些具体的事，故事中的细节， 和往事，往事中的细节， 及当时故事中所发生的事。
I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.	我也相信，在我们考量着这些， 有关运气 、命运 、巧合和意外， 天意，和这些神秘力量的互动时， 我将会对我们的创造力有些概念。
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe, and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?	我思考自己的角色 在宇宙中的原因 是否有人要我成为现在这个样子，或是那完全出于我自己？
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.	我可以借着想象来找到答案，或成为自己想象的模样 在那真实世界，虚构世界，
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.	这便是我找到部分真理的办法，不是绝对的，或是完全的真理，
And they have to be in all possibilities, including those I never considered before.	它们仍有许多可能性。 包括那些我从未想到的
So, there are never complete answers.	从没有完整的答案
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything, and that is good, because then I will discover something new.	就算有，也是为了提醒我自己。 一切都是变化无常的 那是件好事 因为我总能发现新东西
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me, it is to simply imagine.	如果有一个片段的答案 一个更完整的答案 便是简单的想象
And to imagine is to put myself in that story, until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.	想象便是将自己放进故事里 直到我和我的故事间完全透明 毫无距离
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think, to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.	那便是我发现 若我能感觉到故事里的情节 那么 我便接近了 懂得了什么是同感 去完整的感受这同感
Because for everything, in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.	因为对每件事来说 当我们问事情是怎么发生的 那便和感受有关
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.	我必须成为故事的一部分才能理解
We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us.	当我们来到演讲的最后 我将揭露袋子里的是什么，那是灵感 是改变我们人生的事物 那些美好的 从不离弃的
There she is.	它在这里。
Thank you very much!	非常感谢！
So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools.	在推特之外的闲暇时间 我对在线讲故事 做了一点实验， 看看我们能用新的数字工具做些什么。
And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with.	我在推特的工作， 实际上是花了一点时间 与作者和讲故事的人合作， 一起扩展 人们正在实验创造新媒介的疆域。
And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.	我今天想谈一些 人们在网上所做的事情， 我认为那实在是够吸引人的， 人们在网络上运用灵活的身份或匿名 使事实与虚构之间的界限逐渐模糊。
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.	但我想先从1930年代开始。
Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast.	在推特这件小事发明之前， 无线电带给我们的是广播 它以单点广播 连接了数以百万计的人们。
And from those single points emanated stories.	而从广播中播放出来的故事，
Some of them were familiar stories.	有一些是我们熟悉的故事。
Some of them were new stories.	有一些是新的故事。
And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium.	有一段时间这些故事是以熟悉的方式来述说的， 然后电台就开始进化成 自己独特的模式。
Think about episodes that happened live on radio.	想想在广播电台现场直播发生的情节。
Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format.	结合现场表演 和书面小说连载的模式， 就变成了一种新形式。
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.	我以收音机作例的原因是我认为 电台是证明一个新的媒介如何 运用新形式去讲故事的很好的例子。
And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world.	当然，今天，我们有全新的 媒介可供使用， 那就是互联网络世界。
This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them.	这是使用推特的认证用户 以及他们之间是如何连接的地图。
There are thousands upon thousands of them.	有成千上万的人。
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster.	每一个点 都是自己的广播站。
We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.	我们已经来到了一个很多人需要发声的时代， 对连接彼此介质的使用权成为了广播的最大障碍。
And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.	我认为我们应该开始看到 随着人们学会如何在这个新媒体上讲故事 许多新模式正在应运而生。
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.	我相信我们是在广泛开放 创新实验的前沿， 我们已经探讨并开始定义 互联网的这个广阔的土地 并要开始准备 在互联网上建立框架， 而这些框架就是互联网使我们创造 新的说故事的模式。
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods.	我相信这起源于对 现有方式的变革。
The short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.	短篇故事，例如， 众人所说短篇故事 因为电子书阅读器和数字市场的产生 正在经历一种复兴。
One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called "Wool."	作家Hugh Howey试验了 在亚马逊网站上 发布了一个非常短的故事叫羊毛。
And he actually says that he didn't intend for "Wool" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more.	他说他实际上根本没打算 把羊毛变成一个系列， 但读者那么喜欢第一个故事 他们要求续集，所以他给了读者续集。
He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one, "Wool 3," which was even longer, culminating in "Wool 5," which was a 60,000-word novel.	他又写了羊毛2，比羊毛1篇幅长一些， 羊毛 3更长一些， 最终在羊毛 5 达到顶峰 一个 6万字的小说。
I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books.	我认为Howey能够做到这一切都是因为 电子书的快速回馈功能。
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order.	他能在相对较短的时间内 撰写以及发布。
There was no mediator between him and the audience.	在他和他的读者之间没有中介物做阻碍。
It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him.	他和他的读者 通过读者给予的回馈和热情 直接连系起来。
So this whole project was an experiment.	所以这整个项目是一项实验。
It started with the one short story, and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format.	它开始于一个短篇故事， 我觉得实验实际上成为了 Howey模式的一部分。
And that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.	这就是这一媒介所赋予的， 并在成为这一个媒介的一部分。
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called "Black Box."	这是Jennifer Egan的一个短篇故事 叫做黑箱。
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind.	它起初是 明确与推特有关的故事
Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created.	Egan 说服纽约客杂志 启动一个纽约客小说帐户 在这个账户里他们可以通过推特发布 所有她撰写的故事。
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.	推特当然有140个的字符限制。
Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.	Egan直接用手写的方式在 写生簿上涂写 运用这些方框里 物理空间的限制 写入每一个独立的推文， 而这些超过六百篇的推文最终都变成了 纽约客杂志上的连载。
Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.	每天晚上八点，你都可以调到 纽约客小说账号的短篇故事。
I think that's pretty exciting: tune-in literary fiction.	我认为这是很令人兴奋的： 收看文学小说。
The experience of Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.	Egan的故事，当然， 有很多种方法来实现它。
You could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them.	你可以回看它， 但有趣的是，如果看这个故事的直播， 它本身造成了一种悬念 因为当你阅读他们的时候 你是没有办法控制这些推文的。
They were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, The New Yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.	他们在一个平均的剪辑速度上进行， 但是随着故事逐渐的推进， 通常，作为一个读者，你可以控制阅读文本的速度， 但在这种情况下，纽约客杂志所做的是， 他们给你一点，一点，再一点， 让读者有悬念并且期待下一行。
Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."	另外一个在推特上关于小说和短篇故事的 一个很好的例子是， 作家Elliott Holt， 他写了一个故事叫《证据》。
It began with this tweet: "On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."	这个故事始于这则推文：十一月二十八日， 晚上十点十三分， 一个女人，认定为米兰达布朗， 四十四岁，来自布鲁克利， 从曼哈顿酒店屋顶坠楼身亡。
It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.	开始是Elliott的声音， 然后Elliott的声音褪去， 我们看到的是Elsa, Margot和Simon, 这些Elliott在推特上特别创建的角色 专门来讲述这个故事， 故事从许多个视角进行讲述 最终引领读者到达了晚上十点十三分，
when this woman falls to her death.	也就是这个女人坠楼身亡的时间。
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives.	这三个角色使这个故事从多方视角进行述说， 给读者带来了一种真实感。
One reviewer called Elliott's story "Twitter fiction done right," because she did.	一个批评家说Elliott的故事 是名符其实的推特小说， 因为她做到了。
She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.	她捕捉到了那个声音 并且她有许多角色， 这个故事也发生在真实的时间内。
Interestingly, though, it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism.	有趣的是，这不仅仅只是 将推特作为一个发布故事的机制。
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.	也将推特作为一个产生故事的机制。
Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.	Elliott后来告诉我 她用她的大拇指写了整个故事。
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line.	她在沙发上坐定，也就只是 在不同的角色间来来回回 一行一行的发推文。
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.	我认为这种同步性创造 故事中角色们的推文 赋予了这些角色本身的真实性 并且也对这个她在推特上创造的 用多重视角讲述一个故事的方式赋予了真实性。
As you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world.	当你在网络上运用灵活的身份， 并与真实世界开始互动的时候， 它变得越发有趣。
Things like Invisible Obama or the famous "binders full of women" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing," including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode.	就像在2012年选举期推特上出现的 隐形奥巴马 或者著名的装满女性简历的档案 （罗姆尼竞选时回答男女薪金公平性的引语，被推特、脸书上的网名调侃） 甚至是白宫风云在推特上的粉丝专页 在这里，你能找到在白宫风云里 所有角色的推特账号， 甚至包括在某一集里 停在Josh Lyman窗口的一只鸟。
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.	所有这些都是关于一个主题的复述。
They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.	他们是一群有创意的人 对于在这媒介上可能性的探索。
You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world.	你可以看到在白宫风云推特上 这些虚拟角色 与真实世界进行互动。
They comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of Congress.	他们对政治进行评论， 与国会的邪恶进行抗争。
Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.	请记住，他们都是民主党人。
And they engage with the real world.	他们与真实的世界进行互动
They respond to it.	做出反应。
So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.	所以一旦你采取灵活的身份， 匿名，与现实世界互动 你就超越了简单的敬意或模仿 而把这些工具都用来讲述一个故事， 事情就变得有趣起来。
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account.	所以在芝加哥市长选举期间， 有一个模仿账户
It was Mayor Emanuel.	就是Emanuel市长。
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel, particularly in the expletive department.	这个账户给你所有你想要 从Rahm Emanuel那里了解的事情 尤其是以脏话调侃的形式。
This foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went.	这个满嘴脏话的账户 追踪竞选的日常活动， 随着活动的进行给予评论。
It followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid Twitter parody account, but then started to get weird.	它一开始还遵守着 一个好的推特模仿账户该有的守则， 然后就开始变得很奇怪。
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is -- it didn't actually happen.	随着它的进展，它从评论性演变到了 一个多周的、 实时的虚拟小说 在这里面主角，Rahm Emanuel， 在选举日期间去各种旅行， 这是— — 实际上不会发生的事。
I double checked the newspapers.	我翻阅了报纸新闻。
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.	然后，非常有趣的是，它结束了。
This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account.	这是一个推特模拟账户 通常不会发生的事情。
It ended, a true narrative conclusion.	它结束了，一个真实的叙述性结论。
And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.	所以作者，Dan Sinker，是一名记者， 在这段时间内，是完全匿名的 我想对于Dan来说，这是很有意义的， 他想要把这变成一本书， 因为它是以一种叙述手法画下一个句点的， 而且我认为，把它变成一本书 代表着他创造的一种新形式 被转化到了前一种形式。
One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.	一个我最喜欢的例子之一是 现在在推特上正在进行的事， 实际上就是那个荒诞的Crimer Show.
Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show.	Crimer Show讲的是一个 超级罪犯和一个倒霉侦探 像在上电视节目一样， 进行着一些非常奇怪的对话。
Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird.	Crimer Show的主创说 这是对英国的一种流行表演的模仿， 但是，老兄，这可真奇怪。
And there are all these times where Crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.	Crimer，这个超级罪犯， 做的这些个电视行为。
He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text.	他总是拿下他的太阳镜 或是转身对着相机， 但这些事情只是发生在文本中。
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new.	我想借用这些电视上的行为 放在每一集 Crimer Show里面 并将它们视为情节 真的，它在创建一个新的东西。
There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way.	每一天推特上都上演着 Crimer Show的新一集。 并且以这种方式存储下来。
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.	我认为这是在对于模式的一种很好的实验。
Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.	一个全新的模式出现了， 模仿电视上发生的一切。
I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.	我认为在非小说类作品中实时讲故事， 真的有很多很好的例子。
RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day.	RealTimeWWII 是一个 记录60 年前的今天发生了什么的账号， 它记录的格外详细， 就像你在阅读在那天的新闻报道一样。
And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news.	作者Teju Cole 对于将新闻事件的文学性报道 做了许多实验。
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.	比如说，这里他在讲无人机轰炸。
I think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.	我认为，在这些例子里 你开始看到人们运用非小说类作品内容 在说故事 这可以以一种新的虚构故事的模式 来进行。
So with real-time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks.	所以有了实时讲故事， 事实与虚构之间的界限逐渐模糊， 真实的世界和数字世界， 灵活的身份，匿名性， 这些我们可以使用的工具， 而我认为他们只是其中的一小部分而已。
They are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.	他们是我们 构造结构、框架的一小部分， 它将会成为我们在之上建立的 创新实验的广泛开放前沿。
Thank you.	谢谢。

I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.	当时我醒悟到 我认为自己完全控制了自己的人生 但我仅仅控制了3件事 我的思想，我的情绪—— 这些思想所创造的想象 和由这些想象所引起的行动

I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.	我在化疗和放射的期间跳舞 我纠缠着让他使治疗周期 配合我的舞蹈计划
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.	我所成就的是 我摆脱了癌症 专注于我的舞蹈
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.	是的，癌症只成为我生命中的一页
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you.	我的故事 是一个克服挫折 障碍和挑战的故事 那些生命带给你的
My story is the power of thought.	我的故事是思想的力量
My story is the power of choice.	我的故事是选择的力量
It's the power of focus.	是专注的力量
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.	这是一种力量让我们注意那些 赋予我们生机活力 深刻的感动我们 和令癌症变得无足轻重的东西
My story is the power of a metaphor.	我的故事是意境的力量
It's the power of an image.	是意象的力量
Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one.	我的意象是杜尔迦 杜尔迦无畏的女神
She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.	她也叫做Simhanandini 骑狮子的人
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror.	在我度过难关的过程中 我驾驭了我自己的内在力量 我的内在恢复力 我武装自己并联合治疗效果 我继续治疗 我经历了与癌症的战争 我命令那些肆意妄为的细胞顺从起来 我希望被世人认可，不是作为癌症幸存者 而是作为癌症征服者
I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini."	我向你们呈现一段我的舞蹈 狮子吼经
Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks, as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing, checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.	Jambo, bonjour, zdraveite, trayo。这些是几种不同的语言， 我在过去六周里多多少少用到了它们。 我在进行一个非常疯狂的旅行，总共要跑十七个国家， 去为我们正在做的项目做各种各样的事。
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.	我现在就要向你们介绍这个项目。
And visiting some pretty incredible places, places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice -- I was here a month ago.	我也见到了各种绝妙的风土人情。 像是蒙古，柬埔寨，新几内亚，南非，我还来过两次坦桑尼亚。 一个月前来过一次。
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.	这种旋风式的全球旅行的机会 是绝妙十足的，原因很多，
You see some incredible stuff.	你能长不少见识，
And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe.	同时你还能比较不同的地区， 比较全球的人种。
And the thing that you really take away from that, the kind of surface thing that you take away from it, is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that, but rather how different we are.	最重要的是你意识到， 那种最明显的感觉就是， 并不是我们又多么像一个整体，尽管我想和你们讨论这方面。
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes.	六十五亿人口，不同肤色，不同高矮胖瘦， 讲着六千种不同的语言。
You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that, and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.	当你做这样的旅行，当你在任何大城市的大街上漫步， 你会被人类的多样性所惊服。
How do we explain that diversity?	怎样解释这种多样性呢？
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took.	这正是我今天要讲的。 就是我们怎样用遗传学的方法， 特别是人口遗传学，来说明我们是怎么进化出多样性的， 还有花了多长时间产生多样性的。
Now, the problem of human diversity, like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions.	现在，人类多样性的问题， 就像是所有那些重要的科学问题， 很难一下子说清楚。 我们可以把这个大问题分解成一些小问题，
And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.	然后你就能一个个地解决。
First one is really a question of origins.	第一个小问题其实是关于人类的起源。
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?	我们到底是不是从同一个起点来的？
And given that we do -- and that's the assumption everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that?	如果是的话，这也是每个人都赞同的假说， 又是在什么时候？
When did we originate as a species?	从什么时候我们作为一个物种开始存在？
How long have we been divergent from each other?	我们已经开始分支了多长时间？
And the second question is related, but slightly different.	第二个小问题和这个有关，但是很不一样。
If we do spring from a common source, how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe, and in the process generate all of this diversity, the different ways of life, the different appearances, the different languages around the world?	那就是如果我们都是从一个起点来的， 又是怎样散布到世界的各个角落， 怎样一步步产生不同的人种， 不同的生活方式，不同的样貌， 不同的语言的呢？
Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology, seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.	关于起源的问题，就像很多其他生物学上的问题一样， 看起来已经被达尔文在一百年前就回答了。
In "The Descent of Man," he wrote, "In each great region of the world, the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.	在他的书人类的起源中，他写道： 在世界的每个区域，现存的哺乳动物 都和同一区域灭绝的物种紧密相连。
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere."	因此很有可能非洲从前有类人猿，现在灭绝了， 而它们和大猩猩以及黑猩猩相关。 这两个物种是现今人类的最接近的物种， 由此可见，人类的早期祖先 最有可能生活在非洲大陆上，而不是别处。
So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question.	这样问题就解决了，我们可以回家了，我们回答了起源的问题。
Well, not quite.	等等，并没有完全回答。
Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes.	因为达尔文讲的是我们的远祖， 我们和猿类共享的始祖。
And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.	很明显猿类是从非洲大陆来的。
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.	根据化石记载它们是在两百三十万年前出现的。
Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time, due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.	非洲已经和其他大陆分隔开了。 由于捉摸不定的的板块构造，非洲在印度洋上漂浮，
Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago, and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.	大约一百六十万年前，撞到欧亚板块上， 我们就有了第一次的所谓的非洲物种外流。
The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia, became the gibbons and the orangutans.	那时候离开非洲的猿类到达了东南亚， 演变成了长臂猿和猩猩。
And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.	那些留在非洲的猿类 演变成了大猩猩，黑猩猩，和我们人类。
So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes, it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.	所以，如果你指的是我们和猿类的共同祖先， 只要看化石纪录，毫无疑义地，我们是从非洲来的。
But that's not really the question I'm asking.	但是这并不是我想知道的问题。
I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room.	我指的是原始人类， 从它们变成为人类开始算， 就好像是原始人类现在就在这个房间，
If they were peering over your shoulder, you wouldn't leap back, like that.	如果它们就在你边上， 你不会吓得往后退。
What about our human ancestry?	什么是原始人类？
Because if we go far enough back, we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.	如果我们追溯起源。 我们能够找到和世界上所有生命的共同起源。
DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.	DNA把我们联系起来，我们甚至和梭鱼， 细菌，蘑菇，都有共同祖先，如果你真的是往回找上十亿年的话。
What we're asking about though is human ancestry.	我们这里讲的是原始的人类祖先。
How do we study that?	怎么研究呢？
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.	古生人类学已经研究了很多年了，
Digging things up out of the ground, and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying, "This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.	他们挖掘古生物遗迹， 大部分的分类是根据样貌， 古生物是什么样子的，多数是根据头骨的样子，好比说 这个比那个看起来更像我们一点点，那么这个想必是我的祖先。
This must be who I'm directly descended from."	我想必是从这个起源演化来的。
The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue, gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry, but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.	我得说，古生人类学 向我们提供了很多非常有价值的可能性， 但是没有给我们提供每种可能性的概率，那才是科学家们真正需要的。
What do I mean by that?	怎么说呢？
You're looking at a great example here.	这里是个很好的例子：
These are three extinct species of hominids, potential human ancestors.	三个灭绝了的原始人种， 每个都可能是人类的祖先。
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.	它们都是在 Olduvai Gorge 以西被 Leakey 家族发掘的。
And they're all dating to roughly the same time.	它们也都是从差不多同一个时期来的。
From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei, the robust australopithecine.	从左到右，我们有直立人，能人 和南方古猿 — 现在叫做鲍氏傍人的， 也就是更新世灵长类动物。
Three extinct species, same place, same time.	三个已经灭绝的物种，存在于同一个空间，同一个时间。
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.	这说明不可能每一个都是我们的祖先。
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?	到底哪一个是呢？
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.	都有可能性，但是我们要看的是哪个机率更大。
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently -- again, largely skull shape.	另一个方法是看人体形态 这也是最近才有的方法 — 大部分是靠头骨的形状。
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet.	第一个系统地做这件事的人叫 Linnaeus， Carl von Linne， 是个瑞士植物学家， 十八世纪的人，自己一个人 把地球上所有存在的生物分了类。
You think you've got a tough job?	你还抱怨你的工作难做么？
And he did a pretty good job.	他还做得很不错。
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said, "Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."	但是看看世界上那么多不同的人种，他说： 你知道，我们看起来是差别细微的亚种，或者只是不同类的智人。
And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans, and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus," which basically included all the people he didn't like, including imaginary folk like elves.	他提到了非洲人，美洲人，亚洲人和欧洲人， 也公然地把所有他不喜欢的人种 一古脑儿归类成 monstrosus， 其中还包括了想象中的人物，比如精灵。
It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-Darwinian era.	我们很容易对这个结果嗤之以鼻， 虽然这个研究的意图是好的， 毕竟这是达尔文出现前十八世纪的比较愚昧的研究。
Except, if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity.	不过，如果你去上人类学的课， 大概二三十年前， 很多时候你还是学的同样的人类分类法呢。
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago -- Carlton Coon is the best example -- had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era -- for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.	人类种族，在三四十年前的人类学家来看 — Carlton Coon 是最好的例子 — 从直立人时代以来，已经相互分离了 — 这已经是后达尔文时代了 — 一百万年还不止。
But based on what data?	但是有什么证据呢？
Very little.	很少，几乎没有。
Very little.	形态学和很多猜想而已。
Well, what I'm going to talk about today, what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.	 现在要讲的，是一个全新的研究方法。
Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry, digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors, and saying it on the basis of morphology -- which we still don't completely understand, we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation -- what we need to do is turn the problem on its head.	不是光靠出去满处挖掘， 猜想谁是你可能的祖先， 就靠着谁长得像， 更别提我们还不太明白怎么确定谁长得像呢。
Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem, or a genealogical question.	 因为我们并不完全理解基因变异怎么导致了形态的改变。 我们要做的是变被动为主动，
What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.	因为说到底这是一个家谱的研究。 或者说是家谱问题。
And as any genealogist will tell you -- anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?	就像家谱学家对你说的 — 有没有谁家族里有人，或者就是你自己， 试图追根溯源，画出家谱的？
You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.	你从确信对的亲属关系开始，
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common.	你和你的兄弟姐妹，同样的父母，
You and your cousins share a grandparent in common.	然后加上你的表亲，你们的祖父母是相同的。
You gradually trace further and further back into the past, adding these ever more distant relationships.	你渐渐回溯到越来越早， 加上更多的远亲。
But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records, and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.	但是最终，不管你有多么能干，发掘了教堂的记载， 所有的来源，你还是会遇到一个家谱学家所说的碰壁。
A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors, and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.	也就是你实在找不出更多的信息了。 你会陷入历史的迷雾， 只能靠着细小的声音找寻出路。
Who were these people who came before?	这些人是谁？谁先谁后？
We have no written record.	我们没有纸上记载。
Well, actually, we do.	事实上，我们有记录保存下来。
Written in our DNA, in our genetic code -- we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species.	信息都记在我们的DNA里，在我们的基因书中。
And that's what we study.	这就是我们要研究的。
Now, a quick primer on DNA.	现在，简单介绍一下DNA。
I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.	我猜不是每个听众都是遗传学家。
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.	DNA是个非常长的线状物，一个如何复制你自己的密码书， 也是你的蓝图。
It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.	DNA有四个成分组成：A，C，G和T。
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.	这四个成分的组合顺序决定了蓝图，
How long is it?	DNA有多长？
Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.	有上百亿个成分组成。
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.	我们的基因是双份的，我们的染色体有一式两份， 每份基因有三十二亿核酸那么长，
And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long.	如果你把所有的染色体连起来， 就有多于六十亿核酸长。
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.	如果你把你体内一个细胞的DNA拿出来， 头尾相连，大概是两米长。
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body, and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back, thousands of times.	如果你把你体内每一个细胞的DNA都拿出来， 头尾相连，可以从地球到月球再回来， 往返成千上万次。
It's a lot of information.	这里包含了很多的信息。
And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.	当你复制这些DNA时，试图把信息传到下一代时，是个很难的工作。
Imagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."	想象你知道得最长的书，比如战争与和平，
Now multiply it by 100.	乘上一百倍，
And imagine copying that by hand.	然后想象你手抄这些书，
And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake -- substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.	直到深夜， 你非常非常小心，喝咖啡保持清醒， 你注意力高度集中，但是时不时地， 当你手抄的时候， 还是会出错 — 抄错字母。 本来是 I 写成了 E，本来是 C 写成了 T。
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.	这种事情在DNA复制的时候也会发生。
It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.	不常发生，因为我们有查错和纠错的系统，
But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down through the generations, they become markers of descent.	但是一旦发生了，这些改变会传到下一代， 刚好变成了世代相传的标签。
If you share a marker with someone, it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past, the person who first had that change in their DNA.	如果你和别人有一个相同标签， 这说明你们血脉相连。 都能连回到那个第一次产生这个标签的人。
And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation, the pattern of these markers in people all over the world, and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history, that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.	通过观察基因变异的类型， 全世界人们携带的标签的类型， 来分析标签产生的年代， 正是我们用来给每个人创造家谱的方法。
These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.	这里有两个DNA片断，我们用的很多，
Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.	一个是线粒体DNA，总是从母亲那里来，
You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother, all the way back to the very first woman.	你从你妈妈那里得到线粒体DNA，你妈妈从她的妈妈那里得到， 一直追回到第一个人类女性。
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men, traces a purely paternal line of descent.	还有就是Y染色体，雄性染色体， 能够追溯父系信息。
Everybody in this room, everybody in the world, falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.	这屋里的每个人，这世界上的每个人， 都能在这些家谱里找到位置。
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.	现在，即使这些是简化了的家谱， 它们还是很复杂，让我们用更简单的方法看，
Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up.	把它们侧过来，汇总变成一棵树的样子， 下面有根上面有树枝。
What's the take-home message?	到底说明什么？
Well, the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa, among Africans.	你最先注意到的 是最深的世代， 是从非洲来的，非洲人。
That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer.	这说明非洲人集聚了最长时间的 基因变异，
And what that means is that we originated in Africa.	这说明了我们都是从非洲起源的。
It's written in our DNA.	这是写在DNA里的。
Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.	每一个我们研究的DNA片断都在非洲内有更深的多样性。
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.	过去的每个时期，一部分非洲人， 离开了非洲大陆，在世界的其他地方定居了。
Now, how recently do we share this ancestry?	现在的问题是，这发生在多久以前？
Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?	是在几百万年前么？如我们 从全世界这么多不同的人种来猜想的一样?
No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.	不是的。DNA把历史弄得很清楚，
Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person -- Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa, an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.	在过去的二十万年中，我们有共同的祖先，同一个人， 线粒体 Eve — 你可能听说过她 — 在非洲。 这一个非洲女性，就是现今全世界多种多样的线粒体的起源。
But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side, the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago.	更令人惊奇的是， 如果你看 Y 染色体， 男性这边， Y 染色体亚当， 存在于六万年前。
That's only about 2,000 human generations, the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.	从他数来只不过两千代的人类历史。 对于进化史来说，这不过是一眨眼间的事。
That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.	这告诉我们六万年前我们还都生活在非洲，
This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.	一个非洲男性 把 Y 染色体传给了全世界。
It's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.	仅仅是过去的六万年里， 我们人类产生了这个令人难以置信的多样性。
Such an amazing story.	多么令人惊叹。
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.	我们都是这个非洲大家族的一部分。
Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?	看起来这并不是很久以前，为什么我们早没有离开非洲大陆呢？
Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species, or sub-species rather, human races around the world?	为什么直立人没有发展成不同的人种， 或者亚种，而是变成了现在世界上的种族？
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?	为什么我们这么晚才从非洲出来？
Well, that's a big question.	这是个很重要的问题。
These "why" questions, particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones, the ones that are tough to answer.	这些为什么的问题。 尤其是对遗传学和人类史学来说，都一直是很重要的问题。 这些问题很难回答。
And so when all else fails, talk about the weather.	所以我们把注意力转到气候的变化上。
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?	六万年前，世界的气候是什么样的？
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.	那时候是最后一个冰河时期的最糟糕的一个时候。
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.	最后的一个冰河时期始于十二万年前，
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.	开始不稳定，后来在七万年前加速，
Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.	从沉积物， 花粉类型，和氧同位素研究方面有很多证据。
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold.	在一万六千年前我们到达了最后的冰河时代， 但基本上从七万年前开始，气候变得很严酷。
The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.	 变得很冷。北半球全是冰层，
New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.	纽约，芝加哥，西雅图，这些地区全在冰下。
Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.	英国大部分，整个斯堪的那维亚半岛，全被数千米的冰层覆盖。
Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn -- and there aren't a lot of glaciers here, except on the high mountains here in East Africa.	那时，非洲是整个星球上最热带的大陆 — 大约百分之八十五处在巨蟹和摩羯座之间， 也没有什么冰河， 除了在东非的一些高山上。
So what was going on here?	那里发生了什么呢？
We weren't covered in ice in Africa.	我们没有被盖在冰下，
Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.	但是，非洲变得非常干燥。
This is a paleo-climatological map of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago, reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.	这是个古气候图， 显示了七万年前到六万年前非洲的样子， 这是从所有我之前提到的证据拼起来的。
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.	气候干燥的原因是冰层事实上从大气中吸收水分。
If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.	试着想象一下南极洲，简直就是个沙漠，没什么降水。
So the whole world was drying out.	所以当时整个世界都变得干燥了。
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.	海平面下降，非洲变成了沙漠。
The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.	当时的撒哈拉沙漠比现在的大很多，
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today.	人类的居住地变成了很小的一块块， 和我们今天的活动范围相比。
The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago, crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.	遗传学的证据表明， 这时候的人类数量，大约七万年前， 掉到少于两千人。
We nearly went extinct.	我们差一点就灭绝了。
We were hanging on by our fingernails.	我们就差一点点就完了。
And then something happened.	接着分支才发生的。
A great illustration of it.	这里有个很好的图解，
Look at some stone tools.	看到这些石器了么，
The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.	左边的这些是从非洲发掘的，来自大概一百万年前，
The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins, not our direct ancestors, living in Europe, and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.	右边的这些是尼安德特人作的，他们是我们的远祖表亲， 并不是直系祖先，他们生活在欧洲。 他们在五万年六万年前灭绝了。
Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience, basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.	现在，冒着对观众中的 古人类学家以及人类学家不敬的危险， 这两种石器间基本上没什么进化。
The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.	左边的看起来和右边得很像。
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.	我们处在进化休止期，始于一百万年前， 直到七万年前到六万年前左右。
The tool styles don't change that much.	这些工具没有怎么进化。
The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period.	这个证据表明，人类的生活方式 在那段时间没有什么变化。
But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose.	但是五万年，六万年，或者七万年前，非洲的一些地方， 开始产生变化了。
Art makes its appearance.	艺术开始出现，
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.	石器工具做得精细了。
The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species, at particular times of the year.	这些证据说明人类开始在一年中的某个时期， 捕食特定的生物。
The population size started to expand.	人类的数量开始增长，
Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object -- that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.	很有可能，根据很多语言学家所说， 完整的现代语言，句法语言 — 有主语，动词，宾语的 — 就像我现在用来的传达复杂信息的语言，也是这时候开始出现的。
We became much more social. The social networks expanded.	我们变得更社会性了，社交网络开始变大，
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.	这种行为上的进化帮助我们在非洲气候变坏的时候存活下来， 也帮助我们开始迁移到全世界。
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.	在这个会上我们讨论了很多非洲的成功之处，
Well, you want the ultimate African success story?	这里，你想要听一个最基本的非洲成功的故事么？
Look in the mirror.	照照镜子，你就是。
You're it.	今天你能够在这里存活， 是因为那时候在非洲人类脑子里的变化。
The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now, around 60, 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.	 恐怕就发生在我们现在坐的地方， 六万或者七万年前。 这些变化让我们不光是在非洲存活，也迁移到了非洲之外。
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.	早期的海岸线迁移，顺着非洲南海岸， 在六万年前离开非洲大陆， 五万年前抵达了澳洲。
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.	稍晚一点，另一部分人迁移到了中东，
These would have been savannah hunters.	这些是所谓的草原猎手。
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.	你们有谁在开会后作旅行的， 你会看到真正的草原猎手是什么样子的。
And it's basically a meat locker.	他们基本上是嗜肉的，
People who would have specialized in killing the animals, hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up, following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago, during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.	进化成为特级的捕杀动物的人， 这些草原猎人猎杀动物，向北迁移， 在四万五千年前沿着草原进入中东。 那时撒哈拉有一个少见的湿润期。
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands, because that's what they were adapted to live on.	接着他们向东迁移，还是沿着草原， 因为这是适合他们生活的气候，
And when they reached Central Asia, they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway, a grassland super-highway.	接着他们到了亚洲中部 沿着这个草原高速路， 草原高速通道。
The grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age -- stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea, and the entire continent was open to them.	那时的草原，还是最后的冰河时期， 从德国一直延伸到韩国， 整个亚洲大陆都是草原。
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago, and finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age -- temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps -- migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.	人类在三万五千年前进入欧洲， 最后，一小部分跨越最严酷的气候， 来到了西伯利亚， 进入北极圈，还是在最后的冰河时期。 这时候气温是大约负七十华氏，或者负八十，甚至负一百。 他们到了美洲，基本上是最后的前沿。
An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.	这个是很动人的故事，最先起源是非洲。
The changes that allowed us to do that, the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures, allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.	这些变化给了我们机会， 进化出这个高度适应性的大脑，我们能带着走， 使我们有机会创造新的文化， 使我们有机会变得多种多样， 就像我在之前的旅行中看到的一样。
Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.	我给你讲的这个人类进化的故事，就像一个旋风式的旅行 一个人类如何迁移到整个世界的旅行，旧石器时代的奇迹。
And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.	这也是我在几年前 发表的书中讲的故事。人类的旅程，以及我们制作的同名电影中讲的故事。
And as we were finishing up that film -- it was co-produced with National Geographic -- I started talking to the folks at NG about this work.	当我们完成这部电影的时候 — 这部电影是和国家地理杂志合作的 — 我开始和国家地理杂志的同事们谈起我的研究。
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, "You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.	他们觉得很激动，他们喜欢这部电影，但是他们问： 你知道，我们真的觉得 这时研究人类起源，研究我们从哪里来的的新潮流。 用这些DNA工具来做一个人类迁移的地图。
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA, and we want to take it to the next level.	既然这个人类起源的研究都在我们的DNA中， 我们想进一步做这个故事。
What do you want to do next?"	你下一步的计划是什么？
Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.	国家地理杂志问了个很好的问题。
And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.	我说，你知道，我画的这个图只是
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.	我们只研究了几个基因标记，这个地图上还有很多的间隙。
We've just connected the dots.	我们只是连起了几个点而已。
What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more -- hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."	我们现在要做的， 是增加我们采样的人数，至少十倍， 我们需要成千上万世界各地的人的DNA样本。
And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.	这才是刚刚是基因地理学的开始。
The project launched in April 2005.	这个项目始于2005年四月，
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.	包括三个核心项目，当然科学方面是一个。
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.	另一个是实地考察，我们和世界各地的土著们做的
People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost.	所谓土著是指在同一个地方生活了很长时间的人， 我们能够通过他们生活的地方建立地图的联系， 这是在我们大多数人身上做不到的。
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.	比如我的祖先是从欧洲各地来的，
I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.	我本人定居在北美东海岸，
Where am I indigenous to?	我的家乡是哪里呢？
Nowhere really.	哪儿也不是。
My genes are all jumbled up.	我的基因在地图上跳来跳去地混乱了。
But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.	但是有的土著们还能够追随到很远的祖先， 这给我们提供了机会把DNA结果联系起来。
That's the focus of the field research, the centers that we've set up all over the world -- 10 of them, top population geneticists.	这就是这个研究项目的重点。 我们在世界各地设了点， 十个点，都是顶尖的遗传学家。
But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.	更进一步，我们希望把这个科学研究向全世界所有人开放。
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?	你多久一次能有机会参加一个大型科研项目？
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.	就像是人类基因组计划，或者火星探索？
In this case, you actually can.	这次你有机会了。
You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.	你可以上我们的网站，Nationalgeographic.com/genographic
You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.	定一个匣子，用里面的东西你能测试自己的DNA。
And you can actually submit those results to the database, and tell us a little about your genealogical background, have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.	你还能把结果提交给我们的数据库， 再告诉我们一些你的家庭历史 我们就会分析你的DNA数据，当作是这个科研的一部分。
Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise, after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components, gets plowed back into the project.	这都不是为了赚钱的。所有的所得， 除去我们做测试和准备这个匣子的费用， 都用来支持这个计划。
The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.	大部分会用来当作保留费用，
It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.	这是用来做慈善事业的钱，本质上是一个给出经费的机构， 把钱给世界各地的土著们， 用来发展教育，文化。
They apply to this fund in order to do various projects, and I'll show you a couple of examples.	他们订计划我们经费支持，他们把经费用在各种项目上。 让我给你们几个例子。
So how are we doing on the project?	现在这个项目在做什么呢？
We've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world.	我们已经得到了两万五千个样本， 从全世界各地的人种上得到的。
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago, which has raised around five million dollars, the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.	最令人惊奇的公众的兴趣。 两年来二十一万人 购买了我们的匣子。 我们赚了五百万。 绝大部分的钱，回流注入了这个保留基金。
We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.	我们刚刚给了第一个基金会五十万。
Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone, preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza, language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.	用于全球范围的文化项目，比如在塞拉利昂记录保存口头流传的诗歌， 在加沙保存传统的编织式样， 在塔克亚复兴当地语言，等等，等等。
So the project is going very, very well, and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.	这个项目进行得非常非常顺利。 而我在这里，鼓励大家都去访问我们的网页，关注我们的进展。
Thank you very much.	谢谢大家。
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade, and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own.	我已在TED演奏了将近十年， 可是我几乎很少 演奏自己的新歌。
And that was largely because there weren't any.	主要原因是，根本就没有。
So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg.	我一直在忙于几个项目， 其中一个， 叫做肉豆蔻（植物名）--
A 1930s ship's lifeboat, which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England.	一艘20世纪30年代的救生艇。 我把它停放在我那英格兰的海滩别墅 一个后花园里。
And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.	要是现在 北极的冰川融化， 我的这艘录音室就会浮起来有如诺亚方舟， 在这个淹没的世界里漂向远方， 就像英国作家J·G·巴拉德小说里的角色一样。
During the day, the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse, and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast.	白天， 肉豆蔻可以通过舵手室里的太阳能电池板， 收集太阳能， 和桅杆上一个 450瓦特的涡轮机。
So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power.	那么当夜幕降临， 我就有足够的电力照明，
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.	点亮照明灯，在黑暗中仿佛灯塔。
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs.	我便待在里面创作直到天明。 我已经完成几首新歌，
I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.	如果你们愿意成为第一批听众， 我将非常乐意演奏。
It's about Billie Holiday.	（鼓掌） 是关于比利霍利迪的。
And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning.	当时有传说， 1974年的某个夜晚， 她离开那个时空， 消失了一整晚， 直到第二天早晨又再度出现。
But I know where she was.	不过我知道她去了哪里，
She was with me on my lifeboat.	其实她和我一起在这艘方舟，
And she was hot.	她很火辣。
Billie crept softly into my waking arms warm like a sip of sour mash Strange fruit for a sweet hunk of trash Panic at the stage door of Carnegie Hall "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" Must have left the building body and soul On a creaky piano stool tonight as the moon is my only witness She was breathing in my ear "This time it's love" But love is a loaded pistol By daybreak she's gone Over the frozen river, home Me and Johnny Walker See in the new age alone Stay with me again tonight Billie, time, time is a wily trickster Still an echo in my heart says, "This time it's love"	比利温柔地躺进 醒来后我的臂弯 温暖得好似一口波本威士忌 怪诞却成效十足 温柔却总犯傻的她 慌乱在舞台前的走廊口 卡内基大厅 名爵士歌唱者，擅离职守 定是离开了大楼 身心并去，毫不愧疚 今夜躲藏在已老朽的 钢琴凳旁 因为月亮是我的唯一的见证 唯一的见证 她轻轻 呼吸在我耳旁 此时此刻，就是爱吧 可是，爱好似上膛的枪 天明她就要离开 去到冰冷的河岸，她的家 剩下我和我的酒 相伴于未来的日子 孤单孑然 留下吧 今夜再留下吧 比利，你知道吗 时间是多么奸诈的诡计家 让那个回忆不断回响 它在我心里轻声说 这次，是爱吧
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.	我基本上比较关心世界上所发生的事情。
I couldn't understand the starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people.	我不明白 那些饥饿、破坏 以及对无辜人们的杀戮
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do.	搞清楚这些 真是一件很难的事情
And when I was 12, I became an actor.	12岁的时候，我成为了一个演员。
I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.	我处于社会的最底层，没有任何资历。
I was told I was dyslexic.	别人说我有诵读困难症。
In fact, I have got qualifications.	事实上，我也是有证书的。
I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get -- which was useful, obviously.	我在制作陶器上拿到了D，这的确是我得到的一个证书。 显然，这是有用的。
And so concern is where all of this comes from.	所以焦虑 是所有这些的来源。
And then, being an actor, I was doing these different kinds of things, and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in really wasn't cutting it, that there surely had to be more.	作为一个演员，我一直在做着这些不同的事情。 我觉得我参与的这些工作 并没有让这种焦虑减少，而且我会越来越焦虑。
And at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby, this wonderful nuclear physicist, and he said that media had a responsibility, that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward.	在那个时候，我读了弗兰克·巴纳的一本书。 他是一个伟大的核物理学家。 他认为媒体有责任、 社会的各个部门都有责任 去尝试并推动事情的发展。
And that fascinated me, because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life.	这使我着迷， 因为我大部分时间都一直拿着摄像机到处闲混。
And then I thought, well maybe I could do something.	于是我想，或许我可以做点什么。
Maybe I could become a filmmaker.	没准我可以成为一个电影制片人。
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference.	没准我可以积极地使用电影的形式 来对某一方面做出改变。
Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in.	或许有一些我可以参与的变革。
So I started thinking about peace, and I was obviously, as I said to you, very much moved by these images, trying to make sense of that.	于是我开始思考和平， 就像我跟你们所说的，我显然 被这些图片深深感动了， 并试着去找出它们的意义。
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on?	我能去问一些年纪更大或者更明智的人 他们会告诉我他们如何搞明白 正在发生的这些事情么？
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.	这显然是非常可怕的
But I realized that, having been messing around with structure as an actor, that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough, that there needed to be a mountain to climb, there needed to be a journey that I had to take.	但是， 作为一个演员，跟着摄影组四处闲混， 我明白一系列简短的采访本身根本不够， 而是需要一座山来供攀登， 需要一段我必须踏上的旅程。
And if I took that journey, no matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.	如果我踏上了那段旅程， 不管它是失败还是成功，都完全无所谓了。
The point was that I would have something to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil?	关键是我可以有资本 提出这个问题——人们本质上是邪恶的么？
Is the destruction of the world inevitable?	世界的毁灭是不可避免的？
Should I have children?	我应该有孩子么？
Is that a responsible thing to do?	那是一个关乎责任的事情么？
Etc., etc.	等等。
So I was thinking about peace, and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?	所以我思考和平的问题， 然后我想，和平的起点在哪里呢？
And that was when I had the idea.	就在那时我有了这个想法，
There was no starting point for peace.	和平没有起点。
There was no day of global unity.	没有全球团结的一天。
There was no day of intercultural cooperation.	没有跨文化合作的一天。
There was no day when humanity came together, separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we're in this together, and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated, then that might be the key to humanity's survival.	没有一天人类可以聚到一起， 远离饥饿、破坏等所有的那些事情， 仅仅分享这一天， 我们在一起的这一天， 如果我们团结起来，并且不同文化合作起来， 或许就是人类生存的钥匙。
That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day.	或许这能改变人类面对基本问题时 产生觉悟的层次 只需我们这样做一天。
So obviously we didn't have any money.	很明显我们没有钱，
I was living at my mom's place.	我住在我妈妈家里，
And we started writing letters to everybody.	我们开始给每个人写信，
You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do to fathom that out.	你很快就能想出你需要做的事情 并将它搞明白。
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day, the 21st of September?	你如何创造一个由世界各国首脑投票选出的一天？ 创造出史上第一个无战火、无暴力的一天， 9月21日？
And I wanted it to be the 21st of September because it was my granddad's favorite number.	我把这一天定在9月21日， 是因为这是我爷爷最喜欢的数字。
He was a prisoner of war.	他曾是战争的俘虏，
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.	他看到原子弹在长崎爆炸。
It poisoned his blood.	毒气污染了他的血液。
He died when I was 11.	他在我11岁的时候去世了。
So he was like my hero.	他就像我的英雄。
And the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left, 23 came back, two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground.	至于说为什么选21这个数字， 当时他们700个人去参加战争，23个回来了， 两个死在了船上，21个着陆了。
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace.	这就是为什么我们想把9月21日做为这一天。
So we began this journey, and we launched it in 1999.	于是我们开始这个旅程， 我们在1999年发起这个活动，
And we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors, Nobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths, various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody.	写信给各国首脑、大使们、 诺贝尔和平奖获得者、非政府组织、宗教机构、 各种各样的机构——几乎给所有人都写过了。
And very quickly, some letters started coming back.	很快，一些信件得到了回复。
And we started to build this case.	于是我们开始建立这个项目。
And I remember the first letter.	我记得第一封信。
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.	第一批信中有一封是来自达赖喇嘛。
And of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail].	当然我们没有钱，我们弹吉他 来赚钱以买到寄出这些信件需要的邮票钱。
A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying, "This is an amazing thing. Come and see me.	达赖喇嘛的回信说道， 这是一个有趣的事情，来见我。
I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace."	我想跟你聊聊有史以来的第一个和平的一天。

Could you give me a flight?	你能给我们提供机票么？
Because we're going to go see him."	因为我们要去见他。
And of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing.	当然，后来我们见到了达赖喇嘛，的确很有趣。
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward.	然后奥斯卡·阿里亚斯主动跟我们联系。
And actually, let me go back to that slide, because when we launched it in 1999 -- this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence -- we invited thousands of people.	实际上，让我先回到那张幻灯片， 当我们在1999年发起这个活动—— 创造史上第一个无战火、无暴力的一天的时候， 我们邀请了成千上万的人。
Well not thousands -- hundreds of people, lots of people -- all the press, because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day, a peace day.	嗯不是成千上万——成百上千的人，许多人—— 所有的媒体，因为我们将尝试去创造 史上第一个世界和平日，一个和平的一天。
And we invited everybody, and no press showed up.	我们邀请了所有人， 但是没有任何媒体到场。
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family.	只有114个人出现，他们大部分都是我的朋友和家人。
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing.	这件事情的发起大概就是这样。
But it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing.	但是这没有关系，因为我们在记录，这才是关键。
For me, it was really about the process.	对我来说，真正重要的是过程，
It wasn't about the end result.	而不是最后的结果。
And that's the beautiful thing about the camera.	这就是摄像机的魅力所在。
They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword.	人们通常说笔比剑更有分量。
I think the camera is.	我想摄像机也是。
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually.	还是说到摄像机很有魅力， 并且的确很强大。
So anyway, we began the journey.	无论如何，我们开始这个旅程了，
And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.	这里你可以看到玛丽·鲁滨逊这样的人，我当时去日内瓦看她。
I'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long, because every time I saw Kofi Annan, I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it, and that was kind of what was going on.	我打算去剪剪我的头发，它变得长短不一。 因为每次我看到科菲·安南， 我都担心他会认为我是一个嬉皮士，所以我把它剪了。 那就是我当时在做的事情。
Yeah, I'm not worried about it now.	恩，所以我现在不用担心头发了。
So Mary Robinson, she said to me, "Listen, this is an idea whose time has come.	说到玛丽·鲁滨逊， 她跟我说，这个想法的时机已经成熟了，它必须被实现。
This must be created."	
Kofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground."	科菲·安南说，这将对我的地面部队很有帮助。
The OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim, said, "I must get the African countries involved."	那时的非洲统一组织由萨利姆，艾哈迈德·萨利姆领导， 他说，我必须让非洲国家参与进来。
Dr. Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace laureate, president now of Costa Rica, said, "I'll do everything that I can."	奥斯卡·阿里亚斯博士，诺贝尔和平奖获得者， 现在是哥斯达黎加的总统。 他说，我将做我可以做的一切。
So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States.	所以我去见到了阿拉伯联盟秘书长穆萨，
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks, and so on and so on and so on -- while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense.	我在阿鲁沙的和平谈判中见到了曼德拉， 等等，等等...... 同时我也一直在创立这个项目， 来判断这个想法 是否有意义。
And then we were listening to the people.	我们一直在听那些人讲各种各样的故事。
We were documenting everywhere.	我们到处记录。
76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.	过去12年我参观了76个国家。

I've recorded 44,000 young people.	我已经采访了了44,000位年轻人，
I've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.	记录了900小时关于他们的想法的视频。
I'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry, their art, their literature, their music, their sport, whatever it might be.	我真的非常了解 当你和他们谈到这个想法， 为他们建立更加和平的世界提供起点，这些年轻人是怎么想的 通过他们的诗歌、艺术、文学、 他们的音乐、运动，或者无论其他什么。

And it was an incredibly thing, working with the U.N.	这的确是一个不可思议的事情，与联合国合作
and working with NGOs and building this case.	与非政府组织合作，建立这个项目。
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day.	我觉得我在呈现一个项目， 代表全球社区 来尝试建立这一天。
And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was, the better chance we had of creating this day.	这个项目越强大、越详细 我们创造这一天的机会就越多。
And it was this stuff, this, where I actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter.	就是这些，这些 实际上就是我最开始在的地方 我想无论发生什么，实际上都没关系
It didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace.	如果它没有创造出和平的一天也没关系。
The fact is that, if I tried and it didn't work, then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite -- until, it was in Somalia, picking up that young girl.	事实是，如果我尝试过但没有成功， 那我就可以做一个声明 关于这个全球社区是多么不想团结起来 直到我在索马里偶然遇到那个小女孩。
And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic, and that young boy who was a child soldier, who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop.	这个小孩， 在没有消毒的情况下从她的腿上取出一个一英尺半的子弹 那个小男孩是一个童子军， 他告诉我他已经杀过人了——他大约12岁 这些事情使我意识到 这并不是一个我可以随时终止的电影

And so I went back to London, and I went and saw this chap, Jude Law.	但是即使它不成功，至少打开了一扇门， 于是就有了机会

One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world, and I do that quite regularly.	在盖茨基金会工作， 我最喜欢的部分 就是有机会去到发展中国家。 我经常去那些国家。
And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places, I'm really struck by the things that we have in common.	当我去到那些偏远的地方 见到那里做了母亲的妇女们， 我着实被我们的共同之处 所深深感动。
They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful, to be healthy, and to have a successful life.	对待孩子，她们和我们一样 望子成龙，望女成风， 希望他们健健康康，顺顺利利。
But I also see lots of poverty, and it's quite jarring, both in the scale and the scope of it.	我还看到了许多贫困的地方， 不管是贫困的程度或范围， 都让人触目惊心。
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors, no running water, no electricity, and that's really what I see all over the world.	第一次去印度时，我去到一个人家里， 他家里的地面就是黄土地，没有自来水， 没有通电， 这样的情况我在世界各地都见到过。
So in short, I'm startled by all the things that they don't have.	简单点说，看到他们连这些基本的生活条件都没有 我感到非常吃惊。
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have: Coca-Cola.	但是，让我纳闷的是他们居然都拥有： 可口可乐。
Coke is everywhere.	可口可乐无处不在。
In fact, when I travel to the developing world, Coke feels ubiquitous.	我在发展中国家的时候， 随处都能看到可口可乐。
And so when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development, and I'm flying home and I'm thinking, "We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations," you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder: how is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places?	于是，我从这些旅行回来之后， 我就在思考发展的问题， 坐在回家的飞机上，我就一边在思考， 我们在想方设法普及安全套和各种疫苗， 可口可乐的成功让你不得不停下来思考： 他们是怎么把可乐 送到这些穷乡僻壤的？
If they can do that, why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?	如果他们能做到， 政府以及非政府组织岂不是也能做到吗？
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.	这个问题不是我首先提出的。
But I think, as a community, we still have a lot to learn.	但是我想，作为一个协同合作的团体， 有许多事情是值得我们学习的。
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.	谈到可口可乐，他们可真是不得了。
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day.	他们每天能售出 十五亿瓶可乐。
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week.	这就相当于，地球上的每一个男人，女人，和孩子， 每周都喝掉一瓶可乐。
So why does this matter?	这当中有什么启示呢？
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector.	如果我们想加快 甚至缩短 我们千年发展目标的进程， 那么我们就要向实业家们学习了， 这些实业家们 来自各行各业。
I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.	我觉得，如果我们能悟出 可口可乐之所以无处不在的原因， 我们就能够把其中奥妙运用在公共服务上。
Coke's success is relevant, because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives.	可口可乐的成功是值得借鉴的， 因为我们可以分析它，从中得到启发， 然后用它来拯救生命。
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.	就这样，我花了一点时间来研究可口可乐。
And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca-Cola.	我认为我们能从可口可乐身上 学到三样东西。
They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product.	他们对销售数据进行实时监控 并立即汇报产品的销售情况。
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent, and they do incredible marketing.	他们扶持地方企业人才， 他们的市场营销做得天衣无缝。
So let's start with the data.	我们先看一下他们的数据管理。
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.	可口可乐有一条非常明确的底线。 他们向一群股东汇报情况。他们必须保证利润。
So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress.	那么他们就要实时监控数据， 他们根据时实数据测量进度，
They have this very continuous feedback loop.	他们持续进行情况汇报。
They learn something, they put it back into the product, they put it back into the market.	当他们得到有用信息，他们立即对产品进行调整， 进而调整市场策略。
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."	他们有一支团队，叫做知识与远见。
It's a lot like other consumer companies.	它很像其它以顾客为导向的公司。
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola, and you have a 107 constituencies, you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold, whether it was a corner store, a supermarket or a pushcart.	假设你是可口可乐在纳米比亚的负责人， 你在当地有107个选区， 每售出一瓶或一罐雪碧，芬达或可乐， 你都知道是从哪里出售的， 不管是在街角的杂货店， 某家超市或者某个手推车上。
So if sales start to drop, then the person can identify the problem and address the issue.	如果销售量下降， 那么负责人就会查出问题 并解决问题。
Let's contrast that for a minute to development.	我们看一下这和发展有什么异同。
In development, the evaluation comes at the very end of the project.	发展过程中所取得的价值 要到最后才能看出高低。
I've sat in a lot of those meetings, and by then, it is way too late to use the data.	我参加过很多相关的会议， 当时， 使用数据的时效早已过期。
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.	我曾碰到一位非政府组织的工作人员， 他对我说，这就像是在黑暗里打保龄球，
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.	有人说：把球滚出去，接着球瓶应声倒下。
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on, and then you an see your impact."	四周很暗，只有开灯以后，你才能看见哪支瓶子倒下， 然后你才知道自己的成绩。
Real-time data turns on the lights.	实时数据 就能把灯打开。
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?	那么可口可乐第二个成功的秘诀是什么呢？
They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent.	他们善于扶植 当地企业人才。
Coke's been in Africa since 1928, but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets, because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world, which was a large truck rolling down the street.	可口可乐1928年开始在非洲发展， 但是，长期以来，他们都没有成功进入偏远地区的市场， 原因是他们的运营体系基本上还是很像他们在发达国家所采用的体系， 就是把大卡车开到大街上成批地运送。
And in Africa, the remote places, it's hard to find a good road.	而在非洲的偏远地区， 连一条像样点的路都很难找到。
But Coke noticed something -- they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.	但是，可口可乐注意到了一点。 他们发现当地人会成批购买某种商品， 然后把这些商品分销到偏远地区。
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.	他们花了一点时间来研究这个情况。
And they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs, giving them small loans.	于是他们在1990年决定 开始栽培当地的创业者， 给他们提供小额贷款。
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers, and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people, who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product.	他们把这些人分组，称之为微型分销中心。 这些当地创业者接着自主聘请销售人员， 让他们骑着自行车，推着贩卖车 到处叫卖。
There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa.	目前这样的分销中心数量已经达到3000多个 在非洲的雇员人数在15000人左右。
In Tanzania and Uganda, they represent 90 percent of Coke's sales.	可口可乐在坦桑尼亚和乌干达的销量 占他们在非洲总销量的 百分之九十。
Let's look at the development side.	我们现在从发展的角度来看看。
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke?	政府和非政府组织 能够从可口可乐哪里学到什么？
Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well, because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors, and they know what motivates them to make change.	政府和非政府组织 也需要扶植地方上的企业人才， 因为当地人知道如何打入 那些偏远地区的市场，接近他们的邻居， 他们知道如何有效解决问题。
I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program.	这里有一个很好的例子， 埃塞俄比亚的医疗普及计划。
The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic, they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.	埃塞俄比亚政府注意到 该国许多人的住所离健康诊所很远， 他们必须走一天的路才能找到一间诊所。
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it, to get to the health care center.	如果你发生了什么意外，或者你是个临产的孕妇， 就别动去健康中心的念头了，
They decided that wasn't good enough, so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this, and they adapted it for Ethiopia.	该国政府决定改善这种情况， 他们派人去印度喀拉拉邦 学习那里的医疗体系， 他们改良并在埃塞俄比亚推行这种体系。
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country.	2003年，埃塞俄比亚政府 开始推行这套新医疗体系。
They trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people.	他们对35000位医务人员进行培训， 让他们直接给人们提供医疗服务。
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people.	在短短五年里， 原本每30000人仅有一位医务人员的情况， 变为每2500人有一位医务人员。
Now, think about how this can change people's lives.	想想吧， 这对人们的生活是多大的改变啊。
Health extension workers can help with so many things, whether it's family planning, prenatal care, immunizations for the children, or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery.	这些医务人员的贡献巨大， 计划生育，产前护理， 儿童疾病防疫， 劝告产妇及时到医院 以免耽误生产。
That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia, and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008.	对埃塞俄比亚这样的国家而言， 这具有极其深远的影响。 它使得2000年到2008年 该国婴儿死亡率 降低了百分之二十五。
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program.	在埃塞俄比亚，全靠这些医务人员 才使得成百上千的儿童得以存活。
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?	那么埃塞俄比亚接下来的工作是什么呢？
Well, they're already starting talk about this.	他们现在已经开始商量这事了。
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas?	他们在商量：如何才能让社区卫生工作人员 更有主见呢？
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages?"	如何让他们了解他们为那些偏远村庄所做出的贡献， 进而激励他们呢？
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential.	你就该这样培养地方创业人才， 发掘人们的潜力。
The third component of Coke's success is marketing.	可口可乐获得成功的第三个秘诀 是市场营销战略。
Ultimately, Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca-Cola.	可口可乐的成功 最终取决于一个不争的事实， 那就是，人人都想喝 可口可乐。
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.	而这些个体企业家 如果想赚到钱 他们就必须卖出手推贩卖车中的每一瓶可乐。
So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing?	他们的市场营销战略 紧紧围绕着可口可乐这个产品。 那么他们市场营销战略的成功秘诀何在呢？
Well, it's aspirational.	这个秘诀就是主动出击。
It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live.	它把产品 与人们所追求的生活联系起来。
So even though it's a global company, they take a very local approach.	尽管它是个跨国公司， 可口可乐采取的是因地制宜的策略。
Coke's global campaign slogan is "Open Happiness."	他们在全球的宣传标语是 畅爽开怀。
But they localize it.	他们让它更具地方色彩。
And they don't just guess what makes people happy; they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life.	他们不是凭空猜测什么能让人幸福开怀， 而是亲身去到拉丁美洲等地， 他们了解到，在那里， 幸福来自家庭生活。
And in South Africa, they associate happiness with seriti or community respect.	在南非， 幸福 来自对社区的尊重。
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.	这点在世界杯宣传期间得到了充分证明。
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, "Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.	我们来听一听这首由可口可乐公司创作的歌曲， 这首歌叫《旗帜飞扬》，由来自索马里的嘻哈歌手演唱。
K'Naan: Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Give you freedom, give you fire Give you reason, take you higher See the champions take the field now You define us, make us feel proud In the streets our heads are lifted As we lose our inhibition Celebration, it's around us Every nation, all around us Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?	KNaan演唱：噢，噢，噢，噢，噢，噢 噢，噢，噢，噢，噢，噢 噢，噢，噢，噢，噢，噢 噢，噢，噢，噢，噢，噢，噢，噢 给你自由，热情似火 给你理由，激情飞扬 看冠军们激战球场 你赋予我们意义, 让我们倍感自豪 大街小巷，我们抬头仰望 不再压抑 普天同庆 天下一家，普天同庆 美琳达. 法兰奇. 盖茨：感觉不错，对吧？
Well, they didn't stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages.	他们不仅灌录了这一个版本， 他们这首歌翻译成了18种语言。
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries.	它在十七个国家的流行歌曲排行榜上 取得冠军。
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," that also went number one on the pop charts.	它让我想起了小时候听到的一首歌 《我想教全世界唱歌》。 这首歌也曾是冠军单曲。
Both songs have something in common: that same appeal of celebration and unity.	这两首歌有个共同点： 它们都提倡 欢庆与团结。
So how does health and development market?	那么，卫生与发展是如何进行市场营销呢？
Well, it's based on avoidance, not aspirations.	它们总是被动地躲避， 而不是主动出击。
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.	我肯定你们都听过这些口号：
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."	使用安全套，远离艾滋病。
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."	勤洗手，防痢疾。
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.	这些口号听起来一点也不像《旗帜飞扬》。
And I think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption, that we think that, if people need something, we don't have to make them want that.	我认为我们犯了一个根本性错误， 我们一厢情愿地认为 人们用不着别人告诉他们， 什么才是他们需要的。
And I think that's a mistake.	我觉得这个想法不正确。
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.	现在在全球范围内，这个情况似乎有所改变。
One example is sanitation.	公共卫生就是一个例子。
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation.	我们知道每年全球大约有150万儿童 死于痢疾， 而造成这种情况的原因主要是人们随地大小便。
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.	解决方法很简单：建个厕所。
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used.	但是我们在世界各地总是看到： 人们建好一个厕所，放在那里， 却没有人来使用。
People reuse it for a slab for their home.	一些人用它来做杂物房。
They sometimes store grain in it.	他们有时候用它来储藏粮食。
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.	我还见过有人用它来做鸡笼呢。
But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?	（众人笑） 那么我们如何利用市场营销 让人们学会注重公共卫生，进而消灭痢疾呢？
Well, you work with the community.	你必须发挥社区的力量。
You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village, and they agree to that.	你要跟他们讲，他们不应该 在村子里随地大小便。 他们也同意这一点。
One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship.	取得了非常好的效果。
And it works -- look at these headlines.	请看这些标题。
I'm not kidding.	（众人笑） 我可没开玩笑。
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.	妇女们不嫁家里没安厕所的男人。
No loo, no "I do."	没厕所，不过门。
Now, it's not just a funny headline -- it's innovative.	（众人笑） 这可不是一条搞恶搞标题啊。 它是非常有创意的。
It's an innovative marketing campaign.	一次有创意的营销宣传。
But more importantly, it saves lives.	但更重要的是， 它拯救了生命。
Take a look at this -- this is a room full of young men and my husband, Bill.	看看这里。 这间屋里做满了年轻小伙子， 还有我先生比尔。
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?	大家猜猜这些小伙子在等候什么？
They're waiting to be circumcised.	他们正等候着做包皮切除手术。
Can you you believe that?	你们能相信吗？
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men.	我们知道包皮切除手术能够降低男性艾滋病病毒的感染率， 降幅可达百分之六十。
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation, I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"	当我们第一次在基金会听到这个结果时， 我必须承认，我和比尔都有点摸不着头脑， 我们问：但是，谁会主动提出做这个手术呢？
But it turns out the men do, because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it, and the men also believe it improves their sex life.	结果我们发现，男人们是愿意做手术的， 因为他们的女友 希望他们做这个手术。 他们也相信这可以提高性生活的质量。
So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development, we can change communities and we can change whole nations.	由此可见，如果我们开始了解 在卫生和发展方面 什么才是人们真正想要的， 那么我们就能改变一个社区， 甚至改变一个国家。
Well, why is all of this so important?	那为什么这一切那么重要呢？
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together, when you tie the three things together.	我们想想, 要是把三者成功地结合起来， 会出现什么情况？
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.	我想，小儿麻痹症是最有力的例子之一。
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.	在二十年间，小儿麻痹症病例总数下降了99％。
So if you look back to 1988, there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year.	1988年， 全球的小儿麻痹症病例 约有三十五万例。
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.	而到了2009年，这个数字将到了1600例。
Well how did that happen?	是什么导致了这样的变化呢？
Let's look at a country like India.	我们以印度为例。
They have over a billion people in this country, but they have 35,000 local doctors who report paralysis, and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.	这个国家的人口超过十亿， 但是他们在各地有三万五千名医生 他们会报告瘫痪情况， 和临床医师，一个由药剂师组成的庞大病情通报体系。
They have two and a half million vaccinators.	另外他们还有二百五十万名疫苗接种人员。
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.	我再给大家讲一个更具体的例子。
Let me tell you the story of Shriram, an 18 month boy in Bihar, a northern state in India.	我跟大家讲史里拉姆的故事。 他是出生在印度北部的比哈尔省的 一个十八个月大的小男孩。
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.	今年8月18号，他开始感到身体出现麻痹， 13号的时候，他的父母带他去看医生。
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample, and by the 25th of August, it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.	8月14号和15号，他们采集了他的大便样本， 到了8月25号， 他被确诊为第一型小儿麻痹症。
By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.	到了8月30号，医生为他做了基因测试， 现在我们知道了他得的是哪种小儿麻痹病毒株。
Now it could have come from one of two places.	这种病毒株可能来自一下两个地方。
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.	一个是印度国界以北的尼泊尔， 一个是印度南部的恰尔肯德邦。
Luckily, the genetic testing proved that, in fact, this strand came north, because, had it come from the south, it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.	所幸的是，基因测试证明了 这个病毒株是从北部来的， 因为如果是从南方来的， 那么它的传播范围会更广。
So many more people would have been affected.	更多人会受到感染。
So what's the endgame?	事情发展到最后，出现了什么情况呢？
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign, which is what you do in polio.	到了9月14号，一场大扫荡开始了。 这是对付小儿麻痹症的常规手段。
They went out and where Shriram lives, they vaccinated two million people.	他们去到史里拉姆住的地方， 给两百万人注射了疫苗。
So in less than a month, we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program.	就这样，在短短不到一个月的时间里， 一例麻痹病例 发展成了一整套针对性疫苗注射行动。
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.	我很开心地告诉大家，在那个地区，只有一人患上了小儿麻痹。
That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading, and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands; they can save lives.	只有这样 你才能阻止疾病的大规模传播， 这也表明了 当人们及时掌握了确切数据， 他们就能够拯救生命。
Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing, but it might not be what you think.	对付小儿麻痹症的挑战之一，仍然是市场， 但是，它跟你想像的可能不一样。
It's not the marketing on the ground.	它跟通常意义上的市场营销有区别。
It's not telling the parents, "If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated."	它并不是在告诫家长们： 如果你们发现麻痹症状，马上带孩子看医生 或者给孩子注射疫苗。
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.	我们的问题在于如何在捐助者中做市场。
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years, but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer.	八国集团在过去20年内，慷慨地捐出了巨资， 用于治疗小儿麻痹症。 然而现在，人们开始对小儿麻痹症的捐助捐助工作感到疲乏， 也就是说，那些捐助国 不再热衷于出钱资助小儿麻痹症的治疗。
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.	这样，到了明年夏天，治疗这个病的经费就所剩无几了。
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money.	现在地球上患小儿麻痹症的人数 已经降低了百分之九十九， 但是到了这一步，我们的钱也快花完了。
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational, if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease, we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us.	我认为如果这个市场情况更加理想， 如果我们联手把重点 放在我们的成果 以及根除这个疾病将会 多么大快人心， 这样，我们就能摆脱麻痹疲乏， 彻底消灭小儿麻痹症。
And if we could do that, we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide, in all of our countries for polio.	如果我们成功了， 我们就不用再给世界各国的每一个人 注射疫苗了。
And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet.	小儿麻痹症也就成为了第二个 从地球上彻底消失的疾病。
And we are so close.	我们就差这么一步了。
And this victory is so possible.	成功指日可待。
So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness, I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms.	如果可口可乐的营销人员来问我， 幸福是什么， 我会说，在我看来， 幸福就是母亲把自己健康的孩子 紧紧抱在怀里的那一刻。
To me, that is deep happiness.	对于我而言，这是种由衷的幸福。
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector, then in the future we make together, that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca-Cola.	如果我们能够向各行各业的实业家们学习， 那么将来我们就能共同创造出 这样一种 无处不在的幸福， 就像可口可乐一样。
Thank you.	谢谢大家。
The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere in an echo-free chamber.	全息投影球。是在一个无回声的隔间里 的三层的金属球。

Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.	来启发我们在圣巴巴拉所创造的这个新仪器 有什么新的用法。
Thank you very much.	十分感谢。
I essentially drag sledges for a living, so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually, but I'm going to read this question from an interview earlier this year: "Philosophically, does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving?	基本可以说 我是靠拉雪橇来谋生的 所以 拼智力的话真的不用花很大力气就能赢我 不过 我还是会读一下这个问题 这是今年早些时候一个采访中的问题： 从哲学的角度来说 源源不断的资讯 是否偷走了我们想象的能力 或是取代了我们的成功梦？
After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone, and we can participate virtually, then why bother leaving the house?"	毕竟 如果某人在某地不论做什么事情 我们都能感同身受地参与的话 那么干嘛还要那么麻烦离开家呢?
I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.	人们通常介绍我是一名极地探险家。
I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle, so I get out of the house a fair bit.	我不确定极地探险家是否是21世纪最激进的一个职位 但是我一生中有超过2%的时间 都是在北极圈内的一个帐篷里度过的 所以可以说 我离家颇久。
And in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things, and it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action that I'm going to try and explore briefly.	我想我的个性是属于实干派 我不能算是旁观者或沉思者一类的 我想简单和大家探讨一下的正是这种分歧 这种想法和行动之间不可逾越的鸿沟。
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt. Everest.	1924年，他消失在 珠穆朗玛峰峰顶一片云雾中，从此踪迹全无。
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest, more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.	不知道他是不是第一位攀登珠穆朗玛峰的人 比埃德蒙·希拉里早30多年。
No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery.	没有人知道他是否到达山顶 这仍旧是个迷
But he was credited with coining the phrase, "Because it's there."	他人们总是把他和这句话联系在一起因为它就在那儿
Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that.	现在我并不确定他是否说过这句话
There's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say is actually far nicer, and again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.	并没有确凿的证据可以证明，但事实上 他却说过更棒的话 一样 我也打印出来了 念给大家听
"The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this: What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest?	你们必然会问的 也是我必须回答的 第一问题是： 攀登珠穆朗玛峰有什么用呢？
And my answer must at once be, it is no use.	而我的答案毫无疑问一定是 毫无用处。
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.	爬珠穆朗玛峰不会带来哪怕是一丁点儿的好处
Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation, but otherwise nothing will come of it.	恩 我们可以了解一下 人体在高海拔地区会有哪些反应 或许医学人士可以 用我们的观察结果做一些航空学上有价值的解释 但在别的方面不会有任何收获
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, and not a gem, nor any coal or iron.	我们不会带着任何一点金银宝石或煤铁回来。
So it is no use.	我们找不到一寸土地 可种庄稼收获食物 所以真是一无是处。
If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go.	如果你无法理解 人就是有一种情结 要迎接山的挑战 要走出去和它相见 这种斗争 是人生永远的斗争 向上 永远向上 那么你永远都不明白我们为什么登山。
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy, and joy, after all, is the end of life.	我们探险旅程给予我们的是纯粹的快乐 而快乐 毕竟才是生命的终极。
We don't live to eat and make money.	我们活着不是为了吃饭挣钱。
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.	我们吃饭挣钱是为了能够享受生活。
That is what life means, and that is what life is for."	这才是生命的意义 这才是生活的目的。
Mallory's argument that leaving the house, embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun, however, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience.	马洛里坚持离开家踏上精彩的历险旅途 会多么快乐有趣 然而 这和我的经历并非完全一致
The furthest I've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly what came over me, but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.	2004年的春天 我第一次离开家去了生平最远的地方 我仍旧不知道自己哪儿来的主意 不过我的计划是单枪匹马穿越北冰洋

The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point, the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean, took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down, you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension, as I sat in a helicopter thundering north, and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.	从西伯利亚北部的一个气象站开始 到我最终的起点 北冰洋海岸上一块漂浮冰块的边沿 这一段小小旅程就花了整整五个小时 如果任何人看过菲利克斯·鲍姆加特纳升上太空 而不仅仅是他纵身一跳 那么就一定会有同感 正如我坐在一架轰鸣在北方高空的直升机上 那种感觉 我想一定就是末日临头的感觉
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into.	我坐在那儿 禁不住想究竟给自己惹了什么麻烦事儿。
There was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.	有一点点有趣 有一点点快乐。
I was 26.	那时我26岁。

I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.	我还记得望出窗外 看着第二架的直升机
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn, and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.	在西伯利亚无比美丽的破晓前 我们一同在空中轰鸣 一部分的我感觉像是杰森·伯恩和威弗瑞·塞西格的合体 还有一部分的我对自己感到非常自豪 但最多的感觉还是彻彻底底的恐惧
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.	这一旅程整整持续了10周，72天

The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea, so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean.	北极恰好位于大海中央 所以我的旅程穿越了北冰洋上冰冻的表面
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.	美国宇航局称当时的情况是有史以来最恶劣的。
I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies, about 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks was minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest.	我拖着180公斤的食物和400磅的燃料供给 整整10周里 平均温度是零下35度 最冷的时候有零下50度
So again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.	所以 再说一遍 真的没什么值得开心高兴的事儿
One of the magical things about this journey, however, is that because I'm walking over the sea, over this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux.	然而 这段旅程最神奇的事情之一是 因为我在穿越海洋 穿越北冰洋上 随波逐流的硬邦邦的冰块 那是一个流动的世界
The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around, refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever, possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.	冰块不停地移动 破裂 漂流 又重新结冻 因此 在那三个月里所见到的景象 对于我来说是独一无二 任何人都将不可能目睹那种景象 任何人都不可能见到我在那十周的日子里看到的景象
And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house.	我想也许这就是为什么要离开家最好的理由
I can try to tell you what it was like, but you'll never know what it was like, and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely, I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles, it was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day, the more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.	我可以尽量为大家形容那番景象 但你们永远都不可能真正知道 我越是想说明 就越觉得孤单 在方圆5百40万平方英里内 我是唯一一个人类 天气很冷 寒风凛凛的日子 有将近零下75度 言语越发显得贫乏 而我无法准确地形容
And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing, you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor, rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where the real meat of life is to be found, the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.	因此 对于我来说 你们知道 比起旁观想象 行动起来 努力体验 参与尝试 才能发现生命的真谛 才能从日常生活中获取动力之源
And I would add a cautionary note here, however.	然而 在这里我想提出一个警告
In my experience, there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible.	根据我的个人经验 人们对于在极限状态下 品味人生总会有些上瘾
Now I don't just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring-do, but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer, there is something addictive about this, and in my case, I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit.	我所指的不仅仅是爱德华七世时期 盛行的愚蠢大男子主义一类的大胆行径 还有像罹患胰腺癌什么的 又有些什么让人欲罢不能 而我的情况是 我认为或许极地探险 与一般人的毒瘾没有很大区别。
I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it, but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on, to ruin every relationship I've ever had, so be careful what you wish for.	除非你们亲身体验过 否则我无法解释清楚那感觉有多好 它能够让我心甘情愿花光手上每一分钱 抛弃一切友情爱恋 所以 一定要慎重
Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain, and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something in the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly in the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.	马洛里假定人类会本能地 回应高山的挑战 而我想是否是挑战本身 是努力的过程 特别是人类所面临的 巨大的 未竟的 确确实实的挑战在呼唤我们 以我的经验来说 正是如此。
There is one unfinished challenge that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life.	在我成年后的大多数岁月里 一个未竟的挑战一直在召唤我
Many of you will know the story.	你们当中有很多人会知道这个故事
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.	这是斯考特队长和他的团队的一张照片
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole.	斯考特在100多年前出发 试图成为第一位到达南极的人类
No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica.	人们对那里一无所知 从未有人他上过那片土地 我们对南极洲了解甚少 甚至不如我们对月球表面的了解。
Scott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team, who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot, all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges, and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there, I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.	如你们所知 斯考特失败了 败给了利用狗拉雪橇的罗尔德·亚孟森和他的挪威团队 斯考特和队员们靠双脚徒步前进 他们五个人背着吊带拖着雪橇徒步前进 而当他们到达南极时 却发现挪威旗帜早已捷足先登 我能够想象那是多么痛苦 令人沮丧
All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey.	五名队员一起掉头 向海岸前行 五个人都死在了回程的路上
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.	今天人们有一种误解 认为探险已经没有什么新奇的
When I talk about Antarctica, people often say, "Hasn't, you know, that's interesting, hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?"	当我谈起南极洲的时候 人们经常会说 你知道么 真是有意思啊 《兰彼得》的主持人不是刚骑车去过南极洲么
Or, "That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know.	又或是 真棒啊 你知道我祖母打算 明年乘游轮去南极洲 你说
Is there a chance you'll see her there?"	你们有可能在那儿碰面么？
But Scott's journey remains unfinished.	但是斯考特的旅程并未完成
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again.	还没有人成功地徒步往返 南极洲最边际的海岸线和南极之间
It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration, and it seemed to me high time, given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job.	可以说 这是探险的黄金年代 - 爱德华时代 最大胆的一次尝试 在我看来 正是时候 想想看这个世纪 我们上个世界解决那些问题 从坏血病到太阳能板 因此如果有人想尝试完成某项任务 这正是最好的时候。
So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.	所以 这正是我准备做的事情。
This time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.	明年这个时候 10月份 我将带领一个三人团队
It will take us about four months to make this return journey.	我们将要花费4个月左右走完往返的路程
That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.	这个比例尺 很显然这条红线表明往返南极的半程。
We have to turn around and come back again.	我们必须折返 踏上返程
I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before.	告诉大家我们将会发博客、发推特 我知道这很讽刺 你们将能够 以一种从未采用过的 间接但确实的方式 感受整段旅行
And it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question, "Why?"	同样对于我来说 在这四个月旅程中我将有机会 找到答案 很好地回答为什么这个问题
And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option.	比起从前 我们今天的生活更加安全舒适 当然也就不需要很多的探险者 读书时我的职业顾问 从未说过探险者会是一个职业选择
If I wanted to know, for example, how many stars were in the Milky Way, how old those giant heads on Easter Island were, most of you could find that out right now without even standing up.	比如说 如果我想知道 银河系有多少颗星星 复活岛上的巨石像存在了多少年 你们很多人甚至不用起立 就能马上找到答案
And yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places, it is that true, real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge, from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown.	而且 要说在这12年中在寒冷地带拖曳重物 我学到了什么 那么毫无疑问 那便是 来自困难 来自挑战 来之远离熟知的一切 迈向未知的领域 所带来的鼓舞和成长
In life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to, and I think metaphorically speaking, at least, we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.	生活中 我们都必须经历风暴 迈向极点 我想 打个比方说吧 只要我们能够鼓起勇气 多出去看看世界 那么我们就都能获益
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside.	我真得希望大家能够多踏出家门一点 看看外面的世界
Thank you very much.	非常感谢
About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius.	大概四年前，《纽约客》刊登了一篇文章 说在毛里求斯岛上的一个矿坑里 发现了许多埋藏的渡渡鸟遗骨
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished, all within about 150 years.	毛里求斯岛位于印度洋 在马达加斯加海岸的东边 渡渡鸟在那里被发现 也在那里灭绝 这一过程仅仅用了150年的时间
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find, because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton.	这次考古发现让每个人欢呼雀跃 因为这意味着人们终于有机会 组装出单只渡渡鸟的完整骨架
See, while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody -- not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo.	尽管世界上有很多博物馆 收藏有渡渡鸟的骨架 但即使是毛里求斯岛的自然历史博物馆 也没有一具骨架标本 是由单只渡渡鸟遗体制成的
Well, this isn't exactly true.	呃，其实这么不完全准确
The fact is, is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century -- it was actually mummified, skin and all -- but in a fit of space-saving zeal, they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire.	事实上，在大英博物馆 直到18世纪 还收藏有一副完整的渡渡鸟标本 实际上这是个保有皮肤的完整的木乃伊标本 但是为了满足节省空间的热情 他们竟把头和脚都切下来 然后把其它的部分丢进篝火烧掉了
The frontispiece of this article was this photo, and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker, because this photo completely rocked my world.	文章的第一页便是这张图片 我觉得蒂娜·布朗很了不起 他为《纽约客》提供了许多图片 而这张图片彻底震撼了我的世界
I became obsessed with the object -- not just the beautiful photograph itself, and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible, the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together -- there's an entire story here.	我被它完全迷住了 不仅仅因为美丽的图片本身 还有它的颜色、薄薄的触摸感、可见的细节 你能看到鸟喙上的金属线 那是用来连接起整个骨架的 这整个就是一个故事
And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton?	我自己在想 如果能有个属于自己的渡渡鸟骨架 该有多棒
I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell, and this was the very latest one.	好，此刻我想指出的一点是 我的整个人生 都在迷恋着事物，极其背后的故事 这是最近的一个
No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.	但错误已经铸成
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my "Creative Projects" folder -- it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.	在我的创造性项目文件夹里 我已经保存了几百张渡渡鸟骨架的图片 那里就像我大脑的仓库，储藏着一切我可能感兴趣的东西
Any time I have an internet connection, there's a sluice of stuff moving into there, everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.	每一次连上互联网 就有无数的东西涌了进来 从漂亮的指环到驾驶室图片
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille.	拉法叶为庆祝攻陷巴士底狱 送给华盛顿的钥匙
This folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it's growing constantly.	里面有17000张图片 超过20G的信息容量 而且还在不断增加
And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been maybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids, and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day.	几个星期后的某一天，或许已经过了一年了 我和孩子走进艺术商店想买些黏土材料 我们准备过一个手工艺日
I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.	我买了一些雕塑土，一些铁线支架和其他材料
And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought, maybe, yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.	看着雕塑土我忽然想到 也许 也许我可以自己来做个渡渡鸟头骨
I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor; I'm a hard-edged model maker.	我得先说一下——我并不是个雕塑家 我只是一个硬边模型制作者
You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate, you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" -- especially parts from "Star Wars" -- I can do this stuff all day long.	给我一张图纸，就给了我复制的动力 给我一台起重机，脚手架，不给我看《星球大战》 尤其不能给我看《星球大战》 然后我就能一整天鼓捣这些玩意
It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.	这就是我15年来如何谋生的
But you give me something like this -- my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this; it's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" -- this is not my thing -- this is something other people do -- dragons, soft things.	但如果你给我这样的东西 我的朋友迈克·默南做了这个雕塑 这是为《星球大战》第二部所做的初步模型 这不是我要做的 这是给别的人做的——龙，一些软活
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it -- I mean, it couldn't be that difficult.	但我觉得自己已经看了足够多的渡渡鸟骨架图片 实际上已经能够理解它的解剖结构 或许也可以复制一个了 我是说，这并不是那么难
So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.	我开始看能找到的最好的那些图片
I grabbed all the reference, and I found this lovely piece of reference.	我搜寻所有的参考资料 找到了这篇可爱的材料
This is someone selling this on eBay; it was clearly a woman's hand, hopefully a woman's hand.	它是某人在eBay上出售的东西 这是，明显是，很可能是一只女人的手
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand, I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.	假设它的大小和我妻子的手差不多 我测量了她的拇指，然后把数据扩展到头骨大小
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that, along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be, exactly how long, etc.	扩展到实际尺寸之后 我就开始把这些数据与其他的资料进行比较 弄清楚鸟喙实际到底应该有多大 实际应该有多长，等等
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I -- it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.	几小时后我终于搞清楚什么才是比较合理的渡渡鸟头骨 不过我没有继续下去 这有点像在清理一个超乱的房间时 你只能每次收拾一件东西，你不能想到所有的一切
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton; I just noticed that as I finished this skull, the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.	我当时没有想到渡渡鸟骨架 我只注意到自己完成了这个头骨 用来固定的支架金属线 从原本应该是脊柱的位置穿了出来
And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.	多年来我一直感兴趣并着迷的另一种东西 便是脊柱和骨架，我已经搜集了数百个
I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.	实际上我已经足够了解椎骨的力学机制 似乎可以模仿一下了
And so button by button, vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.	接着我就一步一步，一块椎骨接着一块椎骨 自己鼓捣了起来
And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull, a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.	最后到那天结束，我已经有了个不错的头骨 一个恰到好处的脊椎和半个骨盆
And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference, every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.	我继续寻找着更多的参考资料 绘画、漂亮的图片，以及一切能找到的资料
This guy -- I love this guy!	我爱这个家伙！
He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler.	他把渡渡鸟腿骨和尺子 放到了扫描器里
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted, and I replicated every last bone and put it in.	这就是我想要的精确 每一块 我复制了每一块骨头然后放进去
And after about six weeks, I finished, painted, mounted my own dodo skeleton.	大概过了六个星期 我安装、上漆 完成了属于我自己的渡渡鸟骨架
You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo.	你能看到我还给它做了个博物馆标签 写上有关渡渡鸟历史的简短介绍
And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it -- a museum vitrine.	而TAP塑料公司还做了个博物馆陈列橱窗给我 我没拍下来
Again, like I said, my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell, and also making them for myself, obtaining them, appreciating them and diving into them.	如我所说，我的生活都是关于 对事物及其背后的故事着迷 还有为自己制作、获得这些东西 欣赏它们，沉浸其中
And in this folder, "Creative Projects," there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on, projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day, and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch.	而在这个创造性项目文件夹里 有许许多多我正在进行的项目 有的已经有所进展，有的将在未来某一天开始着手 还有一些东西我只是想找到、买到 看一看，摸一摸
But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different, that I -- you know, I have my own R2D2, but that's -- honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.	现在还有了一类新的东西 我能够雕塑的东西 这很不一样 我有了自己的R2D2 说实话对我来说，跟雕刻比起来，这简单多了
And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder, and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.	因此我回头仔细审视了创造性项目文件夹 突然发现了《马耳他之鹰》
Now, this is funny for me: to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel, because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people, Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.	很有意思 我爱上了汉密特小说里的一件东西 因为如果它存在，世界上的人就将分为两种类型 钱德勒人和汉密特人，我绝对属于钱德勒人（钱德勒和汉密特均为美国侦探小说家）
But in this case, it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story, it's about the object in and of itself.	不过这里与作者无关 与书或电影或故事无关 只与这件物品自身有关
And in this case, this object is -- plays on a host of levels.	在这里，这个物品 具有许多层的意义
First of all, there's the object in the world.	首先，是有这么个东西
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk."	这就是Kniphausen Hawk
It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a Swedish Count, and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.	一个仪式用的浇筑模型 是1700年为一位瑞典伯爵所制作的 它很可能就是汉密特 写《马耳他之鹰》的灵感来源
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.	因此就有了汉密特为小说所创作的鸟
Built out of words, it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie, in which another object is created: a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words, inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.	由词汇制成 驱动着书的内容，以及电影情节的发展 故事中还创造了另一件东西 一个代表汉密特在书中所描述物品的道具 道具代表了电影中的猎鹰，其实还是受Kniphauser Hawk的启发
And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire.	然后就到了第四个层次 世界上又一个完全崭新的物品 为电影而做的这个道具 凭其本身 成为一个完全不一样的物品 一个完全的新的欲望象征
And so now it was time to do some research.	所以是时候做些研究了
I actually had done some research a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.	实际上我在几年前已经做了一部分研究 所以才有个文件夹在那里
I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the Maltese Falcon on eBay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference.	我还在eBay上买了一个马耳他之鹰的复制品 一个十分蹩脚的复制品 我还下载了足够多的图片 作为适当的参考
But I discovered, in researching further, really wanting precise reference, that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in 1994, and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue, and in it I found this magnificent picture, which included a size reference.	但在做了更多研究后 特别是需要精确参考的时候 我发现 一只原版的铅制雕塑 1994年在克里斯蒂拍卖行被拍卖了 所以我就联系了一位爱好古董的书商 他有克里斯蒂拍卖行目录的原稿 我从中找到了这张极好的图片 还附有尺寸参照
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.	由此我便能扫描图片，将它放大到完整的尺寸
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan, a New Jersey editor, actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991, although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications, because there was a lot of controversy about it.	我还找到另一个参照，来自Avi [Ara] Chekmayan 新泽西的一位编辑 是他于1991年在一个跳蚤市场上 发现了这个树脂制的马耳他雄鹰 因为争议很大 他总共花了五年时间 才验明这就是 拍卖商说明书描述的真品
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made.	它是用树脂做的 这在当时并不是一种做电影道具的常见材料
It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it, because I can see it compared to this thing, and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing, it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.	有意思的是，我花了好一会才鉴定它是真的 当它和这一个比较 我能保证，这的的确确是真的 都是从一个模子里出来的
In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial, Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this -- I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars -- they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom -- not just a front elevation, but also a side, rear and other side elevation.	这一个，因为拍卖会实际上很有争议 我记得Profiles in History拍卖行 1995年时为它拍出了10万美金 可以从底部看到 他们不仅仅提供了正面图 还提供了侧面、背面 和其他角度的视图
So now, I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon.	这样，我就有了所需的结构资料 来复制马耳他之鹰
What do they do, how do you start something like that?	他们怎么做的，如何开始？
I really don't know.	我一无所知
So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull, I blew all my reference up to full size, and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references.	所以这一次，我就跟做渡渡鸟头骨那样 把参照材料放大到完整尺寸 然后删去不合适的材料 再利用那些模版作为形状参考
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it, and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.	接着我就用Sculpey雕塑土做了一个雏形 直到我获得正确的侧面图之后我才
And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail, I worked out and achieved -- working in front of the television and Super Sculpey -- here's me sitting next to my wife -- it's the only picture I took of the entire process.	慢慢地，一根羽毛一根羽毛地 逐渐逐渐做出了想要的结果 ——在电视前鼓捣雕塑土 这是我坐在妻子旁边 这也是整个过程中我拍的唯一一张照片
As I moved through, I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.	到最后，我终于 做成了一个很不错的马耳他之鹰复制品
But again, I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like, I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey; I certainly wasn't able to get it.	但我仍然不是一个雕塑家 有好多技巧我都不知道 我不知道老友Mike做的雕塑表面为何既漂亮又光彩照人 我就是没办法做到
So, I went down to my shop, and I molded it and I cast it in resin, because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.	所以我去到我的店里 做了个模型，用树脂铸了一个 因为用树脂做，我就绝对能进行玻璃光面精整
Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.	有很多填充和光面精整的方法
My preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer.	我喜欢的是用这种粗糙的黑色汽车底漆 涂上大概70层
I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell, but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass-smooth.	我喷了三四天，油漆滴个不停 不过得到的磨砂表面相当的不错 我才可以对它做玻璃抛光
Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end, and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.	现在，这件非同寻常的作品就出炉了 因为在电影里，当他们最后把鸟拿出来的时候 他们把它放在桌上，旋转它
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.	所以我可以利用 屏幕截图和停格显示来确定
And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.	我按照电影里的灯光照射方式 确保用同样位置的灯光照射能取得相同的反射光 这就是我想达到的细节水平
I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.	最后我得到了这个：我的马耳他之鹰
And it's beautiful.	它很漂亮。
And I can state with authority at this point in time, when I'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you, is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.	而且此时此刻我可以负责任地说 当我完成这个作品时 在所有的复制品——其实也很少——中 它是最最精确 表现马耳他之鹰原件的 而原件，我可以告诉你们 是有一个名叫弗雷德·塞克斯顿的人雕塑的
This is where it gets weird.	事情的蹊跷就在这里
Now, James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon, killed James Elroy's mother.	现在，詹姆斯·艾尔罗伊相信 弗雷德·塞克斯顿，马耳他之鹰的雕塑者 杀死了他的母亲
I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974, during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon," called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon -- one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum.	还有更蹊跷的。1974年 在马耳他之鹰的一部怪诞喜剧续集 乔治·西格尔领衔主演的黑鸟的拍摄中 洛杉矶县立艺术博物馆 拥有的一个马耳他之鹰石膏原件 为电影拍摄所做的六个石膏原件之一 被偷出了博物馆。
A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie.	许多人认为 这只是电影方的作秀
John's Grill, which actually is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon," is still a viable San Francisco eatery, counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook, who played Wilmer Cook in the movie, and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.	Johns Grill餐厅 在马耳他之鹰里短暂出现过 至今仍然在旧金山营业 伊莱沙·库克也曾是这家餐厅的顾客之一 他曾在影片中扮演威尔默·库克 他还将最早的马耳他之鹰石膏像之一 赠送给了这家餐厅
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years, until it got stolen in January of 2007.	在餐厅的橱柜里放了约15年之后 在2007年1月 塑像被偷走了
It looked really great, the light worked on it really well, it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world.	我现在有了这只猎鹰 它很可爱，看上去真的很不错 上面的光线也很好 它比我能够实现和得到的任何东西 都要好
But there was a problem. And the problem was that: I wanted the entirety of the object, I wanted the weight behind the object.	但还有一个问题： 我想要让它变得完整 我要知道它确切的重量
This thing was made of resin and it was too light.	这个是用树脂做的，太轻了
There's this group online that I frequent.	这里有个我常常光顾的在线小组
It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade, make and travel in information about movie props.	上面都是些像我一样的道具狂人 叫道具复制品论坛，人们在上面交流 有关电影道具的制作、交易和推销等信息
And it turned out that one of the guys there, a friend of mine that I never actually met, but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.	我在上面找到了一个朋友 我们从未见面，由几次道具交易成了哥们 他竟然是当地一家铸造厂的经理
He took my master Falcon pattern, he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me, and this is the bronze I got back.	他用我的猎鹰原始模型 用失蜡铸造法 铸了一个青铜的给我 这就是我带回来的青铜像
And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.	经过酸蚀处理后我最终得到了这个
And this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.	这个结果让我非常非常满意
Here, I'm going to put it out there, later on tonight, and I want you to pick it up and handle it.	过一会我将把它放到那儿 晚些时候 我希望你们拿起它，触摸它
You want to know how obsessed I am.	你就会知道 我有多着迷。
This project's only for me, and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper, in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...	这个项目是最适合我的 我还更进一步 到eBay上买了一份1941年旧金山出的中文报纸 这样猎鹰才能完全像电影里一样
like it is in the movie.	包装起来
Yeah, I know!	是的，没错！
There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.	看，它的重量是27.5磅
That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.	我的狗赫胥黎体重的一半
But there's a problem.	不过还是有个问题
Now, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.	这是猎鹰系列最近的一些作品
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.	左边边上是我从eBay上买的一个复制品，做得很烂
There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon, because I had to get it back out of the mold.	这里有我做的，有些损坏的猎鹰雕塑 因为我要把它从模子里拿出来。
There's my first casting, there's my master and there's my bronze.	有我最早铸造的模型 还有我做的原始模型和青铜模型
There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things, which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin, you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.	在做模子和浇铸的时候 每一次你把它放到硅胶中，开始用树脂浇铸时 都会损失一小点体积
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one, it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.	当我把青铜模型和雕塑土模型放在一起的时候 我发现青铜模型小了快四分之一
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah -- why didn't I remember this?	是的，真的，这就像啊啊…… 我为什么把这给忘了？
Why didn't I start and make it bigger?	为什么一开始我不把它做大一点？
So what do I do?	那么怎么办好？
I figure I have two options.	我发现我有两个选择
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it, which I have already done, to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.	一，我可以用激光照一照 这个已经做好的模型 对这个猎鹰做一个3维立体扫描
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3D lithography master of this, which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze.	我已经测出从蜡制模型到青铜模型 之间缩水的确切值 再把它放大到 足够做一个三维平版模型 擦亮之后，我可以把它交给铸模的人 然后我就能得到青铜模型 或这，或许那些拥有原件的人 我一直在试图联系他们 希望他们能让我花上几分钟 看一看其中的一个原件，或者拍个照 甚至让我用手执式激光扫描仪来扫描一下 这个小仪器刚好能放进麦片盒里 我发誓，甚至不用碰到他们的猎鹰 我就能得到完美的三维扫描图。
Or: There are several people who own originals, and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them, hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture, or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box, and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear, get a perfect 3D scan.	我甚至想签文件 保证我绝不会让它从我的办公室流出，落入别人手里
And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.	然后，也许，这一切就告一段落了
But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves, I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.	但事实上，如果我们诚实地面对自己 我要说，完成这一番功课 所得到的远不仅仅是最初想要的结果而已
Thank you.	谢谢
I'm a process engineer.	我是一个工艺工程师。
I know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that, but I also have Marfan syndrome.	我知道所有锅炉和焚烧炉的一切， 包括像织物过滤器和旋风分离器一样的东西。 但是我也患有马凡氏综合征
This is an inherited disorder.	这是一种遗传性疾病
And in 1992 I participated in a genetic study and found to my horror, as you can see from the slide, that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range, the green line at the bottom.	1992年开始 我参加了一个基因研究 正向你们在幻灯片中看到的，我惊恐的发现， 我的主动脉压不在一个正常值范围内 下面的绿色区域是正常值。
Everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm.	在这儿的所有人都应该在3.2到3.6厘米之内
I was already up at 4.4.	而我的则在4.4。
And as you can see, my aorta dilated progressively, and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary.	向你所看到的， 我的动脉扩张速度越来越快。 手术也越来越 成为必要的治疗。
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome -- anesthetize you, open your chest, put you on an artificial heart and lung machine, drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade, stop your heart, cut the aorta out, replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta, and, most importantly, commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy, normally warfarin.	手术非常可怕 - 首先将麻醉你，打开你的腹腔 将你转换上人工心肺机器， 将你的体温降低到到18摄氏度， 停止你的心跳，切除大动脉， 用一个塑料瓣膜和大动脉取代， 而最重要的是， 你将一生都需要接受使用华法林 的抗凝治疗。
The thought of the surgery was not attractive.	采取手术的方法不是我所愿意的
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening.	而需要使用华法林治疗的想法 是真的很可怕。
So I said to myself, I'm an engineer, I'm in R and D, this is just a plumbing problem.	所以我对自己说，我是一名搞研究开发的工程师， 而这只是一个管道的问题。
I can do this.	我可以这样做。
I can change this.	我可以更改此设置。
So I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation.	所以我开始 改变整个治疗 主动脉扩张的方法
The project aim is really quite simple.	项目的目的是很简单的。
The only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with Marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength.	马凡氏综合征的人的 升主动脉的真正问题 是它缺乏一些拉力。
So the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe.	所以简单的在管道的外层包装 的可能性是存在的。
And it would remain stable and operate quite happily.	这样它便会保持稳定并且很好的发挥作用。
If your high-pressure hose pipe, or your high-pressure hydraulic line, bulges a little, you just wrap some tape around the outside of it.	如果您的高压软管 或您的高压液压线，变涨一点， 您只需要在它的外部缠绕一些胶带。
It really is that simple in concept, though not in execution.	概念上来说，它真的就这么简单， 但实行上却恰恰相反。
The great advantage of an external support for me was that I could retain all of my own bits, all of my own endothelium and valves, and not need any anticoagulation therapy.	外部支持对我来说最大的好处是 我可以保留所有我自己的身体部分， 所有我自己的内皮细胞和瓣膜， 并且不需要任何的抗凝治疗。
So where do we start?	所以我们从哪里开始？
Well this is a sagittal slice through me.	好，这是我的矢状切片。
You could see in the middle that device, that little structure, squeezing out.	你可以看到在中间 有个很小的结构在往外压挤。
Now that's a left ventricle pushing blood up through the aortic valve -- you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there -- up into the ascending aorta.	这是左心室 通过主动脉阀挤压血液 - 你能看到两个的主动脉瓣的工作 — 到升大动脉。
And it's that part, the ascending aorta, which dilates and ultimately bursts, which, of course, is fatal.	就是这一部分升大动脉 不停的扩张并最终破裂， 造成致命的后果。
We started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance imaging machines and CT imaging machines from which to make a model of the patient's aorta.	我们开始通过核磁共振成像仪器和 电脑断层扫描来 采集图像， 为病人的制造主动脉的 模型。
This is a model of my aorta.	这是一个我的主动脉模型。
I've got a real one in my pocket, if anyone would like to look at it and play with it.	我也带着一个真模型， 如果任何人想看看它，玩玩它。
You can see, it's quite a complex structure.	你可以看到，它是相当复杂的结构。
It has a funny trilobal shape at the bottom, which contains the aortic valve.	在它的底部有一个有趣的三叶形形状， 其中包含主动脉瓣。
It then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off.	接着它慢慢变成了圆形， 然后逐渐变细。
So it's quite a difficult structure to produce.	所以它是一个相当难生产的 结构。
This, like I say, is a CAD model of me, and this is one of the later CAD models.	就像我说的，这是一个 CAD 模型， 这是之后众多的CAD模型之一
We went through an iterative process of producing better and better models.	我们经历了一个生产更好和更好的模型 的迭代过程。
When we produced that model we turn it into a solid plastic model, as you can see, using a rapid prototyping technique, another engineering technique.	当我们制作这个模型的时候 我们把它变成一个实体的塑料模型 正如您所看到的 利用快速成型技术， 另一种工程技术。
We then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh, which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta.	然后，我们使用它 来制造完全订制的 以之前的模型为形状的 完全适合大动脉的 多孔纺织网。
So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really.	因此，这是完完全全的 最好的个体化医疗。
Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant.	我们的每一个病患 都有一个完全為他们订制的植入物。
Once you've made it, the installation's quite easy.	一旦你做好它，安装很容易。
John Pepper, bless his heart, professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in, didn't like it, took it out, put the second one in.	John Pepper， 胸心外科教授 - 从未做过这个手术 - 他植入第一个后，不喜欢它，把它取出来，又植入了第二个。
Happy, away I went.	然后我开心的离开了。
Four and a half hours on the table and everything was done.	手术桌上的四个半小时，所有事情都完成了。
So the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part.	所以外科植入其实是最容易的部分。
If you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative, the so-called composite aortic root graft, there are one of two startling comparisons, which I'm sure will be clear to all of you.	如果你比较一下我们的疗程和现有的替代方法， 所谓的复合主动脉根部移植物， 会有两个令人吃惊的比较， 明显的展现在各位眼前。
Two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the existing treatment.	植入我们的设备需要两个小时 而现有的治疗需要 六个小时。
The existing treatment requires, as I've said, the heart and lung bypass machine and it requires a total body cooling.	正如我说的，现有的替代治疗需要 人工心肺机器， 并需要完全的人体冷却。
We don't need any of that; we work on a beating heart.	我们不需要任何这些设备；我们在治疗一个跳动的心脏
He opens you up, he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating, all at the right temperature.	他打开你的胸腔，在适当的温度下， 在你心脏跳动的时候接触到你的主动脉。
No breaking into your circulatory system.	你的血液循环系统也不需要被打断。
So it really is great.	所以真的非常好。
But for me, absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy required.	但对我来说，最好的一点 是完全不需要抗凝治疗。
I don't take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that I would choose to take.	我根本不需要使用任何药品， 除了我选择吃的消遣性的药物。
And in fact, if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin, it is a serious compromise to your quality of life.	事实上，如果你和那些在长期进行华凡林治疗的人交谈， 它对你的生活质量有着严重的损害。
And even worse, it inevitably foreshortens your life.	更糟的是， 它不可避免的缩短你的生命。
Likewise, if you have the artificial valve option, you're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment at all.	同样，如果您选择了人工瓣膜， 当你接受任何有侵犯性的治疗的时候， 你都需要使用抗生素疗程。
Even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics, in case you get an internal infection on the valve.	甚至于连去牙医都需要使用抗生素， 来预防任何的瓣膜的内部感染。
Again, I don't have any of that, so I'm entirely free.	再次，我完全没有以上的担忧，所以我是完全自由的。
My aorta is fixed, I haven't got to worry about it, which is a rebirth for me.	我的主动脉已经治好了，我不需要担心它 这对我来说是一个重生。
Back to the theme of the presentation: In multidisciplinary research, how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life?	回到演讲的主题： 在多学科研究领域内， 一个习惯与锅炉打交道的工艺工程师是怎样 建造了一个医疗设备 并改变了自己的生命？
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team.	答案就是一个跨领域的团队。
This is a list of the core team.	这是核心团队的名单。
And as you can see, there are not only two principal technical disciplines there, medicine and engineering, but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines.	就像你所看到的， 它不仅仅包括了两个大的领域， 医学和工程学， 也包括了这两种领域中的 各种专业人员。
John Pepper there was the cardiac surgeon who did the actual work on me, but everyone else there had to contribute one way or another.	John Pepper 是给我做手术的心脏外科医生。 而这里面的每个人都做出了一定的贡献。
Raad Mohiaddin, medical radiologist: We had to get good quality images from which to make the CAD model.	Raad Mohiaddin，医疗放射学家： 我们需要获取高质量的图像 来制作 CAD 模型。
Warren Thornton, who still does all our CAD models for us, had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set.	沃伦 · 桑顿仍为我们做我们所有的 CAD 模型。
There are some problems with it.	尽管这样还有一些困难和问题存在。
Jargon is a big one.	行业术语是个大问题。
I would think no one in this room understands those four first jargon points there.	我认为在这个房间里没有人懂 这四个行业术语的意思。
The engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and CAD.	你们之中的工程师 知道快速成型和 CAD。
The medics amongst you, if there are any, will recognize the first two.	你们当中的医生可能认识前两个。
But there will be nobody else in this room that understands all of those four words.	但这个房间里没有任何一个人 知道全部四个。
Taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used.	将行业术语剔除 对确保团队中的每个人都能 在一个词条被使用时 明白它的意思，非常重要。
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well.	我们行业习惯的不同也非常的有趣。
We took a lot of horizontal slice images through me, produced those slices and then used those to build a CAD model.	我们做了很多我的水平切片图像 生产这些切片，然后使用它们建立 CAD 模型。
And the very first CAD model we made, the surgeons were playing with the plastic model, couldn't quite figure it out.	我们的第一个CAD模型 外科医生们在把玩了这个塑料模型后， 都搞不明白是怎么回事。
And then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta.	然后我们意识到这是实际上一个真正的主动脉 的镜像图像。
And it was a mirror image because in the real world we always look down on plans, plans of houses or streets or maps.	它是一个镜像图像， 因为在现实世界中我们总是向下看规划图， 房子或街道的规划图。
In the medical world they look up at plans.	在医学中我们向上看
So the horizontal images were all an inversion.	所以那些水平图像都反转了。
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions.	所以每个人都需要注意行业的习惯。
Everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not assumed.	每个人都需要了解 什么是假设了的，什么没有被假设。
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project.	制度性障碍 在项目中是另一个让人头痛的问题。
The Brompton Hospital was taken over by Imperial College's School of Medicine, and there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations.	布朗普顿医院被 帝国学院医学院的医学院接管了， 而两个组织之间 有一些严重的关系问题。
I was working with Imperial and the Brompton, and this generated some serious problems with the project, really problems that shouldn't exist.	我在和帝国和布朗普顿工作， 这就产生了一些严重的问题， 真的不应该存在的问题。
Research and ethics committee: If you want to do anything new in surgery, you have to get a license from your local research and ethics.	研究与伦理委员会： 如果你想做任何新的手术， 你要从您的本地研究和伦理获得许可证。
I'm sure it's the same in Poland.	我确信在波兰也是这样的。
There will be some form of equivalent, which licenses new types of surgery.	会有某些相同的模式， 颁发新的的手术许可证。
We didn't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that, was also had professional jealousies.	我们不是仅遇到了官僚主义的问题 也遭到了一些同行的猜忌。
There were people on the research and ethics committee who really didn't want to see John Pepper succeed again, because he's so successful.	有些研究和伦理委员会的人 不希望看到John Pepper再次成功， 因为他已经是如此的成功，
And they made extra problems for us.	并且他们为我们设置更多的问题和麻烦。
Bureaucratic problems: Ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a guidance note going out for all of the hospitals in the country.	官僚主义的问题： 当你有一个新的治疗方法的时候 你必须给国内的每一个医院寄出一个 指导书。
In the U.K. we have the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, NICE.	在英国，我们有国家卫生医疗质量标准署，NICE。
You'll have an equivalent in Poland, no doubt.	毫无疑问，波兰也有相似的机构。
We had to get past the NICE problem.	我们必须在NICE过关。
We now have a great clinical guidance out on the Net.	我们现在在网上有一个很好的临床指导书。
So any of the hospitals interested can come along, read the NICE report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves.	所以任何有兴趣的医院 可以来看NICE的报告 与我们取得联系，然后可以自己运行。
Funding barriers: Another big area to be concerned with.	资金壁垒： 要关注的另一个重要领域。
A big problem with understanding one of those perspectives: When we first approached one of the big U.K. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff, what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal.	理解这些情况的时候，一个大的问题是 当我们第一次接触 一个大的英国提供这类资助的慈善机构 他们看到的从根本上是一个工程提议。
They didn't understand it; they were doctors, they were next to God.	他们都不懂它 ；他们是医生，他们就在上帝的身边。
It must be rubbish.	所以它一定是垃圾。
They binned it.	他们把它丢弃一边。
So in the end I went to private investors and I just gave up on it.	所以最终我去找了私人投资者 并且我放弃了那些机构。
But most R and D is going to be institutionally funded, by the Polish Academy of Sciences or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council or whatever, and you need to get past those people.	但大多数的 研究开发项目的资金来源都是 由波兰科学院 在工程和物理研究院的机构提供， 和您需要获得这些人的同意。
Jargon is a huge problem when you're trying to work across disciplines, because in an engineering world, we all understand CAD and R.P. -- not in the medical world.	当你尝试着跨领域工作时，行业术语是一个大问题。 因为在工程世界里， 我们都了解 CAD 和 R.P.— 而医疗世界并不明白。
I suppose ultimately the funding bureaucrats have really got to get their act together.	我想最终筹资的官僚们一定要开始有所作为，
They've really got to start talking to each other, and they've got to exercise a bit of imagination, if that's not too much to ask -- which it probably is.	开始和其他的机构沟通， 开始用一点想象力， 如果这不是过分的要求 — 虽然它很可能是。
I've coined a phrase "obstructive conservatism."	我已经创造了一个短语阻碍性保守。
So many people in the medical world don't want to change, particularly not when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer.	医学世界里很多人都不想改变， 尤其是当一个工程师莫名其妙的跳出来并带来了答案。
They don't want to change.	他们不想改变。
They simply want to do whatever they've done before.	他们只是想做他们之前做过的。
And in fact, there are many surgeons in the U.K.	事实上，有很多外科医生在英国
still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of episode, so that they can say, "Ah, I told you that was no good."	仍在等待我们的病人中的一两个 发生一些小插曲 这样，他们可以说，啊，我告诉你那不好。
We've got 90 post-op patient years between us, and we haven't had a single problem.	所有的病患手术后加起来的时间有90年， 但我们没有发生过一个问题。
And still, there are people in the U.K. saying, "Yeah, that external aortic root, yeah, it'll never work, you know."	尽管如此，仍然在英国有人说 哦，那是外部的主动脉支撑啊，是啊，它永远不会有效。
It really is a problem.	这真的是一个问题。
It really is a problem.	这真的是一个问题。
I'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics, doctors, surgeons at some point.	我相信在这个房间里的每个人在某种程度上都遇到过 医务、 医生、 外科医生的傲慢。
The middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves.	这仅仅是 医生们保护自己的方法。
"Yeah, well of course, I'm looking after my patient."	是啊，当然，我在保护我的病人。
I think it's not good, but there you are, that's my view.	我认为这不好，但你是这样的，这就是我的看法。
Egos, of course, again, a huge problem If you're working in a multidisciplinary team, you've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt.	自负，当然，这也是一个巨大的问题。 当你在一个跨领域的团队里面工作， 你必须对你的同事疑中留情，
You've got to express support for them.	必须要对他们表示支持。
Tom Treasure, professor of cardiothoracic surgery: incredible guy.	Tom Treasure，心胸外科教授： 一个令人难以置信的家伙。
Dead easy to give him respect.	非常容易给他尊重。
Him giving me respect?	淡他给我尊重呢？
Slightly different.	这就稍有不同了。
That's all the bad news.	这些都是不好的消息。
The good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge.	好消息便是它的益处非常的大。
Translate that one.	翻译这个。
I bet they can't.	我敢打赌他们不能。
When you have a group of people who have had a different professional training, a different professional experience, they not only have a different knowledge base, but they have a different perspective on everything.	当你有一群 得到了不同专业训练和职业经验的人， 他们不仅有不同的知识储备， 也对每个事物都有不同的观点。
And if you can bring those guys together and you can get them talking and understanding each other, the results can be spectacular.	如果你可以把这些人聚集在一起 并让他们开始交流和理解对方， 结果将会是非常棒的。
You can find novel solutions, really novel solutions, that have never been looked at before very, very quickly and easily.	您可以找到新的解决方案，真正的新解决方案， 那种从没有看到过的， 非常、 非常的容易和快。
You can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have.	只需你能使用这些延长的知识库， 你可以减少很多的工作。
And as a result, it's an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you.	结果便是 一个完全不同的使用科技和 你周围的知识的方式。
The result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets.	这一切的结果便是 你可以以很小的预算 获得很快的进展。
I'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that I'm not prepared to tell you what it cost.	我对我为从我的想法变成现实 花了那么少的钱而感到羞愧， 所以我并不打算告诉你们我花了多少。
Because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the USA which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality.	因为我怀疑， 在美国有着完全 常规性的手术疗程， 在一个病患上的成本， 都比我从我的梦想 到现实 花费的更多。
That's all I want to say, and I've got three minutes left.	这就是我想说的，我还剩三分钟。
So Heather's going to like me.	所以 Heather 会喜欢我。
If you have any questions, please come up and talk to me later on.	如果您有任何疑问，请之后和我联系。
It would be a pleasure to speak with you.	能和你们交流时我荣幸。
Many thanks.	非常感谢！
I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.	我在日本东京居住并工作
And I specialize in human behavioral research, and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways, and to design for that future.	我致力于人类行为学的调研 然后运用我们所学到的知识用不同的方式去看待未来 并设计未来
And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years, and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.	坦诚的说，我已经做这行7年了 我仍不知道未来将会是怎样
But I've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there.	但我大致了解 人们的行为到了那时候将会是怎样
This is my office. It's out there.	这就是我的办公室，到处都是
It's not in the lab, and it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.	并不是坐在一个实验室里 大多数都在印度，中国，巴西和非洲
We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people.	我们共同生活在这个星球上 -63亿人类
About three billion people, by the end of this year, will have cellular connectivity.	其中大约30亿人，在今年年底 会接受到手机信号
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.	再过2年将会有另10亿人加入他们
And I mention this because, if we want to design for that future, we need to figure out what those people are about.	我要提到这点是因为 如果我们要为未来做设计 我们需要了解他们是怎么想的
And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is and what our team's job is.	这也是我工作的重点 也是我们团队的
Our research often starts with a very simple question.	我们的调研一般由一个比较简单的问题开场
So I'll give you an example. What do you carry?	比如： 你今天随身带了什么
If you think of everything in your life that you own, when you walk out that door, what do you consider to take with you?	你马上会想到你所拥有的所有财物 当你出门的时候 你会想今天我要带什么
When you're looking around, what do you consider?	你边找边想些什么
Of that stuff, what do you carry?	我到底要带那些东西呢
And of that stuff, what do you actually use?	那些你随身带的东西你会真正的用到呢
So this is interesting to us, because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.	这是我们感兴趣的地方 因为这是意识和潜意识做决定的一个过程 仔细想想如果你每天随身带的东西最后都派上了用场 那么在精神上，感情上和功能上都有一定的价值
And to put it really bluntly, you know, people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?	坦率的说 我们很舍得买一些有价值的东西 不是吗
So I've probably done about five years' research looking at what people carry.	所以关于这个我做了5年的调研 观察人们到底随身带些什么
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.	我会翻别人的包，摸他们的口袋，还有皮夹
I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide, and we follow them around town with video cameras.	我甚至会到世界各地拜访他们的家 然后带着摄像机和他们一起到城里转儿
It's kind of like stalking with permission.	这好像是经过批准的跟踪一样
And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question, what do people carry?	我们做这些只是为了找到问题的答案 人们到底随身带些什么？
And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.	我们发现我们随身带很多东西
OK, that's fair enough.	这个没什么错
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys, money and, if they own one, a mobile phone.	但当你问及哪3样东西是你每天必须要带的话 穿越文化，性别，上下文 大多数人会说钥匙，钱 手机，如果他们有的话
And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?	我没说这是个好东西，但是这是个东西是吧？
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.	我不能从你手中抢掉你的手机，扔掉
You'd probably kick me out, or something.	如果我那样做的话，你大概会打我一顿
OK, it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.	或者我这个举动有点太明显了 更不用说我是一个手机品牌的在职人员
But really, the question is, why? Right?	但是这是为什么呢
So why are these things so important in our lives?	为什么这些物品对我们那么重要呢
And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones.	我们的调研表明，这些物品是可以拯救你生命的 拯救我们自己和我们爱的人
So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth -- transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.	我们需要一把开启自家大门的钥匙 启动车，也需要钥匙。
And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.	手机其实是一个恢复工具
If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.	如果你对马斯洛需求层次理论感兴趣的话 这3个物品都能给人很好的辅助 但他们是马斯洛需求层次理论中排名最后的几位
Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff, but they're very good at this.	当然他们也有其他别的很多功能 但是他们的辅助功能特别突出
And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability to allow people to transcend space and time.	特别是对手机而言 让人们能够超越空间与时间
And what I mean by that is, you know, you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?	我的意思是 你可以通过打个电话来超越距离感
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience, and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.	或者你也可以根据你个人的情况而定发一个短消息打破时间的约束 接受者也可以在他们想看的时候再看
And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out, which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.	大众都普遍偏爱这种交流方式 这也是为什么全球有30亿人用手机建立联系的原因
And they value that connectivity.	他们也为此链接增加了价值
But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.	其实，电脑也可以做这事儿
And you can do them with phone kiosks.	用电话亭也行
And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.	但是手机它的好处是它非常个性化 给你足够的隐私并且很方便
You don't need to ask permission from anyone, you can just go ahead and do it, right?	你不用得到任何人的允许 你就直接一个电话过去了不是吗？
We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.	我们是人，我们会忘记事情，也算是我们自带功能的一种
I think, quite a nice feature.	我觉得这个功能挺好
So we forget, but we're also adaptable, and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.	我们会忘记，但是我们适应力很强 适应周遭的各种情况
And so we have these strategies to remember, and one of them was mentioned yesterday.	当然还有一些方法需要铭记 昨天还提到过一个
And it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.	比较简单， 反射效应
And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space, and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.	当你要出门的时候 你会转身摸一下自己的口袋
Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.	就连那些把东西放在皮包的女性朋友们也会做同样的动作
And you turn around, and you look back into the space, and some people talk aloud.	你会转身朝屋里看 有些人边看还边叫
And pretty much everyone does it at some point.	每个人时不时的都会这样
OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life, and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels, but most people have what we call a center of gravity.	再有，大多数人都有一个比较稳定的生活 我指的是，他们不用全世界到处跑或总是呆在酒店里 每个人都有一个放东西的地方我们称做重点位置
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.	这个重心位置是你专放这些物品的地方
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity, but over time, they gravitate there.	刚开始他们可能不是放在那里的 但随着时间的推移，他们就在那里扎根了
It's where you expect to find stuff.	比如你要找某些东西的时候
And in fact, when you're turning around, and you're looking inside the house, and you're looking for this stuff, this is where you look first, right?	其实 当你转过身 朝屋里看的时候 你就在找这些物品 这些会是你马上去找的地方不是吗
OK, so when we did this research, we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way to never forget anything ever, ever again.	所以我们做了调研 我们找到了一种100%保证你 再也不会忘记东西的方法
And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.	其实很简单，什么都不要记就可以了，就不会忘记了
OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?	笑 这听上去是不是有点好笑就是中国的幸运饼？
But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.	但其实这是一种分配工作的艺术
And from a design perspective, it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people.	从一个设计的角度来讲 关于自身对科技掌握的一种的理解 你能分配那些任务给其他人
And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be -- can be the solution for pretty much everything, apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.	如果你愿意你就可以分配任务给其他人 这几乎是解决所有的事的方法 除了生理的一些反应，比如去厕所
You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.	别人不能替你做这些事
And apart from things like entertainment, you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf, or, at least, not yet.	再有就是娱乐项目 你不会叫个人替你去电影院看电影 至少目前还不会
Maybe sometime in the future, we will.	可能将来我们会这么做
So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.	现在让我给你一个现实的分配任务的例子
So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate.	这是可能我最热衷做的事 一个我们对文盲的研究 他们是用什么来进行交流的
So, the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures -- that there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.	2004年U.N的统计数据表明 全球有大约有8亿是文盲，不会读也不会写
So, we've been conducting a lot of research.	所以我们做了很多调查
And one of the things we were looking at is -- if you can't read and write, if you want to communicate over distances, you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with.	引起我们注意的是 如果你不会读或写 但是你想通过距离来进行交流 你必须具有能力识别 那个与你做交流的人
It could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address, it could be a postal address.	可以是一个电话号码，或者电子邮箱的地址 邮政地址
Simple question: if you can't read and write, how do you manage your contact information?	很简单的一个问题，如果你不能读或写 你怎么搞定自己的联系方式呢？
And the fact is that millions of people do it.	事实证明很多人都可以应付的来
Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it, and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing.	从设计的角度讲， 我们不能理解他们是怎么做到的 这只是举个小小的例子 我们是怎么做我们的调研的
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.	其实文盲他们是委派任务的高手
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people, the stuff that they can't do themselves.	他们把一个任务中的几个部分委派给其他人 那些他们自己做不了的事
Let me give you another example of delegation.	举个例子
This one's a little bit more sophisticated, and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.	这个例子比较复杂 这是我们在乌干达做的一个调查 关于那里的人们共享并共用一个设备
OK?	它还有一个意思就是把话费当钱寄回去
And it works like this.	是这样运作的
So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.	比如果，June你在一个边远的村庄
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.	我是在坎帕拉的一个工薪阶层
I'm sending money back, and it works like this.	我要寄钱回去
So, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone, and that's the phone kiosk operator.	在你的村庄有个人他有个手机 他是共用电话亭的接线员
And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.	在共用电话亭应该有一个标准功能的手机
So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.	所以我会去买一个充值卡
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone, I call up the local village operator.	我不把钱充在我自己的电话里 我打电话给你村子的接线员
And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.	把充值卡上的密码告诉他，让他充到他的手机里
So, they're topping up the value from Kampala, and it's now being topped up in the village.	也就是说他从坎帕拉冲了值 里面的金额冲到了你村庄一名手机用户的账户上
You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission, and passes the rest over to you in cash.	你拿10-20%的佣金 共用电话亭接线员扣掉10-20%的佣金 然后再把多下来的钱以现金的方式给你
OK, there's two things I like about this.	所以整个过程中有两点我特别喜欢
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an ATM machine.	第一，任何能接触到手机的人 或拥有手机的人 其实就是个自动取款机
It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there's no banking infrastructure.	这带动了这个地方最根本的银行服务 虽然没有银行业的基础设施
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure, they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers, because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.	即使他们可以有机会接触到银行 银行也不会把他们视为有价值的用户 因为他们还不具备拥有银行账户的资格
There's a second thing I like about this.	第二点我喜欢的地方
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal, and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication, I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?	抛开我多年调研经验 和我们对事物的审美观 我无法设计与此一样优雅 并与当地的实际情况完全相符的一个系统
And, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.	是的，我们还有格莱珉银行和小金额贷款
But the difference between this and that is, there's no central authority trying to control this.	他们的区别是 这个系统是没有权威机构的束缚
This is just street-up innovation.	完全是街头的创新
So, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of inspiration for us.	所以 大街小巷永远是个 灵感的源头
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.	如果弄坏这个东西，你归还给出售者
They'll give you a new one.	他们会给你一个新的
They'll probably give you three new ones, right?	他们应该会给你3个新的不是吗？
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.	不是买三送一吗
If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.	如果你到印度或中国的街头 ，你会看到诸如此类的生意
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks, and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.	他们回收损坏的东西 然后修理后再循环出售
This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China, and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together.	在中国吉林的一个修理铺 你可以看到他们把一个手机拆开 然后再组装起来
They reverse-engineer manuals.	用手工破解这些手机的系统
This is a kind of hacker's manual, and it's written in Chinese and English.	这是一种黑客的破解方法 被印制成中文和英文
They also write them in Hindi.	甚至北印度语
You can subscribe to these.	你也可以订购一份
There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well.	他们还设立专门的培训班机构，一窝蜂的培训人 怎么修理机子
But what I like about this is, it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface, a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.	我比较欣赏其中的这点 最后这个生意在街边一个很小很矮的店铺落脚 一把螺丝刀，一把牙刷用来清理话筒部位 因为话筒总是粘灰比较多的地方
And it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.	这个是关于怎样传播这种知识，让它在整个社区传播
And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff, and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.	我喜欢这点的原因是因为这是对我们产品设计的一种挑战 和制造产品与潜在产品投放点的挑战
It challenges the norms.	也是对标准规格的一种挑战
OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.	对我来说，大街小巷会出现层出不穷的问题
Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.	比如，我在中国的小巷中的一个性保健店买了这瓶伟哥
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.	在中国，你可以买到不少假货
But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process.	我从另一个角度来观察，我觉得这个一个关于 购买过程中信任与自信的一条线索
And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply, for example, for the design of -- the lessons from this -- apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?	我们怎样把它运用到生活中呢 比如说， 做一个构想--从中我们学到的 怎样在这些市场策划线上服务与今后的新增服务
This is a pair of underpants from -- -- from Tibet.	这是一条 笑 从西藏买来的内裤
And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know, why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?	我看着它，自问 为什么有人会在内裤上做个口袋？
And I look at something like this and it makes me question, if we were to take all the functionality in things like this, and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network, how would we prioritize where to put stuff?	这个让我深思 如果我们考虑把这个东西的所有功能 分布到我们身体的各个部位 就好象是身体各个部位的联络网 那我们怎么决定那个口袋放什么呢？
And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks.	是，这看上去是有些繁琐，但这个可以联系到 身体各个部位的联络网
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda.	你们看到的是几个电话号码 在边缘乌干达门框上写着的电话号码
This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.	这些不是门牌而是电话号码
So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?	难道别人用手机来辨认谁是谁？
When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?	难道3亿人真的用手机号码来认人吗
Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK, for those extra three billion people.	那你对认人的概念也太落伍了 对这额外的3亿人来说
This is how it's shifting.	这就是演变的过程
And then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.	再来看一些照片，我拍的第一张照片
And this is from Delhi.	这是是印度的德里
It's from a study we did into illiteracy, and it's a guy in a teashop.	我们在那里做了对文盲的调研 这是个茶店里的伙计
You can see the chai being poured in the background.	你可以从后面看到他已经倒好的茶
And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker, on the lowest rungs in the society.	他是这个极其贫穷的茶点力的一个伙计 生活在社会最底层
And he, somehow, has the appreciation of the values of Livestrong.	但他对 耐克的LiveStrong手环的价值有着独特的钟爱
And it's not necessarily the same values, but some kind of values of Livestrong, to actually go out and purchase them, and actually display them.	这不是我们所说的金钱价值 而是这个手环所代表的意义的价值 所以他去购买这些手环 并展示他们
For me, this kind of personifies this connected world, where everything is intertwined, and the dots are -- it's all about the dots joining together.	对我来说这样的人格魅力可以带动整个世界 每样事物都交错在一起，个体 个体与个体联系到一起
OK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences," and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner, right?	这个演讲的标题为 联系与结论 这是我五年探索工作的总结 关于在这个星球上生存的每一个人 都有能力来穿越空间与时间 在一个私人与便捷的方式下 不是吗
When everyone's connected.	当每个人都被联系到一起
And there are four things.	其中有四个元素
So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas, the speed at which ideas go around.	第一是构想的直观性 构想酝酿的速度
And I know TED is about big ideas, but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.	我知道TED以出大构想为名 但是大构想的基准正在改变
If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet, that's the first thing.	如果你想要出大构想，你必须先接受这个星球上的每一个人 这个是第一步
The second thing is the immediacy of objects.	第二是目标的直观性
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller, as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking, identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.	当这些东西变的越来越小 他们的功能却越来越强大 比如银行业，身份认证 这些元素顺其自然的在全球传播的很快
And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid, in a way that we just totally cannot conceive, when you get it to 6.3 billion and the growth in the world's population.	所以对事物的接受速度 也将变的越来越快 我们无法用语言来表达 当全世界有63亿人的时候 全球的人口在增长
The next thing is that, however we design this stuff -- carefully design this stuff -- the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate, as long as it meets base needs -- the ability to transcend space and time, for example.	无论我们怎样想方设法设计这东西 非常小心谨慎的设计这东西 在街头混的小子们会把它弄个明白再做出新的创新 只要能与他们基本需求温和 举个例子，拥有穿越时间与空间的本领
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.	他们会做我们根本无法预期的不同创新
In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.	他们甚至能比我们做的更好
That's my feeling.	至少我是这样认为的
And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on, and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design.	如果我们够聪明的话，我们会关注这些东西的发展趋势 我们会找到一种方法来使其发扬光大 关于设计和怎样设计
And the last thing is that -- actually, the direction of the conversation.	最后一点， 就是这次谈论的重点
With another three billion people connected, they want to be part of the conversation.	当3亿人被联系到了一起 他们也希望参与交流
And I think our relevance and TED's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.	我认为我们和TED的主旨 最根本是接受并学习怎么去聆听
And we need to learn how to listen.	我们需要学习怎么聆听
So thank you very, very much.	所以非常非常感谢你们今天的参与
I write about food.	我的工作是写关于食物和烹饪的文章。
I take it quite seriously, but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two.	 但是现在我要谈论 一些在近一两年里对我们愈发重要的事情。
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.	这就是饮食的问题，但本质上并不和烹饪相关。
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.	下面我先展示一幅美丽的母牛的照片。
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?	我并不是一名素食主义者 -- 这听上去象以前尼克松的用语，不是吗？
But I still think that this -- -- may be this year's version of this.	但我仍然认为这 -- -- 可能是现在的情况。
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.	只不过现在有一点夸张罢了。
And why do I say it?	为什么我要说这些呢？
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined.	因为以前只发生过一次，每个人的命运 和整个人类的命运 如此紧密得连结在一起。
There was the bomb, and there's now.	过去是原子弹，现在也同样发生了这种情况。
And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives, but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now, we'd recognize it.	并且我们现在要决定的 不仅是我们每个人的生活质量和寿命， 而且是如果在一个世纪之后评价现在的世界， 我们是否会认同它。
It's a holocaust of a different kind, and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.	这是一次不同类型的浩劫， 并且逃避并不能解决任何问题。
Start with the notion that global warming is not only real, but dangerous.	现在全球变暖的现象 不仅是真实的，而且非常危险。
Since every scientist in the world now believes this, and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to, we can take this is a given.	因为现在世界上的每一个科学家都对此表示认同， 并且甚至布什总统都表示认同，当然也可能是假装的， 我们必须要面对它。
Then hear this, please.	现在请听我说。
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases.	畜牧业是仅次于能源生产的第二大制造者 产生改变气候的气体。
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production -- more than transportation.	将近全部温室气体的五分之一 是由畜牧业产生的 -- 比运输业还要多。
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts, but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2, and it's not just methane.	现在你可以尽情地开有关牛屁的玩笑， 但是甲烷的有害程度是二氧化碳的20倍， 而且这其中不仅仅包含甲烷。
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation, air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.	畜牧业又是造成土地退化的最大元凶 空气和水污染，水资源短缺和生物多样性遭到破坏。
There's more.	诸如此类还有许多。
Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people, but to animals.	这就好像国家里一半的抗生素 不是用在人类，而是用在动物身上的。
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this: if you're a progressive, if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green, or you're looking for organic, you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.	但是我罗列的这些听上去只是一串数字，所以让我换一种方式表述， 如果你比较激进， 如果你驾驶一辆普锐斯，或者你购买绿色食品， 或者购买有机食品， 你很可能是一个半素食主义者。
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom, but it's all in the way we use these things.	现在我对母牛的反对比对原子弹的反对更甚， 但是这正是我们现在的生活方式。
There's another piece of the puzzle, which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday, and one you already know.	这里还有另外一个问题 安·库珀在昨天曾经很完美得探讨过， 并且你们已经知道了。
There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world.	这些都不是问题 -- 都不是 -- 所谓的生活方式的疾病 -- 糖尿病，心脏病，中风，几种癌症 -- 这些疾病在这里是过分普遍了 相比世界的其他地方。
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.	这就是西方饮食的直接结果。
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day -- our demand for these things, not our need, our want, drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.	我们对于肉类，乳类和纯净的碳水化合物的需求 -- 世界平均每天消耗十亿听或瓶的可乐 -- 我们对于这些东西的需求并不是必须的，而是我们想要的 -- 使我们消耗了比最佳摄入量更多的卡路里。
And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.	这些在食品中的卡路里导致，而不是预防疾病。
Now global warming was unforeseen.	现在世界变暖还是不可预期的。
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.	我们尚不确定污染除了降低能见度外还有其他什么危害。
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there, but, you know, that's not such a big deal.	可能会在这里或那里造成更多的肺癌， 但是你知道，这并不是一件很严重的事情。
The current health crisis, however, is a little more the work of the evil empire.	可是，现在的健康问题， 比一个邪恶帝国的危害还要严重。
We were told, we were assured, that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate, the healthier we'd be.	我们被告知，并且我们确信， 随着我们摄入更多的肉类，乳类和家禽类食品， 我们会变得更健康。
No.	这是错的。
Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food, is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.	对动物的过度食用，当然还有垃圾食品， 是问题所在，还有对植物类食品的摄入不足。
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear -- it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.	现在不是讨论使用植物是否有益的时候了， 有证据表明植物 -- 我想要强调一下 -- 而不是植物中的成分，是植物本身。
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.	不是β胡萝卜素，而是胡萝卜本身。
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.	有充分证据表明植物可以改善健康状况。
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.	现在这种证据更加充分。
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.	你吃了更多的植物，更少的其他食物，你就会更加长寿。
Not bad.	这算是个还不错的消息。
But back to animals and junk food.	但是问题又回到了动物和垃圾食品。
What do they have in common?	它们有什么共同的特点呢？
One: we don't need either of them for health.	第一：我们为了健康并不需要它们中的任何一个。
We don't need animal products, and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.	我们并不需要动物制品， 而且我们完全不需要白面包或可乐。
Two: both have been marketed heavily, creating unnatural demand.	第二：这两种东西都在被广泛地推销， 导致了不正常的需求。
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.	我们并不是在耸人听闻。
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.	第三：它们的制造得到政府部门的支持， 但是以少食用更健康和环保的食品为代价。
Now, let's imagine a parallel.	现在打个比方。
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy, while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy, knowing all the while that the result would be pollution, war and rising costs.	如果我们的政府支持一个石油公司 同时反对更加可持续发展的能源， 并且知道这将导致 污染，战争和更高的成本。
Incredible, isn't it?	很不可思议，不是吗？
Yet they do that.	但是现在他们正在这样做。
And they do this here.	他们对食品也是如此。
It's the same deal.	这是同样的事情。
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail.	坏消息是，对于饮食问题， 就算是联邦政府用心 去规范我们的行为，也是徒劳的。
Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness, or they are puppets of agribusiness.	他们或者会被从事农产品业的傀儡们投否决票， 或者他们本身就从事于农产品业的傀儡。
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs.	所以当美国农业部最终承认 是植物，而不是动物，使得人们更加健康， 他们建议我们，通过参照他们构建的过于简陋的食品金字塔， 一天吃五份的水果和蔬菜， 和更多的碳水化合物。
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others, and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food.	但是他们没有告诉我们有些碳水化合物比其他的更好， 并且这些植物和全谷类食物 应当替代垃圾食品。
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.	但是工业界的说客不会让这一切发生。
And guess what?	猜猜为什么？
Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness.	制定食品金字塔中一半的人 与农产品业有关联。
So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.	所以并没有用植物替代动物， 我们已经膨胀的胃口变得更大了， 并且其中最危险的部分仍未改变。
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets -- these are not solutions.	所谓的低脂肪和低碳水化合物食品 -- 这些并不是解决方案。
But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local, or whether we're being nice to animals, the most important issues just aren't being addressed.	但是许多有智慧的人 研究某种食物是否有机或本地生产， 或者我们是否要友善地对待动物， 最重要的问题却并没有被涉及。
Now, don't get me wrong.	现在，不要误会我。
I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches.	我喜爱动物， 并且我并不认为应当将动物制品产业化 干扰动物的生活。
But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.	但是现在根本无法善待动物 当一年要屠杀100亿头动物的时候。
That's our number.	这是我们的数字。
10 billion.	100亿。
If you strung all of them -- chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon, they'd go there and back five times, there and back.	如果你将它们连接起来 -- 鸡，牛，猪和羊 -- 到月球， 长度可以来回5次 -- 过去然后回来。
Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good, and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long, but you get the idea.	现在，尽管我的数学不是很好，但这个数字大致是没问题的， 尽管基于一头猪的长度是4英尺还是5英尺， 但是你可以有一个大致的概念。
That's just the United States.	这仅仅是对于美国的情况而言。
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease, kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.	并且随着我们对于这些动物的过度消耗 产生温室气体和心脏疾病， 仁慈可能仅仅是一种逃避的方式。
Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down, and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.	让我们降低被屠杀的动物的数量， 然后我们再去想如何善待幸存的动物。
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore," which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.	另外一个误区的典型代表是土食主义， 刚被新牛津美国词典提名为年度单词。
Seriously.	很严肃的话题。
And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.	土食主义者，对于你们之中不了解的人来说， 是一些只吃当地生产的食品的人。 当你居住在加利福尼亚州时这很好， 但是对于其他地区的人来说这是一个悲哀的玩笑。
Between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision, you have two versions of how to improve our eating.	在官方的故事 -- 饮食金字塔 -- 和前卫的土食主义文化， 你有两个可以改善饮食的选择。
They both get it wrong, though.	但是这两种方式都错了。

We need to start acting.	我们需要开始行动了。
And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said -- and, of course, she's completely right -- but it's also one of global survival.	这就像安·库珀所说的，并不仅仅是一个有关社会正义感的问题 -- 当然她是完全正确的 -- 而且也是有关整体存亡的问题。
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue, the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.	我们回到问题的关键， 对于肉类和垃圾食品的过度制造和过度消耗。
As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production.	就像我说的，百分之十八的温室气体 由畜牧业产生。
How much livestock do you need to produce this?	需要多少资源产生这些量呢？
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth, 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat.	地球上百分之七十的可耕种土地。 地表上百分之三十的面积都直接或间接地用在 饲养我们所吃的动物上。

And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.	我想说的是一个在一生中吃适量的谷物产生的牛肉的男人。
The most common argument is that we need nutrients -- even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.	最多的借口是我们需要汲取营养 -- 即便我们平均食用了两倍的 和工业紧密联系的美国农业部的建议摄入量。
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.	但是请听 -- 专注于减少疾病的专家们 建议成人每周吃半磅多一点的肉类。
What do you think we eat per day?	我们现在每天吃多少？

Some of us might think that would be a good thing.	我们当中的有些人可能认为这会是一件好事情。
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players, the answer is no.	但不是这样，即使我们都是需要激烈运动的橄榄球运动员， 答案也是否定的。
In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth, and many will make you much healthier than ours does.	实际上，地球上没有任何饮食能够满足 基本的营养需求而不会有助于成长， 同时许多会使我们变得比现在更健康。
We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition, we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.	我们并不需要动物制品来获得足够的营养， 我们过多食用它们只会变得营养不良，并且减少我们的寿命。
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat 50 percent less meat -- it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.	建议为了个人和整个人类的健康 美国人少吃一半的肉类 -- 这尽管并不是足够的削减，但是一个崭新的开始。
It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen, and what progressive people, forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating, along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.	尽管这看起来很荒唐，但这却真真切切是现在应该发生的事， 和激进的，前卫的人们 应当做和倡导的事， 和相应更多地食用植物。
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.	我一直是比较随意地写些关于食物的文章 -- 就是这个样子 -- 大概有30年了。
During that time, I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything.	在这其间， 我吃 并且建议吃几乎所有的东西时。
I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure, but I do think that for the benefit of everyone, the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly.	我确信我以后并不会停止吃动物食品， 但是我想为了每个人的利益， 现在是时候停止将动物产业化饲养 并且停止随意地食用它们。
Ann Cooper's right.	安·库珀是正确的。
The USDA is not our ally here.	在这方面美国农业部并不是我们的同盟。
We have to take matters into our own hands, not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone -- and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.	我们需要去自己把握， 不仅仅是向每个人提倡一种更好的饮食 -- 这是很困难的 -- 并且改善我们自己的饮食。
And that happens to be quite easy.	这个可以很容易实现。

I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.	我是戴维•汉 森，我设计具有人格的机器人。
And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you.	我指的是， 我研制出的机器 人具有个性， 也是个最终 会跟你产生共 鸣的机器人。
So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are, and build a relationship with you.	所以我们从许 多不同的科技开始， 这些科技造就 了具人格并懂得对话的机器人， 它们看得到 脸，也会跟你有眼神上的交流， 还会做许多种 脸部表情，也懂得对话， 并且开始仿效 你的感觉， 了解你是谁， 并与你建立关系。
I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.	我发展了一系 列的科技， 让机器人做出 栩栩如生的脸部表情， 比起先前类似 的成果，耗能很低， 这造就了第一 代的人型机器人，两只脚的机器人。
So, it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight.	这个机器人有 着相当多的脸部表情， 仿效着人类脸 上的所有主要肌肉， 可以靠很小的 电池运作， 极度轻薄。
The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen.	让这电池驱动 的脸部表情成真的材料， 是我们叫作 Frubber 的材料， 这材料有着三 种主要创新， 让这项科技得 以实现。

And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.	人们却耗费 数十亿元在那上头。
Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy.	我们可以用 情感机器人做个开端， 使未来机器 人真的能具有同理心。

You start to believe that it's alive and aware.	你开始相信 机器人是有生命并有意识的。
So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"	所以我最喜 欢的主题之一，就是把这些结合起来， 用一种艺术 性的展示， 秀出科幻小 说作家菲利普•狄克笔下的机器人， 他曾写出像 《机器人是否会梦见机器羊？》这样精采的作品，
which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."	电影《银翼 杀手》就是基于这部小说
In these stories, robots often think that they're human, and they sort of come to life.	在这些故事 里，机器人常常会觉得 他们是人 类。而且他们总是会获得生命。
So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.	所以我们把 他的作品、信件、 他的访问、 书函， 集结成上千 页的数据库， 接着再用一 些自然的语言处理， 让你真的可 以和他对话。
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.	这还真的有 点吓人。因为他会说些事， 就好像它们 真的懂你。
And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.	这正是我们 在发展最令人兴奋的计划之一， 这是个小角 色，一个小机器人， 目的是研发 友善的人工智能，友善的机械智能。

I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.	我开始阅读《科学美国人》杂志中 Martin Gardner的专栏。
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.	我一直坚持并且最后决定将此作为自己的事业。
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?	现在， 让我稍作停顿， 并且解释一下， 到底什么是游戏呢？
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer.	益智游戏是一种有问题，有正确答案 而且，我们会从探索解决方法的过程中，获得乐趣的游戏。
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems, which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.	这样的有乐趣的解决问题与我们日常生活中遇到的问题不同， 我们生活中碰到的那些问题， 坦率的讲，设计的太粗糙啦。
You know, they might have a solution.	那些生活问题， 或许会有个解决方案。
It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.	但找到那个方法或许很费时间， 也没人能清楚的告诉我们应该怎么做。
Who designed this?	到底是谁给我们设计了那么多生活难题？
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies.	这就像我们说的， 生活是一个蹩脚的小说， 所以，我们得雇人写电影剧本。
Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.	我所做的，就是从日常生活的那些问题中获得灵感，再将他们设计成小游戏。
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer; many puzzles have more than one.	这些小游戏， 有正确答案， 而且可能还不止一个。 许多小游戏， 都不止一个答案。
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games -- by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.	但相对于其他形式的娱乐 比如玩具和竞赛， 玩玩具，我的意思是，你在玩玩具时并不抱有任何特别的目的。
You can create one out of Legos.	你可以用乐高创造你自己的玩具。
Or competitive games like chess where, well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle, but the goal really is to beat another player.	 我们下棋并不是解决某个问题。 当然， 我们可以搞个棋类游戏。
It goes back as long as there is written history.	这种古老的艺术， 从人类有书写史的时候就开始有了。
It's a very small form, like a joke, a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.	游戏可以很短小， 比方一个小玩笑 也可以是一句诗歌，一个小魔术，一首诗，结构紧凑。
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.	最差的游戏，也不过是被扔掉了，他们就是为了娱乐而生的。
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression.	但最好的游戏却能深入人心， 让人难以忘怀。
The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.	我的职业发展，你们可以看到 就是设计出让人难以忘怀的游戏来。

Slide into the shimmering surface between two worlds. And no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear. If I could be anywhere, if I could be anywhere, if I could be anywhere in history, I would want to be here. The Romans, the Spanish the British, the Dutch, American exceptionalism, so out of touch. The folly of empire repeating its course, imposing its will and ruling by force on and on through time. Thank you.	慢慢陷入那微微发光的表面 恍如两个世界 站在时光中间 看着它无限延展 透过幻觉的面纱 抛开过去的论断 不知能否解开我的困惑 如果我能到任何地方 如果我能到任何地方 如果我此刻能到任何地方 这里便是我愿去的地方 在我们抛弃的事物中 寻找未来 试着透过我们每天 产生废弃物来看这个世界 都说没有什么可以永远 但塑料垃圾却一直存在着 在怎么闭上我们的双眼 也无法让它消失 如果我能去任何地方 如果我能去任何地方 如果我能穿越时空，到达任何地方 这里便是我愿去的地方 罗马人，西班牙人 英国人，荷兰人 美国例外，所以我们不谈 荒唐的故事还在一遍遍上演 强加意愿 暴力统治 不断上演 但我们的世界已无法承受 除非我们能更加聪明强大 否则我们将无法幸免 世界将通过它的方式 摆脱我们的贪婪 如果我能去任何地方 如果我能立刻到达任何地方 如果我能去任何地方，改变些什么 我必须立刻启程 都说没有什么可以永远 但塑料垃圾却一直存在着 即使你闭上双眼 也无法让它少一点点 我们的世界 已无法承受多久 除非我们能更加聪明强大 否则我们将无法幸免 世界将通过它的方式 摆脱我们的贪婪 你会看到我们的世界已无法承受 如果海洋都束手无策，我们也将无法拯救 世界将通过它的方式 摆脱我们的贪婪 如果我能去任何地方 如果我能立刻到达任何地方 如果我能去任何地方，改变结果 我必须立刻启程 谢谢。
If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large, urban areas like New York City.	假若你今天有幸来此--我对你的到来亦是甚喜－－ 你们一定听说过可持续发展可以拯救我们的生活 然而，我们不在TED的时候 我们一定听说现实中的可持续发展议程并没有可行性 特别是在大的城市，比如纽约
And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.	这是因为大多数的决策者们 不管是公共还是私人部门 都没有真的意识到他们正处于危险境地
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog: an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.	我今天之所以在此，其中一个原因，是因为一只狗 是我在1998年在雨中捡到的被遗弃的小狗
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.	它已经长成了一只大狗，比我想象的要大
When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront, despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week.	它刚刚来的时候，我们正在抗议计划建于东河海滨的巨型垃圾处理场 尽管事实上我们这个区域 已经处理了整个纽约市超过40%的商业垃圾 一个废水处理球团矿厂、一个污泥处理厂，四个发电厂， 世界上最大的食品分销中心 还有其他行业每周有超过6万辆的柴油车开到这里
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.	这里也是纽约市公园占地率最低的地区
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.	所以，当公园管理处联系到我 用1万美元的种子启动资金来开发海滨时 我觉得这确实是善举，但是有些天真
I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities that I'd mentioned earlier.	我一生都住在这个地区，但是却不能到河里去 都是因为我先前提到的那些垃圾处理厂
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.	一天早上，我和我的狗去慢跑 她拖着我往河里走，我想这仅仅是又一次非法的倾倒垃圾
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me -- and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.	到处都是野草和成堆的垃圾以及其他的东西，这里我就不想说了 但是，她一直拖着我——啊，瞧瞧，在垃圾的尽头就是河流啊
I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.	我知道这条被遗忘的死胡同 就像是拽我到这里的这条狗一样，被遗弃了，而且是值得拯救的
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.	而且我也知道这将是令人自豪的开始 有社区发起的使新South Bronx焕发生机
And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.	就像我的狗一样，这个主意比我预想的要博大得多。
We garnered much support along the way.	一路上我们得到了很多的支持
And the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.	而且Hunts Point海滨公园成了South Bronx六十年以来的 第一个海滨公园
We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $3 million park.	我们的一万元的启动资金，增加了超过300倍，变成了一个价值300万的公园
And, in the fall, I'm actually going to -- I exchange marriage vows with my beloved.	而且，这个秋天，我实际上打算—— 和我心爱的人结婚。
Thank you very much.	谢谢大家

But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coalmine.	但是，我们这些生活在环境正义社区里的人们 就像是煤矿中金丝雀。
We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.	我们现在发现的这个问题，其实已经存在好久了

Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities.	不幸的是，种族和阶级成了最可靠的指示剂 就像是哪里能找到好的东西，如公园和树 哪里能找到不好的东西，比如发电厂和垃圾处理厂

I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility -- which I do.	我有五倍高于白人的可能性会居住在 离发电厂和化工厂近在咫尺的地方——而且确实如此

Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe.	这些都可以用来替代石油为主的屋顶材料 后者吸收热量，造成城市的热岛效应，然后在太阳底下 降解成我们呼吸的空气。
Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine.	绿色屋顶也能留住75%的雨水 这也有助于城市减少地下管道设施的高昂支出 这些设施恰好在环境正义的社区就能看到，比如说我居住的社区
And they provide habitats for our little friends!	而且绿色屋顶也给我们的小朋友提供了栖息场所
So -- -- so cool!	所以————相当酷
Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.	总之，这项示范项目是我们的绿色屋顶设施项目的开始 它给South Bronx带来了工作机会和持续的经济活动
I like that, too.	我也喜欢这个
Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: we need investors.	不管怎样，我知道Chris告诉我们不要再上面做修改 但是我们必须引起你们的注意：我们需要投资。
End of pitch.	修改完之后
Anyway -- OK. Katrina.	Katrina。
Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common.	在Katrina之前，South Bronx和新奥尔良的第九区 有太多的相似之处。
Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.	两个地方都居住着大量的贫穷的有色人种 都是文化创新的温床：想想嘻哈乐和爵士
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another.	都是滨海社区，其中工业区 和居民区靠的如此之近
In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.	在后Katrina时代，我们还是有很多相同点
We're at best ignored and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability.	我们被最多的忽略、诽谤和滥用，最糟糕的是 都是由于疏忽的管理机构、有害的分区制和松散的政府责任
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.	无论是对第九区的破坏还是South Bronx都是必然的
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out.	我们提供能解救我们自身的有价值的课程
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight.	而不仅仅是城市萎缩的民族象征
Or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone.	或者是历任总统的空洞的参选承诺来解决问题
Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two like the South Bronx did?	现在我们会让墨西哥沿岸 像South Bronx曾经那样因渴望而苦恼等上几十年吗？
Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?	或者是向草根活动家的自身资源那里学习，主动采取行动 这些草根活动家都是从像我居住的社区一样的地方，在绝望中产生的
Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral.	现在听着，我们并不需要个人 公司或政府来把世界变得更好，仅仅是因为它的正确的或是道德上的
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through, like a tiny little bit.	今天的演讲仅仅代表了我经历的一小部分 很小的一部分。
You've no clue.	你找不到任何线索
But I'll tell you later if you want to know.	但是如果你确实想了解，我待会儿告诉你
But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end.	但是——我知道这是本质，或者是一个人的见解 最后能激励其他人
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line" that sustainable development can produce.	我 感兴趣的是，我所称呼的三重盈利 能产生持续性的发展
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.	发展有可能给所有相关的人带来积极的回报 开发商、政府和项目所在地的社区
At present, that's not happening in New York City.	目前，纽约市还没有实施这个
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit.	我们正面临全面的城市规划财政赤字
A parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space.	针对政府补贴的游行正计划提议在 South Bronx发展大型商场和体育馆 但是，市政部门直接缺乏合作 来应对日益严重的交通、污染、固体废料 和空地的影响的问题。
And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny.	而且他们发展当地经济 工作机会的方式如此跛脚，而不仅仅是好笑那么简单
Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks.	因为，还有一个例子，世界上最富有的运动团体为了修建贝比鲁斯之屋 而毁掉了两个非常好的社区公园
Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.	现在，我们也只有少于先前提供给你们的数据
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit.	尽管只有少于25%的South Bronx居民有用私车 这些项目还是包括了成千上万新的车位 仅仅是给庞大的交通系统提供一点活力
Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.	现在，从大的争论中遗失的是一个全面的 成本收益分析，不是为了修复一个不健康的 危害环境的社区，而是一个合作的 建设性的，可持续性的改变
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.	我的机构和哥伦比亚大学和其他机构密切合作 来在这些问题上指明出路
Now let's get this straight.	现在，让我澄清一下。
I am not anti-development.	我并不是一个反对发展的人
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist.	我们居住的是一个城市，而不是一个野生动物保护区。而且我信奉资本主义
You probably all have it, and if you haven't, you need to.	而且你们可能也是，如果你不是的，那你需要那样做
So I don't have a problem with developers making money.	所以我对 开发商挣钱没有任何异议
There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune.	而且先前有足够多的例子显示可持续发展的 帮助社区发展的开发是可以挣到很多钱的
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that.	TED的朋友Bill Mcdonough和Amory Lovins 都是这方面的楷模——都展示了你确实能在这里挣到钱
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit.	但我对于那些去在政治弱势群体身上盈利 的开发商确实是有异议的
This is my version of globalization.	这是我的全球化设想
Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking: a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.	让我们看看波哥大，一个平穷的拉丁语地区，到处都是枪支犯罪 和毒品走私：跟South Bronx的名声差不多
However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Penalosa.	然而，这个城市在二十世纪90年代受惠于 一个高度有影响力的市长，名叫Enrique Penalosa
He looked at the demographics.	他查看了人口统计资料
Few Bogatanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.	很少的波哥大人拥有汽车，但是很大比例的城市资源是专为他们服务的
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.	如果你是市长，你当然能做一些事情
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world.	他把主要的市内车道从五车道变成了三车道 禁止在这些街道停车，扩宽人行道 和自行车道，修建公共广场 创建了世界上最高效的公共汽车交通系统
For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached.	由于他出色的政绩，她差点被调查
But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened.	但是人们开始发现他们开始把日常生活中的事情 放在第一位，不可思议的事情发生了
People stopped littering; crime rates dropped -- because the streets were alive with people.	人们不再乱扔垃圾。犯罪率下降了。 街道因为大家而生机勃勃

We have no excuse in this country.	我们在这样一个国家没有任何借口。
I'm sorry.	对不起
But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather to provide opportunities for all Bogatanos to participate in the city's resurgence.	但是实质是，他们人民的首要议程不是 惩罚那些拥有车辆的人 而是让所有的波哥大人参与进来 让城市恢复活力。
That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the US.	发展不应该以牺牲 大多数人的利益为代价。这也是美国人民普遍认可的观点
But Bogota's example has the power to change that.	但是波哥大的例子有能力去改变它
You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence.	然而，你受益于影响的恩惠

Ciao bellos!	再见
So it was about four years ago, five years ago, I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was, with a bag similar to this.	大概在四五年前， 我应该坐在费城的一个舞台上， 身边有一个像这样的包。
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.	我从这个包里掏出一个分子，
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well, but your body knows it extremely well.	说，你很不了解这个分子。 但是你的身体却非常了解它。
And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time, because we are very immune to this.	同时我也在想你的身体对之十分痛恨。
This is called alpha-gal epitope.	这被称为alpha-gal抗原决定基。
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.	事实上猪的心脏瓣膜里有很多这种分子， 也正因为此，你很难把猪的心脏瓣膜移植到人体上。
Actually our body doesn't hate these.	实际上我们的身体并不痛恨它们。
Our body loves these. It eats them.	我们的身体喜欢这些食物，它会吃掉它们。
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.	我的意思是说，我们免疫系统中的细胞总是处于饥饿状态。
And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell, it means "that's food."	一旦抗体碰到这些东西， 就意味着，找到食物了。
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.	正如你所知的， 我们让免疫系统对这个奇怪的分子产生了反应， 而这个分子并不是我们做的，我们能在其他动物和物体上看到这样的物质。
But I said we can't get rid of it, because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity.	但是我也说过我们无法避免这种免疫活动。 因为所有试图移植心脏瓣膜的人， 最终都发现他们没法摆脱这个免疫系统。
And I said, why don't you use that?	那么我说，为什么不利用它呢？
What if I could stick this molecule, slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?	假如我把这个分子， 植入到一个细菌上， 而这个细菌恰恰是正在侵略我肺部的病原体呢？
I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there, where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.	这样，我就能立即进入 一个早已准备好的免疫状态了。 而不是像以前那样需要五六天的时间来慢慢发展自己的免疫系统。 用这个方法，我们可以对当前的病原体立即发动攻击了。
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you, like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A., and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car, and then charges you for possession of marijuana.	打个比方来说， 你在洛杉矶碰上了交通堵塞， 警察在你汽车的后备箱放了一麻袋毒品， 并指控你非法拥有毒品。
It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.	这其实是一种非常快非常有效的，让人们迅速离开这条街的方法。
So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street.	所以你可以取出一个细胞， 这对事情没有任何影响。 但如果你能成功的在细胞上加上这个分子， 你就能把它从大街上甩掉了。
And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.	对于一些细菌， 我们没有其他有效的方法来抵抗了。
Our antibiotics are running out.	我们的抗生素正在被用尽。
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.	我是说，整个世界都在用尽。
So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won't be here.	有可能50年后这已经不是一个问题了， 链球菌会肆虐， 假如今天我们没有在这的话。
But if we are -- we're going to need something to do with the bacteria.	但是如果我们在—— 我们需要一些东西对抗细菌。
So I started working with this thing, with a bunch of collaborators.	所以我已经开始着手这项工作， 和一群合作者们。
And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones, bacteria that we don't like.	并且尝试着把它附着到 那些本身也附着于某些领域的东西上， 例如对我们有害的细菌。
And I feel now like George Bush.	我现在就像乔治·布什。
It's like "mission accomplished."	就如任务完成一样。
So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.	也许我现在做的事情有点蠢，就像他当时做的那样。
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.	但基本上我在讨论我们将要做的事情。
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.	也就是，杀死病毒，让抗体系统吃掉它们。
This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there, sort of symbolizing this right now.	这件事也许会受到阻碍，就像那边那个绿色小三角一样, 有点像现在的情况。
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.	你可以把它附着到一种叫做DNA适体的东西上。
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.	然后那个DNA适体会专一的附着到 你选择的目标上。
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.	因此你可以在细菌上找一个你不喜欢的特性， 比如菌尿，我特别不喜欢它， 因为去年我的一名教授朋友因它而死。
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.	抗生素对它没效果，所以我不喜欢它。
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.	于是我制作了一种可以附着在这上面的适体。
That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body, and will alert your immune system to go after it.	它知道怎么在你的体内找到菌尿， 然后报警，让你的免疫系统去搞定它。
Here's what happened.	我们的测试是这样的。
See that line on the very top with the little dots?	 看到最上面那条由小点构成的线了吗？
That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas, at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.	那是一群被毒害了的老鼠， 由处于德克萨斯州的科学家朋友们， 用炭疽杆菌下的毒。
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular, and direct your immune system to it.	接着我们对他们使用了我们制作的药物， 它可以一种特殊方式攻击炭疽杆菌， 并引到免疫系统去攻击它。
You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line -- that's a 100 percent survival rate.	你会发现最上面一排还都活着。 百分之百的存活率。
And they actually lived another 14 days, or 28 when we finally killed them, and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.	事实上它们接下来又存活了14天， 或者28天，直至我们最后杀死了它们， 并解剖它们，分析到底哪里出了问题。
Why did they not die?	它们为什么没有死呢？
And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.	因为它们不再有任何炭疽杆菌了。
So we did it.	所以说，我们成功了。
Okay?	对吧？
Mission accomplished!	任务完成！
I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960.	我仍然记得我还在上学的时候 老师告诉我们 世界的人口总数已经达到了 30亿人口。 那还是在1960年。
This box contains one billion people.	这个箱子包含十亿人口。
And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people.	我的老师告诉我 在工业化的世界，1960年， 有十个亿的人口。
In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people.	在发展中的国家，她说道， 有两亿人口
And they lived away then.	而且他们的生活相对隔离。
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world.	在10亿的工业化世界 和20亿的发展中世界 有一个巨大的鸿沟。
In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families.	在工业化世界， 人们健康， 良好教育，富有， 并且有较小的家庭。
And their aspiration was to buy a car.	他们的心愿 就是买辆车。
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this.	在1960年，整个瑞典都在存钱 去买一辆像这样的沃尔沃。
This was the economic level at which Sweden was.	这就是当时瑞典的经济水平。
But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day.	但是相对的， 在遥远的发展中国家， 中等家庭的愿望则是 每天能够有食物。
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes.	而他们存钱 是想买一双鞋。
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up.	在我所长大的世界里 是有一个巨大的鸿沟。
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about "the West" and "the Developing World."	这个在西方世界和其他国家的鸿沟 所创造的世界观 就是我们今天口头上 提到西方世界 和发展中国家。
But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.	但是世界已经变化了， 是时候去升级这个世界观了， 去对世界分类，以及了解这个分类。
And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population.	这就是我将要向你们展示的。 因为自从1960年 到2010年间，所发生的是 一个惊人 的四十亿人口 加入到了世界人口中。
Just look how many.	看看有多少。
The world population has doubled since I went to school.	从我上学到现在 世界人口已经翻倍了。
And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.	而且当然的，西方的经济也增长了。
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here.	很多公司的经济都增长了， 所以西方的人口就移动到这。
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.	现在人们所想的不是买辆车。
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly.	现在他们想买的是一个在遥远地方的假期 而且要飞去。
So this is where they are today.	所以他们现在在这。
And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them.	然而这里最成功的发展中国家， 他们也移动了，你知道的。 他们成了我们口中的新兴经济体。
They are now buying cars.	现在他们也买车了。
And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world.	而且就在一个月以前 一个叫做吉利的中国公司 收购了沃尔沃公司。 这样瑞典在终于意识到 世界发生了一些大的变化。
So there they are.	所以他们现在在这。
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago.	悲惨是，在这里的二十亿 还在为食物和鞋子挣扎， 他们仍然和50年前 一样的贫穷。
The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have.	区别就在 我们有最多的30个亿在这里， 正在成为新兴经济体， 因为他们颇为健康，相对受过教育， 他们也有两到三个小孩 平均每个妇女。
And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.	他们现在的愿望是 显然的，买一辆自行车， 他们过一段时间还会想要摩托车。
But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap.	但是这就是 我们现在所有的世界。 没有鸿沟。
But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever.	但是贫穷的还是非常贫穷， 和富有的相比，差距更大了。
But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.	但是这是一个渐变的世界 从走路，自行车， 到汽车，到飞行 所有水准都有。 大多数人是在这中间。
This is the new world we have today in 2010.	这是我们在2010的 世界。
And what will happen in the future?	那未来会发生什么？
Well, I'm going to project into 2050.	好的，我现在要穿越到 2050年。
I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did.	我最近在上海。 我也听到了中国所发生的事情。 显然他们会像日本一样 迎头赶上。
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent.	未来--这个会长 一到两个百分比。
[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.	这个会长7，8个。他们会前进到这里。
They will start flying.	他们也会开始常坐飞机。
And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically.	而这些 中低收入国家，新兴经济体国家， 他们会在经济上进一步增长。
And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here.	如果 但是只有如果 我们投入到正确的绿色科技 -- 我们才能避免严重的气候变化， 能源才能相对的便宜 -- 这样他们才会都移到这里来。
And they will start to buy electric cars.	他们才会开始购买 电子汽车。
This is what we will find there.	这就是我们在这里发现的。
So what about the poorest two billion?	那么最贫穷的那20亿呢？
What about the poorest two billion here?	最贫穷的20亿会怎么样呢？
Will they move on?	他们会怎样移动呢？
Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end.	好吧，这里人口会先增加 因为每个妇女平均有2到3个小孩， 家庭计划会被普遍采用， 人口增长会走到尽头。
Here [among the poorest], population is growing.	这里，人口增长。
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion.	所以这两亿，在下面的几十年里， 会增长到30亿。 然后会继续 增长到40亿。
There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening.	任何事情 除非有一个我们都没有见过的核战争 才能阻止这个增长。
Because we already have this [growth] in process.	因为我们已经在这个进程中了。
But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050.	但是如果，只有如果 他们能脱离贫穷， 他们能受教育，能提高儿童成活率， 他们才能买自行车，手机，他们会移动到这儿来， 然后人口增长 会在2050停止。
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth.	我们不能让这些人在这个水准 还在寻找食物和鞋子， 因为那样我们的人口会继续增长。

And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.	这里，儿童存活率， 每个儿童存活的百分比 一直到学龄前儿童。 60%，70%，80%，90%， 以及几乎100%，就跟现今 在最富有和最健康的国家里一样。
But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival.	看，这就是我老师口中的1960年的世界。 西方国家一个亿， 高儿童存活率，小家庭。 和所有其他， 其他五彩斑斓的发展中国家， 都有大的家庭 和很低的儿童存活率。

Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here?	你可以看到那最贫穷的十亿， 那些那边的箱子？
They are still up here.	他们还在那里。
And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation.	他们的儿童存活率还是 70%到80%。 也就是说，如果你有6个小孩， 最后只有4个能存活 变成下一代。
And the population will double in one generation.	而且人口会在下一代翻倍。
So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent.	所以能阻止 世界人口增长 的唯一办法是提高儿童存活率 到90%。
That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world.	那就是为什么盖茨的基金， 儿童基金会和急救机构 和贫穷国家的国家政府 是很好的组织。 因为他们实际上 在帮助我们 达到一个能持续发展的人口数。
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.	我们可以停在90个亿，如果我们能做正确的事情。
Child survival is the new green.	儿童存活率是一个崭新的梦想。

I would love to share with you a story.	让我来给你们讲个故事
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.	很久很久以前 19世纪的德国 有本书
Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling.	那时候 这是故事书中的王者
It was venerable.	故事书很珍贵
It was ubiquitous.	但又无处不在
But it was a little bit boring.	又有点无趣
Because in its 400 years of existence, storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device.	因为在有故事书的四百年里 讲故事的人们从来没有 改良故事书作为辅助设备
But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever.	后来有个作家 他永远地改写了历史
His name was Lothar, Lothar Meggendorfer.	他叫罗萨 罗萨･梅根多尔弗尔
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, and he said, "Genug ist genug!"	罗萨･梅根多尔弗尔下了决心 他说：我受够了！
He grabbed his pen, he snatched his scissors.	他抓起笔 抄起剪刀
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold.	他决意不走寻常路 他折起了纸
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book.	历史上的罗萨･梅根多尔弗尔 作为什么人被记载下来？ 世界上第一个 为孩子发明立体书的人
For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced.	人们享受着 这喜悦和惊奇
They were happy because the story survived, and that the world would keep on spinning.	（欢呼） 他们很高兴故事保存下来 世界继续转动
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last.	罗萨･梅根多尔弗尔不是第一个 改进讲故事方法的人 也不会是最后一个
Whether storytellers realized it or not, they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville, radio news to radio theater, film to film in motion to film in sound, color, 3D, on VHS and on DVD.	不管讲故事的人是否意识到 当他们 从歌剧到杂技 从电台新闻到电台剧院 从影像到电影 到有声电影，彩色电影和3D电影 从家用录像到DVD 他们都是在传承梅根多尔弗尔的精神
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.	没有什么能阻止梅根多尔弗尔的精神
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.	互联网的问世则带来了更多的乐趣
Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.	因为人们不但可以向世界讲述他们的故事 而且可以 利用各种各样的设备来讲故事
For example, one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine.	比如 有个公司 通过它的搜索引擎 讲述一个爱情故事
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D.	一个台湾工作室 把美国政治做成3D动画
And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.	有个人通过一个叫做推特的平台 讲述他父亲的故事 分享他父亲说的无用废话
And after all this, everyone paused; they took a step back.	在有了这一切之后 人们停下脚步 回望过去
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling, they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.	他们意识到 在六千年讲故事的历史中 他们从在洞穴墙壁上画狩猎图 到在脸书的涂鸦墙上诠释莎士比亚

B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future.	和许多囚犯一样， B.J.有着宏大的未来计划。
He had a vision. When he got out, he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight, and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.	他的愿望是，出狱之后 不再贩毒，坦荡做人 他正在努力将他的两项爱好融合成一项事业。
He'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.	他花了一万美元 购买了一个网站 网站的主要内容是美女在奢侈跑车的上面或者里面做爱。
It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.	那时我进联邦监狱刚刚一周， 但我很快就发现那里的情形和电视上很不一样。
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.	事实上，监狱充满了聪明、野心勃勃的人 六个月之前 作为密苏里州参议院冉冉升起的新星 我和CEO们一起吃饭 进监狱之后，我感觉囚犯们的商业直觉和高管们一样敏锐。
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside, but when they talked about what they did, they talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton: promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user, focus-grouping new product launches, territorial expansion.	我的狱友中95% 都是因为贩毒被捕的， 他们说起自己的过去时 会用到独特的行话 但他们谈到的经商理念 和沃顿商学院工商管理硕士的一年级课程颇为相似： 促销激励，新顾客可以免费试用 针对某一顾客群体的新产品发布， 市场拓展。
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.	他们并没有整天沉浸在对过去光辉岁月的追忆之中。
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.	大多数情况下，他们不过是为了生存而已。
It's a lot harder than you might think.	这可能比你想象的要困难很多。
Contrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life when you're in prison.	和大部分人所想的不同 人民，纳税人是不支付 囚犯在监狱的生活费用的。
You've got to pay for your own life.	你必须自己养活自己。
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.	你必须付钱购买肥皂、除臭剂、 牙刷、牙膏等等。
And it's hard for a couple of reasons.	有几个原因导致在监狱中生存颇为困难。
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you'd pay on the street, and second, you don't make a lot of money.	首先，所有东西的价格都比 市场价高出30%到50%， 第二，你挣得钱不多。
I unloaded trucks.	我为卡车卸货。
That was my full-time job, unloading trucks at a food warehouse, for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.	这是一份全职工作， 在一个食品仓库给卡车卸货 一个月，不是一个小时，赚5.25美元。
So how do you survive?	怎样才能生存呢？
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.	我们必须做买卖，各种各样的买卖。
There's legal hustles.	有合法的买卖。
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.	以邮票为货币买东西。
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.	有偿为狱友打扫牢房。
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.	也有轻微违规的买卖，比如在你的牢房里开个理发店。
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.	违规情节稍微严重一点的是：在牢房里开纹身店。
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be.	也有违规情节非常严重的买卖：从外面偷运 或者请人偷运毒品、色情制品、 手机，和监狱外的商业世界一样 监狱里存在着风险收益的平衡，所以一项生意风险越大 它所能带来的利润可能也越高。
You want a cigarette in prison?	在监狱想买一根香烟？
Three to five dollars.	3到5美元。
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head?	想要翻盖的、 和人脑袋差不多大的手机？
Three hundred bucks.	300美元。
You want a dirty magazine?	想要色情杂志？
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.	那可能要花1000美元。
So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity.	你可能也发现了，灵活的头脑 在监狱生活中非常重要。
Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse, sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers, or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less, and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training businesses.	无论是用从仓库偷来的废料 烹制美味的食物 还是用指甲钳为人做发型 抑或是用挂在树上装满岩石的洗衣袋健身 囚犯们知道如何在物质条件贫乏的条件下生存 很多人也希望能利用自己 在监狱中培养锻炼出的灵活头脑 在出狱之后开餐厅、理发店 或者搞个人健身辅导。
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even.	然而监狱中没有意在帮助囚犯重返社会自力更生的课程 囚犯在监狱中并没有得到真正的改造。 没有人帮助囚犯撰写商业计划， 帮助他们找到把来自直觉的商业理念 转化为合法生意的方法， 囚犯们甚至不能上网。
And then, when they come out, most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background.	随后，出狱之后，很多州 没有禁止 雇主歧视有前科的求职者的法律。
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years.	所以在三分之二的囚犯出狱后 五年之后还会再犯的事实面前 我们根本无需惊讶。
Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.	我对联邦政府撒谎，因此在联邦监狱服刑一年。
But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.	不过，出狱之后，我发誓 尽全力帮助那些 和我的狱友们有相似经历的人们 让他们不要再继续浪费生命。
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.	因此，我希望你们能够考虑伸出援手。
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons, because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.	我们的最佳选择是 想办法扶持监狱中的创业精神 发掘囚犯身上隐藏的巨大潜力 因为如果我们不这么做的话，囚犯们就无法学到 能够帮助他们谋生的新技能，他们还会回到监狱当中。
All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.	而他们在监狱里所能学到的不过是新的骗术而已。
Thank you.	谢谢。

It's good to see you guys.	很高兴见到你们。
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet, and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change.	但是剩下的我们，这是一个全是人的房间， 这些人对这个星球的未来充满热情， 但是甚至我们都不关心 导致气候变暖的能源消耗

This is coal, the most common source of electricity on the planet, and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year.	这是煤炭， 这个星球上最常见的电力能源， 这些煤炭中有足够多的能量， 可以让这个灯泡亮一年还多。
But unfortunately, between here and here, most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat.	不幸的是，在从这里到这里过程中， 这种能量大部分都因为， 传导流失和放热而丢失了。
In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.	事实上，只有10%的能量最后以光能的形式释放。
So this coal will last a little bit more than a month.	所以这块煤炭最多只能够维持一个月多一点。
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year, you'd need this much coal.	如果你想要让这个灯泡照明一年， 你需要这么多煤炭。
The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use, we waste nine.	坏消息是，我们每用一成的能量， 我们就会浪费九成。
That means there's good news, because for every unit of energy we save, we save the other nine.	这也意味着有好消息， 就是我们每节约一成的能量， 我们就节约了剩下的九成。
So the question is, how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we're using, and start wasting less of it?	问题是，我们如何让在这个房间里的人们 以及全世界的人们开始关注 我们所使用的能量， 并且开始减少浪费？

Turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans."	关掉空调， 打开电扇。
The people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing.	 只是因为告知了他们，邻居在做什么。
So what does this tell us?	这告诉我们什么呢？
Well, if something is inconvenient, even if we believe in it, moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us -- but social pressure, that's powerful stuff.	好吧，如果某些事情有些不便， 即使我们相信它， 道德劝说，经济鼓励，并不会让我们行动起来， 但是社会压力，是强悍的。
And harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.	正确地利用的话，它可以成为强大的正能量。
In fact, it already is.	事实上，它已经是了。
Inspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I started a company called Opower.	受此启发，我和我的朋友Dan Yates开始 筹划一个公司，叫Opower。
We built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy.	我们开发软件并且与公共事业公司合作， 这些公司也想要帮助他们的客户节约能源。
We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.	我们发表个性化的家庭能源报导， 向人们展示他们的消耗量 与住房大小相似的邻居比较。
Just like those effective door hangers, we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors, and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save.	就像那些有效的挂在门上的留言条一样， 我们让人们把他们自己与邻居相比， 然后给出目标性的建议。 帮助他们节约。

Two terawatt hours, it's roughly half what the U.S. solar industry produced last year.	两个太瓦小时，大约是去年 美国太阳能工厂年产量的一半。
And two terawatt hours? In terms of coal, we'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity.	两个太瓦小时，换成煤炭的话， 我们需要每分钟燃烧34辆这种独轮手推车的煤炭， 每小时60分钟，每天24小时，每年365天。

I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement, to resonate other people's feelings, thoughts, intentions, motivations, in the act of being with them.	我一直都想成为 社会交往中的一个能活动的实验室 在于他人相处时，理解他们的感受与思想, 意图和动机,从而产生共鸣.
As a scientist, I always wanted to measure that resonance, that sense of the other that happens so quickly, in the blink of an eye.	作为一个科学家,我总想度量这种共鸣的感受 这种感受瞬间产生, 仿佛在眨眼之间.
We intuit other people's feelings.	我们凭直觉理解别人的感受

They didn't talk. But most of all, they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them, from their environment and from the people.	他们不说话. 但最糟糕的是, 他们极度封闭,生活在自己的世界里 与周围的环境隔绝 与人隔绝
In fact, at the time, if you walked into a school for individuals with autism, you'd hear a lot of noise, plenty of commotion, actions, people doing things, but they're always doing things by themselves.	实际上,如果你走进一个为自闭症患者开办的学校 你会听到很多嘈杂的声音 各种喧闹，各种动作， 都在做着些什么 但他们总是各自做各自的事
So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling, or they may be isolated in the corner, or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements, in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere.	有的人可能在看天花板上的一盏灯 有的人可能缩在一个角落里 他们可能不断地重复这些动作 这些自我刺激的动作毫无意义
Extremely, extremely isolated.	他们极度地封闭.
Well, now we know that autism is this disruption, the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you.	现在我们知道了,自闭症是一种功能的混乱 即共鸣功能的混乱， 就是我刚才提到的
These are survival skills.	这些是生存的基本技能
These are survival skills that we inherited over many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.	这些生存技能是我们继承而来的 经由很多很多年的 进化而来的
You see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility.	大家都知道,婴儿生来是很脆弱的
Without the caregiver, they wouldn't survive, so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival.	没有人照顾,他们活不下去 所以很合理地, 大自然赋予他们 一种生存机制.
They orient to the caregiver.	他们会亲近照顾者
From the first days and weeks of life, babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment.	在人们出生后的几天到几周里 婴儿更偏好人的声音 相比环境的声音,他们喜欢人声.
They prefer to look at people rather than at things, and even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes, because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences, so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away.	他们喜欢盯着人看,胜过盯着东西看. 甚至当他们看着人时, 他们会看人的眼睛 因为眼睛就是人生经验的一个窗口 因此他们会更喜欢盯着那些正看着他们的人 而不是那些没有看他们的人
Well, they orient to the caregiver.	他们会亲近照顾他们的人
The caregiver seeks the baby.	而照顾者也会亲近婴儿
And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind, the social mind, the social brain, depends on.	在这种双向互助、一来一往如同舞蹈一样的过程中 对人的思想慢慢形成至关重要的各种因素便产生了 人的社会心理,社会大脑也借此形成.
We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life.	我们总以为自闭症 是后天形成的
It doesn't. It begins with the beginning of life.	其实并非如此. 自闭症在孩子出生的时候就有了.
As babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well, there is something in between the ears that is very important -- it's invisible, you can't see -- but is really critical, and that thing is called attention.	当婴儿和照顾者在一起时, 他们很快便意识到 在两个人的耳朵之间 存在着很重要的东西 这种东西是无形的,你看不见, 但却非常重要 这种东西就是所谓的注意力
And they learn soon enough, even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want.	他们很快就能学会 甚至在他们会开口说话前,他们转移自己的注意力 以得到自己想要的东西
They also learn to follow other people's gaze, because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about.	他们也会跟随着别人的目光 因为人的目光所到之处 就是他们心中所想
And soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things, because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something, they're not just getting a directional cue, they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing, the attitude, and soon enough they start building this body of meanings, but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction.	很快地,他们开始了解事物的意义 因为当某个人看着一个东西 或指着一个东西时 交流的对方并不仅仅获得一个方向的信息 也获得了他人 对事物意义的理解以及态度 很快地他们开始建立这个意义的系统 但这一系统中意义 要求他们与人进行互动而获得
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others.	这些意义 是通过他们与人分享自己的经验而得到的
Well, this is a little 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism.	有个15个月大的小女孩 她有自闭症
And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me.	我靠她非常地近 大概离她的脸只有2英寸,她却完全不理睬我
Imagine if I did that to you, and I came two inches from your face.	想象一下我对你这么做, 离你的脸2英寸那么近
You'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?	你很有可能会有种反应,对吧?
You would recoil. You would call the police.	你可能会往后退,或者叫警察.
You would do something, because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get a reaction.	你一定会做点什么. 因为你进去了别人的空间 而不引起反应是不可能的.
We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly.	对我们而言，这是自然而然，毫不费劲的.
This is our body wisdom. It's not something that is mediated by our language. Our body just knows that, and we've known that for a long time.	这是我们身体的智慧. 并不是语言教会我们的. 我们的身体就是知道如何反应, 这是我们早就知道的事实.
And this is not something that happens to humans only.	不光是人类会有如此反应.
It happens to some of our phylatic cousins, because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey, and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you, and that is considered to be a signal or threat, well, you are not going to be alive for long.	对于我们进化上的远亲,也是如此 如果你是一只猴子 你正在看着另一只猴子 另一只猴子比你的等级更高 如果这被看成是一种信号或威胁, 你是不会活很久的
So something that in other species are survival mechanisms, without them they wouldn't basically live, we bring into the context of human beings, and this is what we need to simply act, act socially.	这对其他动物来说是不可缺少的生存技能 离开这些技能他们活不下去 而对于人类社会来说 我们就需要这样反应，互动性的反应
Now, she is oblivious to me, and I am so close to her, and you think, maybe she can see you, maybe she can hear you.	她那样地对我不理不睬，可我离她那么近 可能你觉得，她看得见你 也许她听得到你
Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;M.	可是，几分钟以后， 她会走到屋子里的某个角落 发现地上的小糖果，MM糖。
So I could not attract her attention, but something, a thing, did.	我根本吸引不了她的注意力 但有的东西，某个小物件，却可以！
Now, most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people.	如今，大多数人都会将物的世界与人的世界 分得一清二楚
Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear, and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like.	但是对这个自闭症女孩而言， 这个分割线却不是很清晰 人的世界并不吸引她 但却能吸引我们
Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences.	我们能从分享经验当中 学到很多东西
Now, what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further.	但这个自闭症女孩所做的事情 使得她的学习方式越来越偏离正常的轨道， 因为她不断地封闭自己
So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic, the brain determines who we are going to be.	有时候我们会觉得大脑是决定性的 它决定我们将要成为什么样的人
But in fact the brain also becomes who we are, and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind and this is what's happening with her brain.	但实际上大脑也会被我们的行为影响 当她越来越孤僻 互动越来越少的时候 她的思想和大脑也受到行为的影响
Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders, and it's a brain disorder.	在所有成长障碍中， 自闭症与基因的关系最大， 自闭症是脑部神经错乱引起的
It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born.	这种紊乱在孩子早在出生之前 就开始形成了
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.	我们现在知道自闭症有很多不同的种类
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled, but there are those that are gifted.	有很多自闭症患者有严重的智力障碍 但也有很多天赋异禀
There are those individuals who don't talk at all.	有的患者完全不讲话
There are those individuals who talk too much.	又有的会一直说个不停
There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school, you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them, to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly, relentlessly, but often in an awkward fashion, without that immediate resonance.	有的患者如果你到他们学校里去观察他们 他们会一直围着学校的围墙跑个不停 如果你不阻止他们（他们会一直跑） 有的人会一直不停地跑到你面前来 不断地想引起你的注意 但他们的方式常有点奇怪 从而无法引起你的共鸣
Well, this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time.	自闭症如今要更普遍得多，
When I started in this field, we thought that there were four individuals with autism per 10,000, a very rare condition.	我刚开始进入这个领域时， 我们以为一万个人里差不多有四个自闭症患者 因而，自闭症显得比较罕见
Well, now we know it's more like one in 100.	但现在我们知道，100个人里大概就有一个自闭症患者
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us.	我们的身边有着数百万的患有自闭症的人
The societal cost of this condition is huge.	社会为此而消耗的成本极大
In the U.S. alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars, and you know what? Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled, individuals who need wrap-around services, services that are very, very intensive, and those services can cost in excess of 60 to 80,000 dollars a year.	仅美国这一花费大概就达到了350亿到800亿美元， 大家知道么，这些经费的很大一部分 都被用在青少年， 尤其是那些患有严重障碍的成年人 以及那些需要全方位密集照顾的患者身上 需要极为高强度的照顾 这样的服务大概每年需要花费6万到8万美元
Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment, because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you.	有的人没有获得早期的治疗 而我们知道，自闭症随着学习方式的不断偏离 而逐渐恶化 就像我刚才提过的那样
Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point, and intervene and treat, I can tell you, and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years, this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition.	我们能否及早发现自闭症的症状 进行干预与治疗呢? 我可以跟大家说,这个想法 在过去十年大大的改变了我的生活 我们完全可以 减轻自闭症的症状
Also, we have a window of opportunity, because the brain is malleable for just so long, and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life.	但是,我们的机会并不多 因为大脑的可塑性只有那么一阵 而这为数不多的机会时间 是人生命的前三年
It's not that that window closes. It doesn't.	这并不是说之后就没有机会了，不是这样的
But it diminishes considerably.	但机会确实是越来越小
And yet, the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years, and in disadvantaged populations, the populations that don't have access to clinical services, rural populations, minorities, the age of diagnosis is later still, which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe.	在美国，被诊断出自闭症的年龄 仍然在五岁左右 但在一些贫困地区 或一些医疗条件不好的地区 农村人口以及少数族裔自闭症患者 被确诊的年龄还要滞后 这就好像我们要和他们说 那些社区的自闭症患情况 会越来越严重
So I feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative.	所以我觉得我们在生物伦理上负有责任。
The science is there, but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community, and we just can't afford that missed opportunity, because children with autism become adults with autism, and we feel that those things that we can do for these children, for those families, early on, will have lifetime consequences, for the child, for the family, and for the community at large.	技术已经有了 但技术如果无法对社区产生影响 那么技术也就不存在，我们若不抓住机会， 后果将不是我们所能负担的。 因为自闭症孩子会变成患有自闭症的成人， 我们能为孩子们、为他们的家庭做的事情 如果早一点做到， 将会产生影响终身的作用， 不管是对孩子，还是对其家庭以及社区而言都是如此
So this is our view of autism.	这就是我们对于自闭症的看法
There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism. In fact, we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism, and genetic anomalies, much more than just genes.	和自闭症有关的基因多达一百个 实际上，我们相信，很有可能 将会有300到600个基因是与自闭症有关的 不仅仅是基因，而是基因异常
And we actually have a bit of a question here, because if there are so many different causes of autism, how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome?	这时候我们遇到一个问题 既然有那么多引起自闭症的原因 那我们可不可以根据这些异常基因 来追查具体的症状呢？
Because people like myself, when we walk into a playroom, we recognize a child as having autism.	 像我这样的人 当我们进入一个游戏室时， 我们就能判断一个孩子是否有自闭症
So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?	那要怎样从很多的形成原因中 追查一系列相似的症状呢？
And the answer is, what lies in between, which is development.	答案就在成因与症状之间， 即孩子的成长
And in fact, we are very interested in those first two years of life, because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism.	事实上，我们对孩子两岁前的生活非常感兴趣 因为那些不利因素 未必一定会演变成自闭症
Autism creates itself.	自闭症会自行形成
Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life, we might attenuate for some, and God knows, maybe even prevent for others.	我们能否在那些年里进行干预？ 我们也许能减轻一些症状，谁知道呢！ 也许还能阻止一些人得上自闭症
So how do we do that?	那我们该怎么做呢？
How do we enter that feeling of resonance, how do we enter another person's being?	我们怎么样能引起共鸣？ 怎么样进入到别人的存在当中？
I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-older, that the thing that came to mind was, "How do you come into her world?	我记得当我和那个15个月大的孩子在一起互动时， 我脑子里只有一件事 怎么样才能进入到她的世界呢？
Is she thinking about me?	她是在想着我么？
Is she thinking about others?"	还是她正在想着别人？
Well, it's hard to do that, so we had to create the technologies. We had to basically step inside a body.	这很难做到，我们必须倚靠技术 我们必须到她身体内部的世界中去
We had to see the world through her eyes.	我们要从她的眼睛看世界。
And so in the past many years we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking.	所以过去的很多年我们都在做一项技术 以眼球追踪为基础，
We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with.	我们可以看到在每个不同的时刻， 孩子们都是被什么吸引了
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare.	这是我的同事，Warren Jones, 我们一起研究创造这些方法， 整整研究了12年， 你看这是一个五个月大的婴儿 这个五月大的男孩将要去观看别的事物， 就是他世界里存在的事物， 他的妈妈，照顾他的人，还有一些 他日间被照顾时的各种经历
What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory, but in order for us to do that, we had to create these very sophisticated measures, measures of how people, how little babies, how newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment, what is important, and what is not.	我们所要做的，就是拥抱他的世界， 并把那世界带到实验室来， 但为了达到这个目的， 我们要创建很精密的测量方法， 测量人们以及婴儿 如何与世界互动的方法 每个时刻都要测量 从而知道什么是重要的，什么是不重要的
Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention.	我们创建了这些测量方法， 现在大家所看到的这个东西叫 注意力漏斗
You're watching a video.	你们看到的这个视频
Those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds, and we freeze one frame, and this is what the typical children are doing.	每幅影像的间距大约是一秒 这是35个正常孩子所看到的世界 他们都是两岁大的孩子 当我们停在其中一幅影像上时 这是正常的孩子在做的事情
In this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism.	而绿色的地方，是自闭症的孩子在做的事情
So on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this, the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl.	视频停留在那个画面上时， 正常孩子在看这些， 再看那个小男孩情绪的反应 那个小男孩和那个小女孩正在闹矛盾
What are the children with autism doing?	而自闭症的孩子在做什么呢？
They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting.	他们会注意那个不断转动的门， 看着门开了又关，关了又开
Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment.	我可以告诉大家， 这里就有了差异， 这不仅仅发生在我们5分钟的实验里
It happens moment by moment in their real lives, and their minds are being formed, and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers.	而在他们生活里的每一分钟都发生着， 他们的心智就此而形成， 它们的脑子在其他的方面不断发展， 而这些方面与他们同龄的伙伴有所不同
Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts.	这里有一个结构图， 这是从我们的儿科医生朋友那里拿过来的， 这是一幅关于生长曲线概念的图，
You know, when you take a child to the pediatrician, and so you have physical height, and weight.	你知道，你带一个孩子去看儿科医生时， 你会得到他的身高，体重
Well we decided that we're going to create growth charts of social engagement, and we sought children from the time that they are born, and what you see here on the x-axis is two, three, four, five, six months and nine, until about the age of 24 months, and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people's eyes, and this is their growth chart.	所以我们决定我们要作出一个 社交发展的成长图 我们找了很多孩子参与实验，从他们出生开始 大家可以看到X轴上写着2，3，4， 5，6，到9，一直到大概24个月 这些是他们盯着人的眼睛 看的时间百分比， 这就是他们的成长表
They start over here, they love people's eyes, and it remains quite stable.	他们爱看人的眼睛，从这里开始， 基本上很平稳，
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.	在最初的几个月里它还上升了一些.
Now, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic.	我们再来看看 这些有自闭症的孩子的曲线.
It's something very different.	非常的不同
It starts way up here, but then it's a free fall.	刚开始很高，然后就一直下降。
It's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people, but it has no traction.	这表明，他们本来具有追寻人眼神的能力 但后来却不再被吸引了
It's almost as if that stimulus, you, you're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives.	这就是说，你，作为一个外界的刺激 你对他们产生不了影响了 在他们探索日常生活的过程中你不无关紧要
Now, we thought that those data were so powerful in a way, that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life, because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-older, you'd be surprised by how social those babies are.	这些数据如此重要， 以致于我们非常想知道在出生后的六个月里， 到底发生了什么， 因为当你开始与一个两三个月大的孩子互动时， 你会对这些孩子的社会性感到惊讶
And what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily.	我们在那六个月看到了一个情况， 这两组孩子很容易被区分开来
And using these kinds of measures, and many others, what we found out is that our science could, in fact, identify this condition early on.	通过这些方法或者其它的方法， 我们发现，实际上我们的科学， 是可以及早地诊断出自闭症的
We didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life.	我们不需要等到第二年 自闭症的症状开始出现时才确诊
If we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved, and developmentally very early emerging, things that are online from the first weeks of life, we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months, and that's what we are doing now.	如果我们测量的东西是进化而来， 并保存下来的，且出现的时间非常早的话， 尤其是出生后几周就出现的症状， 我们就可以将对其诊断提前到， 提早到出生后的两个月内， 这就使我们如今在研究的内容，
Now, we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children, but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community.	现在，我们可以创造出最好的科学技术， 还有最好的方法来争端那些患自闭症的孩子 但如果我们不能改变他们的现实情况， 这一切都徒劳无功.
Now we want those devices, of course, to be deployed by those who are in the trenches, our colleagues, the primary care physicians, who see every child, and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice, because they have to see so many children.	当然了，我们现在需要各种设备 能被送到第一线的工作人员那里 我们的同事，那些坐诊的医生， 他们能见到每个孩子， 我们需要把这些技术， 转变成对他们的工作有实际用处和价值的东西， 因为他们要帮助那么多孩子，
And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child, but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment.	我们希望我们的成果能广泛推广， 这样我们就不会漏掉任何一个孩子， 但如果没有完善的基础设施， 和干预治疗的方法 那这也是违反这会责任与道德，
We need to be able to work with the families, to support the families, to manage those first years with them. We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment, because those treatments are going to change these children's and those families' lives.	我们需要能够与家庭合作， 去支持那些家庭，在最开始的几年里与他们一起， 我们需要从诊断他们是否患病， 发展到普遍有效的治疗方法， 因为这些治疗将会改变 孩子与他们家人的生活
Now, when we think about what we [can] do in those first years, I can tell you, having been in this field for so long, one feels really rejuvenated.	现在，我们要想想我们能做些什么， 我可以告诉大家， 在这个领域这么多年， 最开始的几年， 人会觉得自己很年轻充满干劲，
There is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities, preventing, in fact, those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field.	会感觉我自己所钻研的科学 真的能给现实带来影响， 可以让其他人不再重蹈我的覆辙 不走我走过的老路，
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition.	我那时以为自闭症是个无法治愈的疾病
No longer.	但如今再也不这么想了。
We can do a great deal of things.	 我们可以做很多事情。
And the idea is not to cure autism.	我们的想法并不是说要完全治愈自闭症。
That's not the idea.	那不是我们要的。
What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times, the profound intellectual disabilities, the lack of language, the profound, profound isolation.	我们要的，是要确认， 那些患了自闭症的人 能从那些可怕的结果中释放出来，得到自由 不再是严重的智障，或者是语言能力的缺失， 也不再极度的封闭
We feel that individuals with autism, in fact, have a very special perspective on the world, and we need diversity, and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength: predictable situations, situations that can be defined.	我们觉得实际上自闭症患者， 看待世界的视角非常的特别， 我们需要这样的多样性， 他们能做得特别好， 在一些他们擅长的领域， 在可预测的情况下，可掌控的情况下。
Because after all, they learn about the world almost like about it, rather than learning how to function in it.	毕竟他们专注于世界本来的面貌， 而不是学习怎样在世界上生存，
But this is a strength, if you're working, for example, in technology.	这就是一个长项。 例如，当你的工作在技术层面时 这就是一个长项。
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities.	还有一些人，具有极高的天分 艺术上的天分
We want them to be free of that.	我们希望他们也能自由施展，
We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise.	我们希望下一代患有自闭症的人 不仅能发挥他们的长处， 更能实现他们美好的梦想。
Well thank you for listening to me.	谢谢
So here's the good news about families.	我这有一条关于家庭的好消息。
The last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family.	在过去的50年里，家庭的意义 有了革命性的改变
We have blended families, adopted families, we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house.	出现了离异后重新组合的家庭，收养关系组成的家庭， 出现了独立出来居住的小家庭， 也出现了住在同一座房子里的离异家庭。
But through it all, the family has grown stronger.	但是经过这些年，家庭关系变得更加稳固了。
Eight in 10 say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.	80%的人认为他们现在所在的家庭 和他们成长所处的家庭一样稳固，或更加稳固。

Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress, draw our family closer, and generally prepare our children to enter the world?	有没有什么具体的方法可以让我们减轻压力， 让我们的家庭更亲密， 使我们的孩子更好的准备进入这个世界？
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question, traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars, experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.	过去几年我一直在寻找这个问题的答案， 去了许多地方，探访了不同家庭，跟学者们交谈， 跟不同领域的专家，包括进行和平谈判的精英， 沃伦·巴菲特的银行家，和绿色贝雷帽 （美国陆军特种部队）
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right and what can I learn from them to make my family happier?	我在试着找出，幸福的家庭做对了什么， 我又能从他们那里学到什么可以让我的家庭更幸福？
I want to tell you about one family that I met, and why I think they offer clues.	我想告诉你们我认识的一个家庭的故事， 和我为什么觉得他们提供了线索。
At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho, where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.	星期天晚上7点，在爱达荷州的隐泉区， 斯塔尔家的6个成员坐在一起 参加他们每周的重点活动：家庭会议。

Instead of turning to friends or relatives, they looked to David's workplace.	他们没有向朋友或亲戚诉苦， 而是从大卫的工作中寻找解决方法。
They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan to startups in Silicon Valley.	他们采用了一种称为敏捷开发的管理方式 这种管理方式当时刚刚从日本的制造业 流传到硅谷的初创公司。

When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters, it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.	当我和妻子将这种家庭会议和其他一些技术 引入到我们当时只有五岁的双胞胎女儿的生活中时， 这是我们在女儿出生后做过的最大的改变。
And these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes.	这些会议确实管用 并且会议时间不超过20分钟。
So what is Agile, and why can it help with something that seems so different, like families?	什么是敏捷开发，为什么它可以帮助 看起来很不一样的系统，像是家庭？
In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England.	在1983年，杰夫·萨瑟兰是一名技术专家， 在新英格兰地区的一家金融公司，
He was very frustrated with how software got designed.	他对当时的软件设计方法感到沮丧。
Companies followed the waterfall method, right, in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below, and no one had ever consulted the programmers.	公司遵循这个瀑布开发模型，对吧， 这里高层管理人员宣布命令，然后慢慢渗透 到下面的程序员那里。 但是从没有人咨询过这些程序员。
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.	83％的项目都失败了。
They were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done.	当这些项目终于被完成时， 往往延期很久，或预算严重超支。
Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time.	萨瑟兰想要创造一个系统 让灵感不仅可以自上而下的传播，而且可以自下而上的聚集， 并且能够及时的调整。
He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review before stumbling upon an article in 1986 called "The New New Product Development Game."	他翻阅了30年的《哈佛商业评论》杂志 发现了在1986年发表的一篇文章 叫做新新产品开发游戏。
It said that the pace of business was quickening -- and by the way, this was in 1986 -- and the most successful companies were flexible.	里面说商业的脚步正在加快－ 注意，这是1986－ 最成功的公司都很灵活。
It highlighted Toyota and Canon and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.	里面点出了丰田和佳能 说他们紧密的团队就像英式橄榄球争球.
As Sutherland told me, we got to that article, and said, "That's it."	根据萨瑟兰告诉我的，我们找到了这篇文章， 说，就是这个了，
In Sutherland's system, companies don't use large, massive projects that take two years.	在萨瑟兰的系统中，公司不做 很大的，要拖两年之久的项目。
They do things in small chunks.	他们把事情分成小部分。
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.	任何事情都在两个星期内完成。
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network," you say, "You go off and come up with one element, then bring it back.	他们不会说，你们躲到一个仓库里好好研究 等做出来个电话或者社交网络再回来， 你会说，你们先做出来一个元件， 然后把它带回来。
Let's talk about it.	我们讨论一下，看看是否需要调整。
Let's adapt."	
You succeed or fail quickly.	你很快就知道是否行得通。
Today, agile is used in a hundred countries, and it's sweeping into management suites.	现在，敏捷开发在上百个国家得到运用， 而且快速的融入了管理阶层。
Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families.	必然的，人们开始将其中一些技术 引入到自己的家庭中。
You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.	你能找到一些相关的博客文章，里面总结了一些运用守则。
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving, where you had one group of people working on the food, one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.	就连萨瑟兰都告诉我他们有过 一个敏捷式的感恩节， 一组人准备食物， 一组人在布置桌子，还有人在门口迎接来客。
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.	萨瑟兰说这是他们有过的最好的感恩节。
So let's take one problem that families face, crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.	现在我们从家庭面临的问题中挑出一个， 匆忙的早晨，讨论下敏捷管理如何帮助改进。
A key plank is accountability, so teams use information radiators, these large boards in which everybody is accountable.	要点是明确责任， 在团队中使用信息辐射体， 就是那些大白板来明确每个人的责任。
So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home, created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores.	斯塔尔家也采用了这种方法， 他们制作了一个早晨工作的清单 里面包含了每个孩子需要完成的家务。
So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs, poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair, and she sat there, kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs, checked the list, made themselves breakfast, checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher, rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had, checked the list once more, gathered their belongings, and made their way to the bus.	我去拜访的那天早晨，埃莉诺从楼上下来， 给她自己倒了一杯咖啡，坐在了摇椅上， 她就坐在那里， 和蔼的和她每一个孩子说话 看着他们一个接一个的下楼， 检查他们的清单，给他们自己做早餐， 再检查他们的清单，把盘子放在洗碗机内， 然后又检查清单，喂宠物或者其他他们需要负责的家务， 最后一次检查他们的清单，整理好他们的东西， 然后出门去坐校车了。
It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.	这是我所看过的最惊人的家庭运作方式。
And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house, our kids needed way too much monitoring, Eleanor looked at me.	当我极力表示这绝对不会在我家实现的， 我们的孩子需要太多监督了， 埃莉诺看着我。
"That's what I thought," she said.	我原来也这么想，她说。
"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'	我告诉大卫，不要把你的工作带到我的厨房。
But I was wrong."	 但是我错了。
So I turned to David: "So why does it work?"	所以我问大卫，这个为什么会管用？
He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."	他说，你不能低估这个动作的威力。
And he made a checkmark.	他画了一个对号。
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.	他说，在工作场合，成人都很爱它。
With kids, it's heaven."	对于孩子们，这跟天堂一样。
The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house, it cut parental screaming in half.	我们把这个清晨清单带入我们家的那个星期， 父母吼叫的次数减半了。
But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.	但是真正的改变直到我们开始了家庭会议才出现。
So following the agile model, we ask three questions: What worked well in our family this week, what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?	我们遵循了敏捷方式，问自己三个问题： 这个星期家里什么运作良好， 什么不好，还有我们下个星期希望做哪些改变？
Everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on.	每个人都会给出建议 然后我们挑选两个来关注。
And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.	突然之间，最了不起的话开始从我们女儿们的嘴里说出来。
What worked well this week?	这个星期什么运行的好？
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.	我们不再怕骑车了，我们会整理自己的床。
What didn't work well?	什么做的不好？
Our math sheets, or greeting visitors at the door.	我们的数学作业， 以及在门口迎接客人。
Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.	跟很多父母一样，（我们觉得）我们的孩子就像百慕大三角。
Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out, I mean at least not that are revealing.	跟他们说什么道理和要求都没有效果， 我的意思是，最起码没表现出来。
This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.	（家庭会议）突然让我们能够了解他们最深层的想法了。
But the most surprising part was when we turned to, what are we going to work on in the week ahead?	但是最令人吃惊的是当我们讨论 下一周我们需要做哪些工作的时候。
You know, the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves, and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.	你知道，敏捷方式的核心理论是 团队实质上在管理他们自己， 这个理念在软件上管用，在孩子们身上也有作用。
Our kids love this process.	我们的孩子很爱这个过程。
So they would come up with all these ideas.	他们会想出各种各样的主意。
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week, get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.	像这个星期在门口迎接五个客人， 就可以另外得到10分钟的睡前读书时间。
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.	踢别人，就一个月不能吃甜点。
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.	我们发现了，顺便说一下， 我们的女儿们跟小斯大林一样。
We constantly have to kind of dial them back.	我们需要不断的提醒他们不要太严厉。
Now look, naturally there's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week, but the truth is it didn't really bother us.	现在来看，她们在家庭会议上的计划 不会百分百的在下个星期得到落实， 但是我们实际上并不在意。
It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.	感觉上就像我们在建设地下电缆 在许多年后才会照亮他们的世界。
Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now -- We're still holding these meetings.	三年之后－我们的女孩们现在快八岁了－ 我们仍然在进行这些会议。
My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.	我妻子认为这个她作为妈妈最宝贵的时刻之一。
So what did we learn?	所以我们从中学到了什么？
The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001 when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.	Agile这个词在2001年被纳入了词典 那一年杰夫·萨瑟兰和一些设计师 在犹他州碰面，并写下了12点《敏捷宣言》。
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.	我认为是时候做一个《敏捷家庭宣言》了。
I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.	我从斯塔尔家和我拜访过的许多其他家庭中得到了一些主意。
I'm proposing three planks.	我提出三个重点。
Plank number one: Adapt all the time.	重点一：随时调整适应。
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?	当我成为一名父亲的时候，我就想，这样吧
We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.	我们就定下几条规定，然后就按照规定做。
That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.	这里的假设是我们作为父母可以预料到所有可能出现的问题。
We can't.	我们不能。
What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.	敏捷系统很棒的一点 是你在一个变化的系统中建立的 这使你可以随时对发生的状况做出反应。
It's like they say in the Internet world: if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago, you're doing the wrong thing.	互联网业界流传着一句话： 如果你今天做着和六个月前一样的事情， 你一定做错了。
Parents can learn a lot from that.	父母可以从中学到很多。
But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.	对我来说，随时调整适应 有着更深层的含义。
We have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus or other family experts.	我们父母必须从以前的教条中解放出来， 家庭管理并不是只能听从 心理医生，自助专家，或者家庭专家 提供的建议。
The truth is, their ideas are stale, whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively.	事实上，他们的建议过时了， 而世界上所有其他领域都有新的技术 让小组和团队更加高效率的工作。
Let's just take a few examples.	就让我们来看几个例子。
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.	来看一下最大的问题：家庭晚餐。
Everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids.	所有人都知道家庭晚餐 和孩子们一起对他们有好处。
But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.	但是对于我们大多数人来说，无法在生活中实现。
I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said, "No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.	我在新奥尔良认识的一位明星厨师说过， 没问题，我把家庭晚餐时间改了就好了。
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?	我不在家，不能弄家庭晚餐？
We'll have family breakfast.	那我们就来家庭早餐。
We'll meet for a bedtime snack.	在睡前点心时间见面也可以。
We'll make Sunday meals more important."	我们把周日的聚餐弄得更重要一些。
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.	事实就是，最近的研究同意他的观点。
It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal.	研究发现在任何家庭聚餐中只有 十分钟的有效时间。
The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."	剩下的时间说的都是把你的臂肘放下去和把番茄酱递给我。
You can take that 10 minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit.	你可以把这十分钟挪到 一天里的任何时段，效果是一样的。
So time-shift family dinner.	所有挪开家庭晚餐的时间。
That's adaptability.	这就是适应性。
An environmental psychologist told me, "If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface, you'll be more rigid.	一位环境心理学家告诉过我， 如果你坐在硬椅子或硬平台上， 你会比较死板。
If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."	如果你坐在软垫的椅子上，你会比较开放。
She told me, "When you're discipling your children, sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.	她还说，当你在惩罚你的孩子时， 坐在一个直立的带软垫的椅子上。
The conversation will go better."	谈话会比较顺利。
My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because I was sitting above in the power position.	我跟我妻子真的改变了进行严肃谈话时坐的位置， 因为我以前坐得比较高，显得强势。
So move where you sit.	所以改变你的座位。
That's adaptability.	这就是适应性。
The point is there are all these new ideas out there.	我要说的就是到处都有这种新的想法。
We've got to hook them up with parents.	父母们需要将这些结合起来。
So plank number one: Adapt all the time.	这就是重点一：随时调整适应。
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.	要灵活，要开放，让最好的主意胜出。
Plank number two: Empower your children.	重点二：给你的孩子权利。
Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.	我们作为父母的潜意识是命令我们的孩子做事情。
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.	这比较简单，坦率地说，我们一般都是对的。
There's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family.	这是家庭比其它系统更加倾向于 瀑布管理模型的原因之一。
But the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.	但是我们学到的最重要的一堂课就是 尽最大可能逆转这种管理模式。
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.	让孩子们在成长中掌控自己。
Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting, and we had voted to work on overreacting.	就在昨天，我们开家庭会议， 我们在讨论如何改善反应过度的行为。
So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment.	我们说，好的，我们规定一个奖励和一个惩罚，好吗？
Okay?"	
So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.	我们一个女儿提出，每人每星期有5分钟的反应过度时间。
So we kind of liked that.	我们都觉得这个还不错。
But then her sister started working the system.	但是她妹妹开始改进这个系统。
She said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"	她说。我会得到一个5分钟的反应过度时间 还是十个三十秒钟的反应过度时间？
I loved that.	我很爱这点。
Spend the time however you want.	你可以自由分配这个时间。
Now give us a punishment.	现在给我们一个惩罚。
Okay.	好的
If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.	如果我们有十五分钟的反应过度时间，这是极限。
Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.	超出范围的每一分钟，我们必须做一个俯卧撑。
So you see, this is working.	所以你可以看到，系统在运转。
Now look, this system isn't lax.	现在可以看到，这个系统是玩真的。
There's plenty of parental authority going on.	我们保留了很多父母的权威。
But we're giving them practice becoming independent, which of course is our ultimate goal.	但是我们让孩子们练习独立， 这也是我们的最终目的。
Just as I was leaving to come here tonight, one of my daughters started screaming.	就当我今晚要离开家来这的时候， 我们的一个女儿开始尖叫。
The other one said, "Overreaction!	另一个就开始说，反应过度！
Overreaction!"	反应过度！
and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.	而且开始了数数，十秒钟之内尖叫就停止了。
To me that is a certified agile miracle.	对我来说，这是一个见证敏捷奇迹的时刻。
And by the way, research backs this up too.	顺便说一下，也有研究支持这一点。
Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules, evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives.	孩子们计划他们自己的目标，设定每周计划， 评估他们自己的工作会增强他们的额叶皮层 也会更好的控制他们的生活。
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms, and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.	我要说的点是，我们必须要让孩子们在他们自己努力下成功， 当然还有，有时候，在他们自己的努力下失败。
I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker, and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance.	我曾和一位沃伦·巴菲特的银行家谈话， 他指责我不允许我的孩子 在他们的限度内犯错误。
And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"	我说，如果他们惹麻烦怎么办？
He said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary or a $6 million inheritance."	他说，他们现在用6块钱零花钱惹麻烦 要比到年薪六万年薪或者继承了六百万美元遗产的时候 惹麻烦好得多。
So the bottom line is, empower your children.	所以底线就是，给你的孩子权利。
Plank number three: Tell your story.	重点三：讲述你的故事。
Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.	适应性很好，但是我们还需要基石。
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great," told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common: they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.	吉姆·柯林斯, 从优秀到卓越的作者， 告诉过我任何形势的人类组织 都有两个共同点： 他们维持核心价值，并激励发展。
So agile is great for stimulating progress, but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.	敏捷系统能很好的刺激发展， 但是我一直不断的听到，你需要维持核心价值。
So how do you do that?	所以你改怎么做呢？
Collins coached us on doing something that businesses do, which is define your mission and identify your core values.	柯林斯教我们做 企业做的事，就是定义你的使命 和确定你的核心价值。
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.	他带领我们创立一个家庭使命.
We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.	我们做了一个家庭版的企业活动。
We had a pajama party.	我们办了一个睡衣派对。
I made popcorn.	我做了爆米花。
Actually, I burned one, so I made two.	实际上，我烧焦了一个，所以我做了两个。
My wife bought a flip chart.	我妻子买了一个挂图。
And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?	然后我们进行了很棒的谈话，比如，什么对我们来说重要？
What values do we most uphold?	我们最坚持什么价值？
And we ended up with 10 statements.	我们最后得出了十条定论。
We are travelers, not tourists.	我们是旅客，不是游客。
We don't like dilemmas.	我们不喜欢困境。
We like solutions.	我们喜欢解决。
Again, research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing on what they do right, worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.	再说一次，研究表示父母需要更少的 担心孩子们办了什么错事 更多的关注他们做的对的地方， 少担心不好的时候，建立更多的好时光。
This family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right.	这个家庭使命可以很好的坚定 你做的哪些是对的。
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.	几个星期后，我们接到学校打来的电话。
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.	我们的一个女儿与人发生了争执。
And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?	我们突然开始担心，如果我们有个坏女孩该怎么办？
And we didn't really know what to do, so we called her into my office.	我们但是并不知道要怎么办， 所以我们把她叫到了我的办公室。
The family mission statement was on the wall, and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"	家庭使命挂在墙上， 我的妻子说，那上面有哪个内容合适吗？
And she kind of looked down the list, and she said, "Bring people together?"	她看了一下列表，说， 团结大家？
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.	我们一下子就有了开始的话题。
Another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from.	讲述你的故事的另一个很好的方式 是告诉你的孩子他们从哪里来。
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple "what do you know" test.	艾默理大学的研究员给了孩子们一个简单的 你知道什么测试。
Do you know where your grandparents were born?	你知道你的祖父祖母在哪里出生吗？
Do you know where your parents went to high school?	你知道你父母在哪里上的高中吗？
Do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?	你知道你家里有没有任何人 有过困难时期，生病了又战胜了病魔？
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.	那些在知道榜上得到最高分的孩子们 有最强的自信和更能感觉到他们有能控制自己的生活的能力。
The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness.	这个知道测试是最可以测试 心理健康和幸福的。
As the author of the study told me, children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence.	这个研究的作者告诉我， 这些感觉到他们是更大的故事里的一部分的孩子们 有更强的自信。
So my final plank is, tell your story.	所以我最后一个重点是，讲述你的故事。
Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones.	花一些时间多讲几次你的家庭愉快的故事 和怎样克服困难时期的故事。
If you give children this happy narrative, you give them the tools to make themselves happier.	如果你给你的孩子开心的讲述， 你就给了他们让自己更开心的工具。
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina" and its famous opening sentence, "All happy families are alike.	我十几岁的时候第一次读安妮·卡列尼娜 和它非常有名的开篇第一句， 幸福的家庭都是相似的。
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."	不幸的家庭各有各的不幸。
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.	当我第一次读它的时候，我想，这是句疯话。
Of course all happy families aren't alike."	幸福的家庭当然不都是一样的。
But as I began working on this project, I began changing my mind.	但当我开始做这个项目时， 我开始改变我的想法了。
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time, to identify the building blocks that successful families have.	近期的学术研究让我们第一次， 能够辨别出成功家庭 普遍具备的要素。
I've mentioned just three here today: Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.	我今天只谈到了三点： 随时调整适应，给你的孩子权利，讲述你的故事。
Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?	这么多年后，可不可能说托尔斯泰是对的？
The answer, I believe, is yes.	答案，我相信，是可以。
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old, his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick, which he had hidden in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.	当列夫·托尔斯泰五岁大的时候， 他的哥哥尼古拉来到他面前 说他把万能幸福的秘密刻在了 一个小绿棒上面，藏在了他们家族 位于俄罗斯的庄园的山沟里。
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.	如果那个木棒被找到，全人类都会得到幸福。
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.	托尔斯泰便一直在寻找这个木棒，但始终没有找到。
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.	甚至，他要求被葬在那个他认为是埋藏地的山沟里。
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.	他至今仍在那里，被一层又一层的绿草覆盖着。
That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned: Happiness is not something we find, it's something we make.	这个故事很完美的对我讲述了 我学到的最后一课： 幸福不是我们找到的， 而是我们创造的。
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion.	基本上所有观察运行的好的企业的人 都会得到差不多一样的结论。
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.	伟大并不取决于环境。
It's a matter of choice.	而取决于选择。
You don't need some grand plan.	你不需要什么大型的计划。
You don't need a waterfall.	你不需要瀑布。
You just need to take small steps, accumulate small wins, keep reaching for that green stick.	你只需要迈出小步， 积累小胜利， 坚持接近那个绿木棒。
In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.	最后，这可能是最伟大的一堂课。
What's the secret to a happy family?	幸福家庭的秘密是什么？
Try.	是尝试。
Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years.	13万亿的财富 在过去的两年间里蒸发殆尽。
We've questioned the future of capitalism.	我们质疑过资本主义的未来。
We've questioned the financial industry.	我们也对金融业产生过怀疑。
We've looked at our government oversight.	我们检视我们的政府的疏忽。
We've questioned where we're going.	我们对未来的方向感到迷茫。
And yet, at the same time, this very well may be a seminal moment in American history, an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America.	然而，与此同时，危机的到来不仅仅意味着 美国正处在历史上的关键时刻， 对消费者而言，更是一种机遇。 他们能够真正的掌握主动权， 并且带领我们进入一个新的发展轨道。
I'm calling this The Great Unwind.	我们把它称之为一场大松绑。
And the idea is a simple, simple idea, which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action.	其实这本身是一个非常简单的理念， 它描述了这样一个事实， 即消费者正从过去焦虑不安的状态向付诸行动逐渐发生转变。
Consumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America have actually started, just like banks and just like businesses, to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage, in daily life, to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward.	占美国国内生产总值72%的消费群体 事实上已经开始行动了， 正如银行和企业 所采取的一系列去杠杆化措施， 在日常生活中，消费者们 让自己从负债和风险中解脱出来， 继续前行。
So, to understand this -- and I'm going to stress this -- it's not about the consumer being in retreat.	因此，为了便于理解，我想要强调， 消费者们并没有退缩，
The consumer is empowered.	他们被赋予了权力。
In order to understand this, we're going to step back and look a little bit at what's happened over the course of the last year and a half.	为了更清楚的阐明我的观点，让我们往回走 看看过去的一年半时间里发生了什么。
So, if you've been gone, this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy.	如果你也同样经历了这一切的话， 我下面将要讲述的便是最简单的摘要。
Okay?	可以吗？
Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down.	失业率~上升，房产价格~下降，资本市场~猛跌
Commodity prices are like this.	商品价格这样变化。
If you're a mom trying to manage a budget, and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer, and it's somewhere between 50 and 70, do you plan vacations?	如果你是你个负责预算的母亲， 去年夏天的汽油价格是每桶150美元， 而现在则是介于50到70美元之间， 你还打算去度假吗？

Will the bailout work?	政府援助会起作用吗？
We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, healthcare, all these issues facing us.	我们面临的问题有国债，底特律， 货币估价，医疗保健等等。
You put them all together, you mix them up in a bouillabaisse, and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time-bomb.	你把他们放在一起，混合成一碗法式鱼肉汤。 另外，你还拥有消费者信心，而它基本就是一个滴答作响的定时炸弹。
In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis, because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives, actually contributed a large part to the problem.	其实我们应该回头看看是什么导致了这场危机； 因为，在日常生活中，所有消费者 实际上都极大程度上促成了这一问题的产生。
This is something I call the 50-20 paradox.	这就是我称之为 50/20悖论 的东西。
It took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent.	我们花费了50年 来达到年储蓄率接近10%的水平。

Right?	对吗？
So, what happened though, over the course of the last 20 years -- we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate.	那么，过去20年发生了什么 使得储蓄率从10%下降到负值？
Because we binged. We bought extra-large cars, supersized everything, we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome.	因为我们大肆享受：我们买超大的汽车， 一切超大型的东西；我们似乎得了坐立不安综合症并为之买单。
All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today.	所有这些加一起，大体上就是 导致消费者进入危机的原因， 我们如此仓促，手足无措。
The personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 percent to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years.	在过去大概15年的区间内， 个人负债与收入比率 大体上从65%增长到135%。
It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009.	它展示了从1919到2009年间杠杆的变化趋势。
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education, future children in our households.	你在最后面看到的是一整个现象， 那就是，我们实际上在举债， 我们在提前透支 未来教育及未来孩子们的花费。
So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout, what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills, first of all, 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.	如果你在政府救援背景下想想这个问题， 你将看到的是，如果一个人堆积美元钞票， 首先是360,000美元 -大致相当于一个5.4英寸人的高度
But if you stack it up, you just see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out.	但是，如果将钱堆积起来，你看到的仅仅是 数量惊人的美元被投入系统 以资助和援救我们。
So this is the first 315 billion.	这就是最初的3150亿美元。
But I read this fact the other day, that one trillion seconds equals 32 thousand years, so if you think about that, the context, the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here, and trillion there, we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.	前不久，我看到这样一个事实： 一万亿秒相当于32000年。 你想想这种情形： 我们在多么轻松地谈论金钱，这儿一万亿，那儿一万亿。 我们在堆积一个长期的杠杆。
However, consumers have moved.	但是，消费者开始行动了，
They are taking responsibility.	他们在承担责任。
What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate.	我们开到储蓄率在提高

We are working our way back up to that 10 percent.	我们正朝着恢复储蓄率到10%的方向前进。
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter, spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years, almost a 3.7 percent decline.	另外值得注意的是 第四季度的花费降到62年来的最低点， 几乎下降了3.7%。

And you've got to admit, over the course of the last year and a half, consumers have been doing some pretty weird things.	你不得不承认，在过去一年半中 消费者们做了些十分奇怪的事情，
It's been pretty staggering, what we've lived through.	我们所经历的真的很奇怪。

I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks.	我会给大家举些例子，比如牙医， 输精管切除书术，枪支和鲨鱼攻击。
Okay?	好吗？
Dentists report molars, you know, people grinding their teeth, coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress.	牙医报告说人们有磨牙。 磨牙的人去见牙医， 说他们感到有压力。
And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.	于是，越来越多的人不得不替换他们补牙所用的材料。
Guns, gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January.	负责检查背景的联邦调查局说 七月份以来，持枪数和枪支销售上涨了几乎25%。

Does anybody know why?	有人知道原因吗？
No one is at the beach.	没有人去海滩。
So there is a bright side to everything.	所以任何事物都有光明的一面。
But seriously, what we see happening, and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat, is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out.	不过严肃点说，正在发生的事情 以及我想强调消费者并未撤退的原因是： 这对消费者而言是一个巨大的机遇。 消费者将我们带入衰退， 但也能借此机遇引导我们走出衰退。
And what I mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption.	我的意思是，我们可以从不假思索的消费 变为深思熟虑的消费。
Right?	对吗？
If you think about the last three decades, the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s, to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade, but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate.	如果你想想过去30年， 消费者从90年代的信奉市场知识 变化到近十年的收集各种社会工具和搜索工具。 但是，有一样东西阻挡了他们的前进，那就是判断能力。
By restricting their demand, consumers can actually align their values with their spending, and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more, but be about better.	消费者因限制了自己的需求， 而能让他们的价值取向与消费相结合 并驱动资产主义和商业 到不只更多而是更好的境界。
We're going to explain that right now.	接下来我会解释这一点。

The first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life.	第一个文化价值转变是， 生活有种转向所谓液态生活的趋势。
This is the movement from Americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity, because the less excess that you have around you, the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.	美国人对成功的定义由资产的多寡 变为是否拥有液态生活。 因为，一个人周围的过度行为越少， 他的行动速度会越发灵敏。
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.	低调消费也因此流行，

The management principle is dollars and cents.	这个管理法则是金钱，

A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage, and his steam-driven computers that were never built.	像可怜的老 Charles Babbage 这样的人就行走在这灰色地带之中， 还有他那从未做好的蒸汽电脑。
Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind, except for Ada Lovelace, and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream.	没有人真正明白他脑海里的概念， 除了 Ada Lovelace， 而他直到入土前都一直在追寻那个梦想。
Vannevar Bush with his Memex -- this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips -- he had this vision.	Vannevar Bush 和他的 Memex ─ 一个让全人类的知识都在一指之遥的梦想 ─ 他一直坚信不疑。
And I think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook.	我想当时许多人 或许认为他是一个疯子。
And, yeah, we can look back in retrospect and say, yeah, ha-ha, you know -- it's all microfilm.	或许我们现在看来，会说： 耶，哈哈，你看，不就是微型胶片吗。
But that's -- that's not the point.	但那不是关键。
He understood the shape of the future.	 他明白未来是什么样子的。
So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction.	J.C.R. Likider 和他的人机互动概念也是如此。
Same thing: he understood the shape of the future, even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later.	同样地：他明白未来是什么样子的， 即使那仅仅是 多年之后人们才能做出的东西。
Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.	还有 Paul Barron，以及他对于包交换的先见之明。
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.	同一时代里几乎没有人理睬他。
Or even the people who actually pulled it off, the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston, who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network, and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's -- on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts, just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips singing "Midnight Train to Georgia," while -- -- in my dad's big easy chair, you know?	甚至是真正将其实现的人们， 波士顿的 Bolt Beranek and Newman 公司的人们， 他们将这最终连接全球的网络 的结构描绘出来， 描绘在纸巾背面和笔记本上， 在麻省莱克星顿的 Howard Johnson 旅店 的晚餐上争论不休 ─ 离我学习后翼弃兵以及 听 Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips 唱 Midnight Train to Georgia 的地方仅两英里之遥 ─ ─ 在我爸爸的摇椅上。
So, three types of vision, right?	有三种看事物的方式。
Vision based on what one cannot see: the vision of that unseen and unknowable.	一种着眼于人们看不到的东西： 着眼于不可见和不可知的事物。
The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained.	一种着眼于已经被证明或可确定的事物。
And this third kind of vision, of something which can be, which may be, based on knowledge, but is as yet unproven.	还有第三种 着眼于可能的事物， 根据现有知识来说 有可能，但尚未证明的事物。
Now, we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science, but I think it's also true in the arts, it's true in politics, it's even true in personal endeavors.	我们知道许多在科学领域中追寻那样的事物的人， 但我认为在艺术和政治中，也同样大有人在。 甚至在个人奋斗历程中。
What it comes down to, really, is four basic principles: learn from everyone, follow no one, watch for patterns, and work like hell.	归根结底，四条基本原则： 向所有人学习， 不盲从任何人， 注意观察模式， 和卖力工作。
I think these are the four principles that go into this.	我认为这四条原则是关键。
And it's that third one, especially, where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves.	尤其是第三条， 对未来的展望 开始自我实现。
What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world, is, I think, only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor.	有趣的是，这种看世界的方式， 我认为，是四种方式中唯一一种 在不同的奋斗领域中能自我实现的。
In comics, I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works.	在漫画界，我知道 它促成了一种严谨的态度， 引导我们尝试明白它的原理。
Then there's another, more classical, attitude which embraces beauty and craft.	然后，还有一种更古典的态度， 囊括美和工艺。
Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content.	还有一种相信内容的纯透明性。
And then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience -- and honesty, and rawness.	还有一种 强调原汁原味的人文体验， 强调诚实和本性。
These are four very different ways of looking at the world.	这是看待世界的四种迥异方式。
I even gave them names.	我还给它们命了名。
The classicist, the animist, and formalist and iconoclast.	古典主义者，泛灵主义者，形式主义者，和标志主义者。
Interestingly, it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung's four subdivisions of human thought.	有趣的是，其恰好和 荣格的四类人类思维相吻合。
And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right; tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.	他们反映了一种二分法：艺术在左， 喜悦在右； 传统在上，革新在下。
And if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth.	在对角线，则是内容和形式， 以及美与真实。
And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art, which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all, or for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme of "Inspired by Nature" -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him, but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die, but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says, "Because it's my nature" -- in that sense, yes.	这同样可以被运用在 音乐、电影、和高雅艺术上， 它们和视觉之间并无关系， 或者说，和我们这次的来于自然的灵感的主题 毫无关系； 除了那个关于青蛙的寓言： 青蛙让蝎子坐在它背上渡河， 条件是蝎子承诺不蛰它， 但蝎子最后还是蛰了它，结果它们都淹死了， 在临死之前，青蛙问为什么，蝎子说： 因为这是我的自然天性 ── 从这个意义上来说，有关系。
So -- so this was my nature.	因此， 这就是我的天性。
The thing was, I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was, I saw it as just this road to discovery.	我曾回顾 我追寻我工作的 这个重心的历程， 以及曾经的我， 我当时认为，那只是一条通往探索的道路。
Actually, it was just me embracing my nature, which means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all.	事实上，我只是在拥抱我的天性， 也就是说 我其实离我父亲的期望并不算远。
So what does a "scientific mind" do in the arts?	那么，在艺术中， 科学思维有何作用呢？
Well, I started making comics, but I also started trying to understand them, almost immediately.	嗯…当我开始画漫画时， 我也几乎同时开始了解漫画。
And one of the most important things about comics, I discovered, was that comics are a visual medium, but they try to embrace all of the senses within it.	我发现，关于漫画最重要的事情之一， 就是：漫画是一种视觉媒介， 但它也尝试将其它感官囊括其中。
So, the different elements of comics, like pictures and words, and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision.	因此，漫画的不同元素，比如说图像和文字， 和不同的符号，以及两者间种种 漫画表现的东西， 都通过视觉这一条途径涉入。
So you have things like resemblance, where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions: abstracted from resemblance, but still retaining the complete meaning, or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan.	因此，你就有了表相， 也就是说代表现实世界的事物， 可以被不同的方式抽象化： 将表相抽象化， 但仍保留完全的含义， 或者将表相和含义两者都抽象化，趋于图形化。
Put all these three together, and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace.	将这三者放在一起，你就有了这一幅有趣的小图， 表现了漫画所能表现的视觉符号 的整个领域。
And if you move to the right you also get language, because that's abstracting even further from resemblance, but still maintaining meaning.	如果你再往右移，就是语言， 因为其将表相进一步抽象化， 但仍旧保留含义。
Vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage, as well.	视觉被用来重现声音 以明白这两者，以及他们的共同来源 之间的共性。
Also, to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals.	也用来重现声音的质感； 用视觉捕捉其关键的特性。
And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics.	漫画中还有可见和不可见事物 的平衡。
Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels, and then gives you something to imagine between the panels.	漫画是一种呼应： 漫画家让你在格子里看到 一些东西， 然后让你在格子之间想象另一些东西。
Also, another sense which comics' vision represents, and that's time.	漫画视觉还表现了 另一种感觉：时间感。
Sequence is a very important aspect of comics.	序列是漫画中重要的一个方面。
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.	漫画表现了一种时间图序。
And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics, but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms, and I found some in history.	这时间图序使得现代漫画充满了活力， 但我猜想它可能也使得 别的艺术形式充满活力， 我在历史中找到了一些。
And you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea.	你能看到同样的原则在这些 古老的版本中支配着相同的主意。
What's happening is, the art form is colliding with the given technology, whether it's paint on stone, like the Tomb of the Scribe in ancient Egypt, or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column, or a 200-foot-long embroidery, or painted deerskin and tree bark running across 88 accordion-folded pages.	事实上，艺术形式随着科技条件 而转变： 在古埃及的墓穴碑文上，它被画在石头上； 在石柱的浮雕上； 在200英尺长的刺绣上； 在88折长的 鹿皮和树皮画上。
What's interesting is, once you hit print -- and this is from 1450, by the way -- all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves: rectilinear panel arrangements, simple line drawings without tone and a left-to-right reading sequence.	有趣的是，当进入印刷时代后 ── 顺带一提，这来自1450年 ── 所有现代漫画的元素一目了然： 直线性格子排列， 简单线条描绘，无色调， 还有由左至右的阅读顺序。
And within 100 years, you already start to see word balloons and captions, and it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here.	接下来100年里， 你已经开始看到对话泡泡和图片说明， 事实上从这到这真的几小步而已。
So I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book, I had to do a little bit of typesetting, and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it, so I bought a computer.	于是，我在1993年写了一本相关的书， 但当我快写完时， 我要做一些排版， 因为我厌倦了跑复印店， 所以我买了一台电脑。
And it was just a little thing -- it wasn't good for much except text entry -- but my father had told me about Moore's Law, about Moore's Law back in the '70s, and I knew what was coming.	那是电脑还很落后，除了文字输入之外用处不大。 但我父亲在70年代曾告诉我摩尔定理， 因此我知道将要到来的是什么。
And so, I kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre-print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond, to post-print comics.	于是，我拭目以待， 看看当我们由前印刷时代漫画， 到印刷时代漫画，再到后印刷时代漫画时 会发生什么。
So, one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound, motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs that were being made in those days.	最先猜想的事情之一， 是我们能够将漫画的视觉因素 与声音、动态、和当时生产的 CD-ROM 的互动性相结合。
This was even before the Web.	这甚至在互联网时代之前。
And one of the first things they did was, they tried to take the comics page as-is and transplant it to monitors, which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology.	他们最先做的事情之一， 是尝试将漫画原封不动地 搬到显示屏上。 这是一个典型的麦克卢恩式错误： 将上一代科技的形式作为 新一代科技的内容
And so, what they would do is, they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages, and they would introduce all this sound and motion.	因此，他们做的是 采用印刷体的漫画页面 并加入声音和动态。
The problem was, that if you go with this idea -- this basic idea that space equals time in comics -- what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion, which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time, then they break with that continuity of presentation.	问题在于，如果你这么做 ── 这基本的空间等于时间的观念 ── 当你加入声音和动态时， 它们本身就是只能通过时间表现的现象， 结果它们会打断表现的连续性。
Interactivity was another thing.	互动性是另一个问题。
There were hypertext comics.	超文本漫画问世了。
But the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here, not here or connected to here; it's profoundly non-spatial.	但超文本的问题 在于超文本中的一切只能是在这，不在这，或者链接到这 ── 非常地没有空间性。
The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny, the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to "Plan 9" to nine lives: it's all the same.	从阿伯拉罕·林肯到林肯硬币， 从 潘尼·马歇尔 到马歇尔计划 到九号计划到九条命： 都是一样的。
And -- but in comics, in comics, every aspect of the work, every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.	但在漫画中， 作品的每个方面，每个元素， 都总和其它的每个元素有着一种空间关系。
So the question was: was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us?	问题在于： 能不能保留那种空间关系， 同时又能利用数据时代 提供给我们的优势？
And I found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that I was showing you.	我在之前的古代漫画中 找到了我个人的答案。
Each of them has a single unbroken reading line, whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right, or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages.	它们每一个都有一条不间断的阅读线， 无论是在墙上迂回， 或是沿圆柱回旋而上， 或者简单地由左至右，或者甚至是在 88折的页面上反向迂回。
The same thing is happening, and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise, but there were compromises when print hit.	同样的事情发生了，那就是当你在空间上移动时， 你也在时间上移动 ── 这个概念被圆满地实现了。 但在印刷时代并非如此。
Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments, so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again.	相邻的空间并不代表相邻的时刻， 于是漫画的基本概念被打断了，一次又一次 一次又一次
And I thought, O.K., well, if that's true, is there any way, when we go beyond today's print, to somehow bring that back?	我想：好吧， 既然如此，是不是有办法， 当我们超越现今的印刷时代， 将那种概念寻回？
Now, the monitor is just as limited as the page, technically, right?	现在，显示屏， 技术上来说，就和页面一样有限，对吧？
It's a different shape, but other than that it's the same basic limitation.	它的形状不同，但除此之外， 它有同样的基本局限。
But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page, but not if you look at the monitor as a window.	但只有当你将显示屏看作页面时才是如此， 如果你将显示屏看作一扇窗口就不同了。
And that's what I proposed: that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas: along the X axis and the Y axis and staircases.	我的提议就是：也许我们能在一幅无限的画布上 创作这些漫画： 沿X轴，Y轴，以及阶梯递进。
We could do circular narratives that were literally circular.	我们能做出名符其实的循环故事。
We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn.	我们能在故事中做出名符其实的转折。
Parallel narratives could be literally parallel.	平行故事可以是名符其实地平行的。
X, Y and also Z.	X，Y，和Z。
So I had all these notions. This was back in the late '90s, and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy, but a lot of people then went on and actually did it.	我的这些看法，成型于90年代后期， 我公司里的其他人认为我是疯子， 但之后很多人真的这么做了。
I'm going to show you a couple now.	我现在向你们展示一些。
This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex.	这是一个叫 Jason Lex 的人画的早期拼贴漫画。
And notice what's going on here.	注意这里。
What I'm searching for is a durable mutation -- that's what all of us are searching for.	我追寻的是一个可持续的转变 ── 那也是我们所有人追寻的。
As media head into this new era, we are looking for mutations that are durable, that have some sort of staying power.	当媒体进入一个新时代时， 我们开始寻找可持续的转变， 一种最终有能力持续下来的转变。
Now, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium, and then we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end.	我们在谈用视觉媒介展现漫画这一基本概念， 然后我们从头到尾将它看下来。
That's that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now.	现在屏幕上显示的是 你刚刚看到的整篇漫画。
But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time, that's just where the technology is right now.	但即使我们现在只能一部分一部分地看， 那也只是因为当今的科技水平。
As the technology evolves, as you get full immersive displays and whatnot, this sort of thing will only grow.	当科技进步， 当有了全面沉浸显示之类后， 这样的东西会愈演愈烈。
It will adapt.	它会适应。
It will adapt to its environment: it's a durable mutation.	 它会适应它的环境： 它是一种可持续的转变。
Here's another one I'll show you. This is by Drew Weing; this is called, "Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe."	接下来一个，Drew Weing 画的 叫做： 《泊普深思宇宙的热寂》。
See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.	看看这里 当我们在一幅无限的画布上画出这些故事时， 你在创造一种对于媒介的本质 更纯粹的体验。
We'll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea.	我们快进一下，你知道大概意思了。
I just want to get to the last panel.	我想给你们看最后一格。
There we go.	来了。
Just one more.	最后一篇。
Talk about your infinite canvas.	关于无限的画布。
It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain.	这是一个名叫 Daniel Merlin Goodbrey 的英国人画的。
Why is this important?	这为什么重要？
I think this is important because media, all media, provide us a window back into our world.	我认为媒介使其尤为重要， 所有媒介 给我们一个通往我们世界的窗口。
Now, it could be that motion pictures -- and eventually, virtual reality, or something equivalent to it -- some sort of immersive display, is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in.	这媒介可以是电影 ── 以及最终，虚拟现实之类的东西 ── 一种沉浸式显示， 给我们最高效地逃避现实世界的方式。
That's why most people turn to storytelling, is to escape.	这就是为什么大多数人喜欢故事，为了逃避。
But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in.	但媒介也给了我们一扇窗口 通往我们生活的世界。
And when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique.	当媒介转变， 媒介的性质变得越来越独特。
Because what you're looking at is, you're looking at comics cubed: you're looking at comics that are more comics-like than they've ever been before.	因为你现在看到的，是多次元的漫画： 你看到的是比之前的一切都更为漫画化的漫画。
When that happens, you provide people with multiple ways of re-entering the world through different windows, and when you do that, it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape.	它们给人们提供了从不同的窗口 重新进入世界的多种方式。 同时，它还使人们三分他们生活的世界， 看清它的形状。
One of many reasons, but I've got to go now.	但我该就此打住了。
Thank you for having me.	谢谢你们。
So, basically we have public leaders, public officials who are out of control; they are writing bills that are unintelligible, and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity, which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.	所以，总的来说我们有些领导人、 政府官员办事出格。 他们写的是无法解读的议案。 从这些议案将会产生出 约40,000页的条文，非常复杂， 其对我们的生活将产生极为不利的影响。
If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits; if you're trying to get a small business loan, you face a blizzard of paperwork.	如果你是从伊拉克或是越南战场回来的老兵， 想得到你的救济金，你得做一大堆棘手的文书工作， 如果你想获得一小笔商业贷款， 你也会面临一大堆棘手的文书工作。
What are we going to do about it?	对此，我们应该如何去做？
I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity, transparency and empathy, building humanity into communications.	我将简单化定义为 一种能达到清晰、 透明和共鸣， 使交流人性化的一种方法。
I've been simplifying things for 30 years.	30年来我一直致力于事物的简化。
I come out of the advertising and design business.	我是做广告和设计的。
My focus is understanding you people, and how you interact with the government to get your benefits, how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with, and how you view brands.	我的关注点是了解大众， 了解你们如何与政府打交道， 去得到你们应得的利益， 了解你们如何与公司打交道而决定你们要与谁去做生意， 以及了解你们如何看待品牌。
So, very quickly, when President Obama said, "I don't see why we can't have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."	所以，当奥巴马总统说 我不明白为什么我们不能有 一份一页的简单英语消费信贷协议时
So, I locked myself in a room, figured out the content, organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.	我把自己关在一个房间里 很快想出了这样一个内容， 制定了这样一个文件，并且是用简单英语写的。
I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country.	我让国内两个顶级 消费信贷律师对其进行了审核。
This is a real thing.	这是件真事。
Now, I went one step further and said, "Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document?	现在我又进了一步， 为什么我们只能有一份纸质文件 并且非要依附于那些墨守成规的律师呢？
Let's go online."	让我们上网去解决。
And many people might need help in computation.	许多人 可能在计算上需要帮助。
Working with the Harvard Business School, you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment: If you spent 62 dollars for a meal, the longer you take to pay out that loan, you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.	与哈佛商学院合作时， 我们有一个关于最低还款额的案例。 你一顿饭花了62美元， 如果你采用最低还款额延期还款的作法， 过了一段时间， 则需还款99美元17美分。
How about that?	你觉得怎么样？
Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?	你认为银行会向人们告知吗？
But it's going to work.	但它就是这样运作的。
It's more effective than just computational aids.	它比仅仅计算 货款时间更有效。
And what about terms like "over the limit"?	你如何理解有些词汇 例如超过限度？
Perhaps a stealth thing.	也许这是一件隐匿的事情。
Define it in context. Tell people what it means.	通过上下文来定义它，告诉人们它是什么意思。
When you put it in plain English, you almost force the institution to give the people a way, a default out of that, and not put themselves at risk.	在你使用简单英语表述时， 你实际上就迫使这家机构 使人们了解如何去规避风险， 而不是把自己置于风险之中。
Plain English is about changing the content.	简单英语也就是 改变内容。
And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM.	我很骄傲的一件事 是我为IBM制作的这份协议。
It's a grid, it's a calendar.	它以简单的网格形式，是一个日历。
At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities, you have responsibilities.	在这个日期，IBM承担责任， 你承担责任。
Received very favorably by business.	这个作法在商务领域被欣然接受了。
And there is some good news to report today.	今天我有好消息要讲。
Each year, one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS.	每年每10个纳税人中有一个 会收到美国国税局通知。
There are 200 million letters that go out.	那就是要发出2亿封信。
Running through this typical letter that they had, I ran it through my simplicity lab, it's pretty unintelligible.	我处理了一部分典型信件， 我是在我的简单化实验室进行的， 结果是它们很让人费解。
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.	文件中所有标红的部分都让人费解。
We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English.	我们又看了1000多封以简单英语写的信， 它们涵盖了70%的业务。
They have been tested in the laboratory.	这些信件在我的实验室进行了测试。
When I run it through my lab, this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible.	当我在我的实验室测试时， 热点图显示每一件事 都是简单易懂的。

There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate.	我们无法再允许政府 按照他们的表达方式进行表达，
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.	我们无法再与协议中 带有隐匿、晦涩难懂条款的公司 做生意。

I thank you.	谢谢大家。
Well, Arthur C. Clarke, a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s, said that, "We overestimate technology in the short term, and we underestimate it in the long term."	亚瑟·查理斯·克拉克， 是上个世纪五十年代的一位著名科幻小说作家， 他曾说：从短期来看，我们高估了科技； 而从长远来看，我们又低估了科技。
And I think that's some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots.	我认为我们担心工作会消失的部分焦虑 来自对人工智能和机器人的恐惧。
That we're overestimating the technology in the short term.	可以说，我们在短时间内正在高估科技。
But I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term.	不过我担心的是，而从长远来看，我们能不能获得所需要的科技。
Because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we, our society, is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future.	因为人口结构的改变真的会留给我们一大堆的工作去做。 我们将不得不依靠机器人的钢铁臂膀去建造我们未来的社会。
So I'm scared we won't have enough robots.	所以我担心未来会没有足够的机器人。
But fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time.	但是担心因科技而丢掉工作的恐惧为时已久。
Back in 1957, there was a Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn movie.	早在1957年，有一部由史宾塞·屈赛和凯瑟琳·赫本主演的电影《电脑风云》。
So you know how it ended up, Spencer Tracy brought a computer, a mainframe computer of 1957, in to help the librarians.	你们一定知道结局如何， 史宾塞·屈赛买了一台电脑，一台1957年的大型电脑， 用来帮助图书管理员。
The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives, "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"	那家公司的图书管理员的工作是回答高管们的问题： 圣诞老人的驯鹿叫什么名字呀？
And they would look that up.	然后他们会去查一查。
And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job.	这台大型电脑会帮他们干那样的活儿。
Well of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn't much use for that job.	当然了，1957年的一台大型电脑根本干不了那样的活儿。
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear.	但是图书管理员们还是担心会丢掉他们的工作。
But that's not what happened in fact.	其实根本没有担心的必要。
The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957.	1957年后很长的一段时间里，图书管理员的工作数量有所提高。
It wasn't until the Internet came into play, the web came into play and search engines came into play that the need for librarians went down.	直到互联网、 网站和各种搜索引擎走进人们的生活， 对图书管理员的需求才开始减少。
And I think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today.	我认为1957年的每一个人都彻底低估了 我们今天的科技水平。比如掌上科技，
And we can just ask: "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"	我们今天可以对着手机说：圣诞老人的驯鹿叫什么名字？
and be told instantly -- or anything else we want to ask.	 问什么都行。
By the way, the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period, because librarians became partners of computers.	顺便说一下，图书管理员们的工资涨得 比美国同期其他工作的工资要快， 因为图书管理员成了电脑们的搭档。
Computers became tools, and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time.	电脑成了工具，图书管理员们有了更多可用工具后， 他们的工作效率大大提高。
Same thing happened in offices.	这种事儿也发生在办公室里。
Back in the old days, people used spreadsheets.	过去，人们使用报表。
Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper, and they calculated by hand.	就是那种纸制棋盘式对照表格， 用于笔算。
But here was an interesting thing that came along.	之后发生了一件有意思的事情。
With the revolution around 1980 of P.C. 's, the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers, not to replace office workers, but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers.	随着二十世纪八十年代的个人电脑革命， 电子表格软件不但没有取代办公室一族， 反倒受到了他们的青睐， 办公族摇身变为程序设计师，
So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets.	他们成了电子表格的程序设计师。
It increased their capabilities.	电子表格增强了他们的能力。
They no longer had to do the mundane computations, but they could do something much more.	办公族再也不用做无聊的笔算， 他们可以做更多的事儿。
Now today, we're starting to see robots in our lives.	如今，我们开始审视机器人在我们生活中的作用。
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot.	左边的是由iRobot公司研发的PackBot机器人。
When soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan, instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick, as they used to do up until about 2002, they now send the robot out.	以前，当士兵们在伊拉克和阿富汗遇到路边炸弹时， 他们会穿上防爆衣并后退，然后用小棍儿去捅炸弹， 在2002年以前他们就是这么干的， 现在，他们会让机器人去搞定。
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs.	可见，机器人接管了危险性工作。
On the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh.	右边的是位于匹兹堡的Aethon公司研制的TUG机器人。
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.	美国有数百家医院正在使用这种机器人。
And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry.	它们把脏布单送进洗衣房；
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.	它们把脏盘子送回厨房；
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy.	它们从药房取药；
And it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients.	而且这种机器人可以让护士和护士助手 从机械无聊的跑腿工作中解脱出来 好腾出他们的时间去照顾病人。
In fact, robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.	事实上，机器人已经存在于我们生活中的许多方面，差不多是无处不在。
But I think when it comes to factory robots, people are sort of afraid, because factory robots are dangerous to be around.	但是，我感觉，工业机器人还是会让人生畏， 因为旁边有工业机器人会让人感觉很危险。
In order to program them, you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions.	因为要想对它们进行编程，你就必须懂得六维向量和四元数。
And ordinary people can't interact with them.	一般人没法与这些工业机器人交互。
And I think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong.	我觉得这种科技走错了方向。
It's displaced the worker from the technology.	因为这种科技取代了工作者。
And I think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with.	我们真正需要的是 那种可以和普通工作者互动的科技。
And so I want to tell you today about Baxter, which we've been talking about.	所以我今天要隆重推荐巴克斯特，它是我们需要的那种工业机器人。
And Baxter, I see, as a way -- a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting.	我认为巴克斯特掀起了第一个机器人浪潮—— 一个普通人可以和工业装置互动的浪潮。
So Baxter is up here.	让我们请出巴克斯特。
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics.	这位是克里斯·哈伯特，他为Rethink Robotics公司工作。
We've got a conveyor there.	那边有个输送带。
And if the lighting isn't too extreme -- Ah, ah!	光线是不是太强了…… 啊！
There it is.	看那儿。
It's picked up the object off the conveyor.	它从输送带上拾起一件东西。
It's going to come bring it over here and put it down.	它把东西拿到这边，然后放下。
And then it'll go back, reach for another object.	完成后，它会回到原位再找另一件东西。
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense.	有意思的是，巴克斯特有个基本的能力。
By the way, what's going on with the eyes?	你可能要问，那对眼睛是怎么回事？
The eyes are on the screen there.	就是它屏幕上的那对眼睛。
The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move.	这对眼睛会瞅着这个机器人的移动方向。
So a person that's interacting with the robot understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions.	这样，人们就可以和这个机器人互动 明白会朝什么地方移动，而不会被它的动作吓着。
Here Chris took the object out of its hand, and Baxter didn't go and try to put it down; it went back and realized it had to get another one.	克里斯现在从它的手中拿走东西， 巴克斯特没有去和克里斯争执。
And Baxter's safe to interact with.	和巴克斯特互动是安全的。
You wouldn't want to do this with a current industrial robot.	但你肯定不敢和生产线上的工业机器人互动。
But with Baxter it doesn't hurt.	巴克斯特很温柔。
It feels the force, understands that Chris is there and doesn't push through him and hurt him.	它能感觉到外力，知道克里斯在旁边 而且不会硬去推他或伤害他。
But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface.	最有意思的是巴克斯特的用户界面。
And so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now.	现在克里斯要过来握住巴克斯特的另一只手。
And when he grabs an arm, it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen.	当他握住它的手时，它会进入零力重力补偿模式 各种图案会显示在它的屏幕上。
You can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm.	你可以看到屏幕左边有一些图标，就是我们的右边。
He's going to put something in its hand, he's going to bring it over here, press a button and let go of that thing in the hand.	克里斯要把一件东西塞到它的手里，他要把它挪到这儿， 按一下按钮，然后放下手里的东西。
And the robot figures out, ah, he must mean I want to put stuff down.	这个机器人明白了，啊，他是想让我把东西放下。
It puts a little icon there.	它在那个位置上放一个小图标。
He comes over here, and he gets the fingers to grasp together, and the robot infers, ah, you want an object for me to pick up.	克里斯走过来，他把机器人的手指握起来， 机器人会推断，啊，你想让我拾起一件东西。
That puts the green icon there.	然后在那个位置放一个绿色图标。
He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.	他会划出机器人应该拾东西的区域。
It just moves it around, and the robot figures out that was an area search.	机器人会在那个区域搜索要拾的东西。
He didn't have to select that from a menu.	克里斯其实不用从菜单里选择。
And now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking.	现在他得在后面训练那件东西的视觉显示 我们在前面继续讲。
So as we continue here, I want to tell you about what this is like in factories.	我们继续， 我想告诉你们这个机器人在生产车间里的使用情况。
These robots we're shipping every day.	我们每天都会运出这些机器人。
They go to factories around the country.	它们会被送往全国各地的生产车间。
This is Mildred.	这位是米尔德蕾。
Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.	米尔德蕾是康涅狄格州一家工厂的工人。
She's worked on the line for over 20 years.	她已经在生产线上工作了20年。
One hour after she saw her first industrial robot, she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory.	在她见到她的第一个工业机器人的一个小时候后， 她就已经给它布置了车间里的一些活儿。
She decided she really liked robots.	她于是喜欢上了机器人。
And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand.	因为机器人可以帮她干以前要她去做的那些简单重复的活儿。
Now she's got the robot doing it.	现在，她可以让机器人去搞定。
When we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better, one of the questions we asked them was, "Do you want your children to work in a factory?"	我们第一次到生产车间里和人们交谈的时候 就是谈谈我们怎么才能让这些机器人和它们更好的互动， 我们问的其中一个问题是， 你们想不想让你们的孩子在工厂里工作？
The universal answer was "No, I want a better job than that for my children."	异口同声的回答是：不想，我想让我的孩子有份比那种好的工作。
And as a result of that, Mildred is very typical of today's factory workers in the U.S.	可想而知，米尔德蕾是典型的 美国当今的工厂工人。
They're older, and they're getting older and older.	这些工人日渐衰老。
There aren't many young people coming into factory work.	但是没有多少年轻人到工厂工作。
And as their tasks become more onerous on them, we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with, so that they can be part of the solution, so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S.	她们的工作任务变得更加繁重， 我们需要提供能够协同配合他们工作的工具， 这样，这些工人就能成为解决方案的一部分， 他们能继续工作，美国就能继续生产。
And so our vision is that Mildred who's the line worker becomes Mildred the robot trainer.	我们的目标是让像米尔德蕾这样的生产线上的工人 成为机器人培训师。
She lifts her game, like the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do.	米尔德蕾成为了机器人时代的玩家， 就像二十世纪八十年代的办公族成为了个人电脑时代的玩家那样。
We're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use.	我们不会交给他们那种要花几年时间去学才能上手的工具。
They're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes.	这些工具只需他们花几分钟时间就能上手。
There's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable.	有两个咄咄逼人但却无法避免的强大力量，
That's climate change and demographics.	就是气候变化和人口结构的变化。
Demographics is really going to change our world.	人口结构的变化真的会改变我们的世界。
This is the percentage of adults who are working age.	这是适龄工作成年人的百分比。
And it's gone down slightly over the last 40 years.	在过去的40年里，这一百分比略有下降。
But over the next 40 years, it's going to change dramatically, even in China.	但是在未来40年里，这一百分比会发生巨大变化，即使是在中国。
The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically.	适龄工作成年人的百分比急剧下降。
And turned up the other way, the people who are retirement age goes up very, very fast, as the baby boomers get to retirement age.	从另一种方面来看，退休年龄的人数急剧上升， 因为在婴儿潮时代出生的人都到了退休年龄。
That means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services.	这意味着，将有越来越多的人拿到更少的社会保障金 去争取有限的服务。
But more than that, as we get older we get more frail and we can't do all the tasks we used to do.	不仅如此，上了年纪以后，我们的身体也会变得更加虚弱 我们就不能再做以前能做的事儿。
If we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers, before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older.	如果看看护理人员的年龄统计数据， 就会发现护理人员的年龄越来越大。
That's happening statistically right now.	这是统计学所得出来的结论。
And as the number of people who are older, above retirement age and getting older, as they increase, there will be less people to take care of them.	随着年龄的增长，会有许多人超过退休年龄，而且他们的年纪会越来越大， 就会有越来越少的人能照顾他们。
And I think we're really going to have to have robots to help us.	我觉得，我们真得找机器人帮忙。
And I don't mean robots in terms of companions.	我不是说找机器人伴侣，
I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older.	而是说让机器人帮我们干我们平时干的那些活儿 那些我们上年纪的时候干不好的活儿。
Getting the groceries in from the car, up the stairs, into the kitchen.	什么把买的东西从车里拿出来呀，拿上楼呀，送进厨房之类的活儿。
Or even, as we get very much older, driving our cars to go visit people.	甚至是，当我们年事已高的时候， 让机器人开车带我们去串门。
And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution.	我认为，机器人可以给那些上了年纪的人获得尊严的机会， 因为他们可以控制机器人解决方案。
So they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them.	他们也就不用依靠越来越少的人去帮助他们。
And so I really think that we're going to be spending more time with robots like Baxter and working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives. And that we will -- Here, Baxter, it's good.	我真觉得，我们可以和机器人和谐共处更长的时间， 和像巴克斯特这样的机器人 在我们的生活中一起干活儿。 噢也，巴克斯特！
And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years as part of our everyday lives.	在未来40年里，我们都回需要机器人的帮助 让它们在日常生活中发挥作用。
Thanks very much.	非常感谢！
When I was growing up in Montana, I had two dreams.	我在蒙太拿长大 有两个梦想
I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.	一个是成为古生物学家 研究恐龙的古生物学家 一个是拥有一个小恐龙作为宠物
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life.	这是我整个生命中 工作的动力
I was very fortunate early in my career.	我很幸运 在我职业生涯的早期
I was fortunate in finding things.	我在发掘方面 很走运
I wasn't very good at reading things.	我不擅长于阅读
In fact, I don't read much of anything.	事实上，我并不读什么文献
I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do.	我在阅读方面有障碍 阅读对我来说是最难的事
But instead, I go out and I find things.	但是我走出去，发掘东西
Then I just pick things up.	我就能获得信息
I basically practice for finding money on the street.	基本上我是靠在街上捡钱来训练的
And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things.	我对山陵感兴趣 也发现了一些东西
And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests, the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones.	特别幸运的是 我发现了西半球上第一个恐龙蛋 第一个还在巢中的恐龙宝宝 第一个恐龙胚胎 还有数量巨大的恐龙骨头
And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years.	那时刚好是 人们开始认识到 恐龙并不是笨重的爬虫的时期 人们从前这样想了很多年
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.	那时大家开始觉得 恐龙其实挺特别的
And so, at that time, I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues.	所以那时候 我有机会试验很多理论 当然还有我的同僚们
We were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young, brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds.	我们能够证明 恐龙——从我们有的证据来看—— 恐龙能建巢 群居生活 能够照料幼小宝宝 捕食回巢给宝宝吃 迁移的时候是大群一起走的
So it was pretty interesting stuff.	这些都很有趣
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.	我还进一步发现 恐龙其实是非常社会性的动物
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.	我们有很多证据 说明恐龙在从少年到成年的期间 变化巨大
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals.	它们的外表很不一样—— 这在社会性的动物中可见
In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults.	在动物的社会群体中 少年们总是和成年动物看起来不一样的
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults.	这样成年动物就能认出少年动物 少年们也能认出成年动物
And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like.	我们这样就对恐龙是什么样的动物 有了一个宏观的看法
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.	它们并不是仅仅乱追吉普车的
But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.	我想正是这社会性 引起了迈克尔·克赖顿的兴趣
And in his book, he talked about the social animals.	在他的书里，他讲到了这个社会性
And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures.	接着斯蒂文·斯皮尔伯格，当然了 把恐龙们描绘成 非常社会性的动物
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."	他们故事的主题是重造恐龙 这样我们就有了侏罗纪公园的故事
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.	迈克尔·克赖顿其实是第一批人 开始谈论怎么重新让恐龙复生的
You all know the story, right.	你们都知道这个故事吧
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."	我指假设每个人都看过侏罗纪公园
If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out.	如果你想造出个恐龙 你出去找一块石化的天然树脂—— 也就是所谓的琥珀—— 找一个有吸血昆虫的 质量好的 这样你有了昆虫，就钻个洞进去 吸出一些DNA 当然了，因为那时候所有的吸血昆虫 都吸的是恐龙的DNA
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it.	你把DNA拿回实验室 克隆一把
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.	我猜是通过把DNA注射到一个鸵鸟蛋里 或者别的什么大蛋 你就等吧 运气好的话，小恐龙就破壳而出啦
And everybody's happy about that.	皆大欢喜
And they're happy over and over again.	皆大欢喜一次又一次之后
Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire.	这么多恐龙就社交起来啦 社会性十足 它们聚到一起 密谋策反
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.	当然了，这就成就了斯蒂文·斯皮尔伯格的电影—— 造反的恐龙把人追得到处跑
So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos.	我假定每个人都知道 如果你真的拿一块琥珀，有昆虫的 钻个洞 得到一些原料 克隆一把，重复做这件事 你只能得到一屋子的蚊子
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.	可能还不济一些树木
Now if you want dinosaur DNA, I say go to the dinosaur.	你想要恐龙的DNA 就要在恐龙身上找
So that's what we've done.	这正是我们的策略
Back in 1993 when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur, and we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.	回溯到1993年，当这个电影开始放映时 我们其实已经拿了国家科学基金， 在试图从恐龙化石中提取DNA 我们选了图上左边的恐龙 是个暴龙化石，保存得很好的标本
And one of my former doctoral students, Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing.	我当时的一个博士生 现在是玛丽·施韦策博士了 有做类似研究的 基础
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there.	所以她在这个暴龙的骨头里 一条大腿骨里 找到了 一些非常有趣的组织
They found these red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world, like red blood cells.	他们发现了红色的，圆形的东西 特别像 红细胞
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.	它们正好在 血管里 在骨头中间
And so she thought, well, what the heck.	所以她就想，不如一试
So she sampled some material out of it.	她提取了一些组织出来
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.	这些不是DNA，她没找到DNA
But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin.	但是她发现了原血红素 正是血红素 的基础
And that was really cool.	这是个大发现
That was interesting.	非常有趣
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.	这可是六千五百万年前的原血红素
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.	我们试了很久 没得到任何结果
So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project.	几年过去了 我们开始了地狱溪计划
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them.	这个地狱溪计划是一场大发掘 目的是挖出尽量多的恐龙化石 希望发现一些恐龙化石 是有更多的遗传物质的
And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.	在蒙太拿东部 那里有很多空地，很多不毛之地 没有什么居民 你可就出去找到很多东西
And we did find a lot of stuff.	我们也的确发现了很多东西
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex.	我们发现了很多暴龙化石 其中一种很特殊 叫做B型暴龙
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.	B型暴龙是在 一片上千立方的岩石群下发现的
It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex.	这并不完全是暴龙 也不是特别大的暴龙 但是这是一种十分特殊的B型暴龙
And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16.	我和同事们把化石切开 我们能够确定 从看骨头里的生长线， 这个B型暴龙是十六岁时死的
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet.	我们并不知道恐龙一般活多久 因为我们还没找到最老的
But this one died at the age of 16.	但是这只恐龙在十六岁时死去
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone.	我们把样本给玛丽·施韦策 她能确定 这个B型暴龙是雌性 因为骨头里 的髓状组织的样子
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant.	髓状组织全是积累的钙 也就是钙库 动物怀孕时会产生 鸟类怀孕时也会产生
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.	这是一个把鸟类 和恐龙连起来的特征
But Mary went further.	玛丽继续探索
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.	她把骨头放入酸中
Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left.	我们知道骨头已经变成化石了 所以把化石放在酸里 应该会全溶解
But there was something left.	但是这次有些东西不溶
There were blood vessels left.	它们就是血管
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.	这些是柔韧的，透明的血管
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.	也是第一次在恐龙化石里发现软组织
It was extraordinary.	这非常了不起
But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones.	她还发现了骨细胞 也就是组成骨头的细胞
And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins.	通过不断试验，我们还是没有发现DNA 但是她发现了蛋白质
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.	我们认为—— 仅仅是认为 在组织被发掘出来后，它们就很快降解了
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.	我们认为这些组织降解的很快
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples.	所以我们就在一个十八轮的大方车里 造了个实验室 把实验室带到野外 我们发掘样本的地方
And we did. We got better material.	我们这样做了，也得到了更好的样本
The cells looked better.	细胞看起来更好
The vessels looked better.	血管看起来更好
Found the protein collagen.	胶原蛋白更好
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.	这都很完美
But it's not dinosaur DNA.	但是还是找不到恐龙的DNA
So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast.	我们已经知道 恐龙的DNA，或者说所有的DNA 实在是降解的太快了
We're just not going to be able to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."	我们就是不能够 像电影侏罗纪公园里一样得到DNA
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur.	我们不能用恐龙 来重造恐龙
But birds are dinosaurs.	但是还在鸟类就是恐龙
Birds are living dinosaurs.	鸟类是活恐龙
We actually classify them as dinosaurs.	我们其实把鸟类 归为和恐龙一类
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.	我们现在管恐龙叫非鸟类恐龙 管鸟类叫鸟类恐龙
So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct.	所以这些非鸟类恐龙 就是那些已经灭绝了的大家伙
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.	鸟类恐龙就是我们现代的鸟类
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them.	我们不需要造什么恐龙 我们已经有啦
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.	你们简直就像一帮六年级学生
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."	六年级学生看看我说：这行不通。
"You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."	你尽管叫这个为鸟类恐龙 但是看看真的迅猛龙，那才叫恐龙。
"The chicken is not."	鸡可不那么酷。
So this is our problem, as you can imagine.	这正是我们的问题 你可以想象
The chicken is a dinosaur.	鸡就是恐龙
I mean it really is.	我是说，它真的是
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.	你辩不过我 因为我们是专管分类的人，我们就爱这么分
But the sixth-graders demand it.	但是六年级学生还是不认输
"Fix the chicken."	你得改造鸡。
So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken.	这就是我想告诉你们的 我们是怎么改造鸡的
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken.	我们有几种方法 可以把鸡改造成恐龙
Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools.	因为有进化 我们可以用进化的方法
We'll call them biological modification tools.	我们管它叫生物改良法
We have selection.	我们可以选择
And we know selection works.	我们也知道选择是可行的
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese.	我们从一只狼一样的动物开始 最后得到一个马耳他人
I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification.	我是说，这真的—— 真的是基因改良工程
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.	或者任何其它有趣的好看的小狗
We also have transgenesis.	我们还有转基因技术
Transgenesis is really cool too.	转基因也是很有用的工具
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.	你把一个动物的基因拿出来，放在另一个动物里
That's how people make GloFish.	这就是怎么做荧光鱼的
You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow.	你拿一个荧光的基因 从珊瑚或者水母中来 放在斑马鱼体内 它们就能发荧光
And that's pretty cool.	很奇妙吧
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.	人们用这个赚大钱
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.	现在他们在做荧光兔 荧光很多东西
I guess we could make a glow chicken.	我就想我们可以做个荧光鸡
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.	但是我不认为这能够说服六年级学生
But there's another thing.	还有一个武器
There's what we call atavism activation.	叫做返祖激活
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.	返祖激活 其实就是—— 返祖现象就是重现祖先的特征
You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.	你听过 有些孩子出生时有小尾巴 这就是返祖现象
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen.	有些返祖现象 常常发生
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.	蛇有时有腿
And here's an example.	这就是个例子
This is a chicken with teeth.	这是个生下来有牙齿的鸡
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens.	一个叫马修·海瑞斯的人 在威斯康辛麦迪逊大学工作 发现了如何刺激 牙齿基因的生长 所以他能够让牙齿基因生长 在鸡身上长牙齿
Now that's a good characteristic.	这是个好的特征
We can save that one.	我们能保留这个科技
We know we can use that.	我们能用这个
We can make a chicken with teeth.	我们可以让鸡生牙齿
That's getting closer.	这离恐龙就近了一步
That's better than a glowing chicken.	比荧光鸡要有用
A friend of mine, a colleague of mine, Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms.	我有个朋友，一个同事 在麦克吉尔大学的汉斯·拉尔森博士 在研究返祖现象
And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop, and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.	他研究返祖 是通过研究鸟的胚胎发育 看它们是怎么发育的 他对鸟类的尾巴是怎么消失的感兴趣
He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing.	他同时也对前肢，爪子，和翅膀 的变化感兴趣
He's looking for those genes as well.	他也研究有关的基因
And I said, "Well, if you can find those, I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."	我说：如果你能找到这些基因， 我就能靠让它们倒行逆施， 得到六年级学生要求的恐龙鸡
And so he agreed.	他同意了
And so that's what we're looking into.	这就是我们研究的东西
If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.	如果你注意恐龙的爪子 迅猛龙 有特殊的手掌，末端有爪子
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand.	始祖鸟，其实是鸟，一个鸟类的先祖 还有着先祖的手掌
But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing.	但是你可以看到，鸽子 或者鸡，或者其它任何一个鸟类 都有这样怪怪的手掌 因为手变成了翅膀
But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.	但是有趣的是 如果你看它们的胚胎 在胚胎发育的时候 州长其实看起来像是 始祖鸟的手掌
It has the three fingers, the three digits.	三个手指，三个脚趾
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.	但是后来一个基因开始运作，使得手指脚趾都混合在一起了
And so what we're looking for is that gene.	我们就在找这个基因
We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, like the archaeopteryx.	我们希望防止这个基因运作 不让手掌混合在一起 我们就能得到三个手指的鸡 就像始祖鸟一样
And the same goes for the tails.	对尾巴也一样
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.	鸟类其实 有没发育完的尾巴
And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail.	我们知道 在胚胎中 当动物发育时 有个其实很长的尾巴
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.	但是一个基因开始运作 消融了尾巴，它就消失了
So that's the other gene we're looking for.	这就是我们在找的另一个基因
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.	我们希望防止尾巴被消融
So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus.	所以我们试图做的 是拿一只鸡 改造它 并造出鸡恐龙
It's a cooler-looking chicken.	这鸡看起来就酷多了
But it's just the very basics.	但是这只是非常基本的改造
So that really is what we're doing.	这就是我们在做的东西
And people always say, "Why do that?	人们总是问：为什么做这个？
Why make this thing?	为什么造那个？
What good is it?"	有什么好处？
Well, that's a good question.	这是个好问题
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things.	事实上，我想这是教孩子 进化论和发育生物学 和其它很多东西 的最好方法
And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece.	坦白说我认为 如果肯德基山德士上校 当年想得开阔一些，他的措辞留心一下 说不定也能为鸡恐龙作上额外广告
Anyway -- When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design.	总之—— 当我们的恐龙鸡孵化时 会变成海报明星宝宝 或者你可以称它海报明星鸡宝宝 代言科技，娱乐和设计
Thank you.	谢谢大家
Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment.	马尔科：今天我要向大家展示 一项正在进行中的实验
Today's its debut.	今天是首演
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.	这将是现实被增强的一个示范
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.	大家将要看到的画面并非提前录制
They are live and reacting to me in real time.	这是现场表演 跟我之间是即时互动
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.	我喜欢把它看成一种科技魔术
So fingers crossed.	祝我好运
And keep your eyes on the big screen.	请大家锁定大屏幕
Augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer-generated imagery.	增强现实 是依靠电脑生成的图像 而与真实世界融为混合体
It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask, why, in a technological age, we continue to have this magical sense of wonder.	这似乎是窥探魔术 的最佳途径 同时也向人们提问 在科技时代人们为何仍旧 对魔幻保有如此的感知力
Magic is deception, but it is a deception we enjoy.	魔术是一种骗术 但却令人享受
To enjoy being deceived, an audience must first suspend its disbelief.	要享受这种欺骗 观众必须首先 放弃怀疑
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind.	第一次提出这种接受心态的 是诗人塞缪尔·泰勒·柯勒律治
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that, for a moment, constitutes poetic faith.	柯勒律治说：我在写作中努力传达一种真理的假象 为想象力的影子 带来放弃怀疑的意愿 这样，在某个片刻 它们便能构成诗意的信念
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience.	马尔科：对任何一种剧场的经验来说 这种虚幻的信念都至关重要
Without it, a script is just words.	没有这种信念 脚本就只是一堆字词
Augmented reality is just the latest technology.	增强现实 是最新的科技
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity.	我手中的技巧 只是一种灵巧的 艺术的展示
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.	我们都很擅长放弃怀疑
We do it every day, while reading novels, watching television or going to the movies.	每天如此 我们读小说 看电视 或者去看电影
We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had.	我们自愿进入虚拟的世界 在那里崇拜英雄 为从不曾有的朋友哭泣
Without this ability there is no magic.	没有这种能力 也就没有魔术
It was Jean Robert-Houdin, France's greatest illusionist, who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller.	让·罗伯特·胡迪 法国伟大的魔术师 第一次发现魔术师 可以成为说书人
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.	他的话就刻在我工作室的墙上
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.	让·罗伯特·胡迪：魔术师不是骗子
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.	而是表演魔术的演员
MT: Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story.	马尔科：这说明魔术是一场戏剧 一招一式 都是故事
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.	魔法的招数 遵循叙事小说的原型
There are tales of creation and loss, death and resurrection, and obstacles that must be overcome.	故事有创造，有失败 有死亡，有复活 还有必须攀越的障碍
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.	现今很多故事的戏剧性都很强
Magicians play with fire and steel, defy the fury of the buzzsaw, dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape.	魔术师玩弄烈火钢刀 挑战电锯金刚的狂怒 有勇气手接子弹 并试图从死亡线逃离
But audiences don't come to see the magician die, they come to see him live.	但是观众却未曾见到魔术师的死亡 他们总安全无事
Because the best stories always have a happy ending.	因为最好的故事 总以快乐结尾
The tricks of magic have one special element.	魔术的诀窍在于一种特殊的元素
They are stories with a twist.	即是故事的离奇性
Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines.	爱德华·德·博诺说 人们的大脑是一种图形匹配的机器
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think.	他说，魔术师很谨慎地发掘 观众的想法
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error.	爱德华·德·博诺：舞台魔术基本上 全部仰仗动量的误差
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable, but do not, in fact, match what is being done in front of them.	观众被引导做出种种假设或构思 看似十分合理 但事实上 却和魔术师展示大相径庭
MT: In that respect, magic tricks are like jokes.	马尔科：在这方面 魔术和笑话很像
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination.	笑话带人们上路 指向一个预期的终点
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected, we laugh.	当我们想象的场景突然转变 完全出乎意料 我们就会大笑
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks.	人们观看魔术 也是这样
The finale defies logic, gives new insight into the problem, and audiences express their amazement with laughter.	压轴的地方 不合逻辑 在同一问题上给出全新的见解 观众的惊愕 变成哈哈大笑
It's fun to be fooled.	被愚弄是很有趣的
One of the key qualities of all stories is that they're made to be shared.	故事最重要的特点之一 就是创造之后的分享
We feel compelled to tell them.	我们总是迫不及待地想要讲述
When I do a trick at a party -- that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again.	每当我在晚会上表演魔术-- 那个人就立即拉他的朋友过来 叫我再演一次
They want to share the experience.	他们想分享这种经历
That makes my job more difficult, because, if I want to surprise them, I need to tell a story that starts the same, but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist.	但这让表演变得越来越难 因为，如果我想给他们惊喜 我讲的故事开头相同 但结尾却必须不同-- 招数有所改变 改变就在其中
It keeps me busy.	这搞的我很忙
Now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.	专家们在今天相信 出人意料的故事给人带来欢乐
We think in narrative structures.	我们按照叙事的结构思考
We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood.	把事件和情感相连 几乎同时将之转化 变成容易理解的故事线
It's a uniquely human achievement.	这是人类的独特才能

Today, thanks to technology, we can share those stories as never before, by email, Facebook, blogs, tweets, on TED.com.	今天，感谢科技 故事可以通过不同以往的方式分享 比如电子邮件，脸谱网， 博客，微博 TED.com
The tools of social networking, these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story.	社交网络工具 成为一种数字式的营火 观众聚集在其周围 倾听我们的故事
We turn facts into similes and metaphors, and even fantasies.	我们赋予事实明喻或暗喻 甚至幻想

Hi.	大家好！
I did that for two reasons.	我这样做有两个原因
First of all, I wanted to give you a good visual first impression.	第一 我想在视觉上给你们 一个良好的第一印象
But the main reason I did it is that that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic.	但其实我这样做的主要原因 是我被强迫戴上 这个Lady Gaga风的古怪麦克风
I'm used to a stationary mic.	我习惯固定式麦克风
It's the sensible shoe of public address.	那才是公开场合演讲标配
But you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens.	但是 我头上被卡上这个东西后 怪事发生了
I just become skanky.	我也变得怪里怪气了
So I'm sorry about that.	对不住大家
And I'm already off-message.	我都跑题了
Ladies and gentlemen, I have devoted the past 25 years of my life to designing books.	女士们 先生们 我花了二十五年的宝贵光阴 致力于设计书本
("Yes, BOOKS.	对，书。
You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper.	就是把一沓上面有墨水的纸订一起。
You cannot turn them off with a switch.	你不能用开关关掉它。
Tell your kids.") It all sort of started as a benign mistake, like penicillin.	记得告诉你孩子。 其实我干这行也是无心插柳柳成荫 就跟当初发现青霉素似的
What I really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in New York City.	我本来想的是 成为纽约市 一家大型设计公司的美术编辑
But upon arrival there, in the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews, I found that the only thing I was offered was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf, a book publisher.	当时的情形是 1986年秋天 在经历了大批的面试之后 我唯一接到的聘书就是 阿尔弗雷德•克诺夫出版社的艺术总监助理 那是一家图书出版商
Now I was stupid, but not so stupid that I turned it down.	我承认我当时的确挺蠢的 但还没有蠢到让自己失业
I had absolutely no idea what I was about to become part of, and I was incredibly lucky.	我压根不知道 我到底要干啥 不过我真的太走运了
Soon, it had occurred to me what my job was.	很快 我就知道我的工作是什么了
My job was to ask this question: "What do the stories look like?"	我的工作就是问这个问题： 这些故事看上去像什么？
Because that is what Knopf is.	因为这就是克诺夫的风格
It is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.	它是个故事工厂 世上最好的故事工厂之一
We bring stories to the public.	我们把故事带给公众
The stories can be anything, and some of them are actually true.	故事五花八门 有一些是真有其事
But they all have one thing in common: They all need to look like something.	但他们有一个共同点： 他们需要看上去像个什么玩意儿
They all need a face.	它们需要一副面孔
Why?	为什么呢?
To give you a first impression of what you are about to get into.	 就是给你 即将步入的世界一个第一印象
A book designer gives form to content, but also manages a very careful balance between the two.	书籍设计师用形式来表达内容 同时 还要非常小心地使两者平衡
Now, the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University, the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard, and wrote the word "Apple" underneath, and he said, "OK.	犹记得 我在宾州州立大学平面设计培训的第一天 我的老师，Lanny Sommese，走进教室 在黑板上画了一张苹果的图片 在下面写上苹果 他说，第一堂课，听好了啊。
Listen up."	
And he covered up the picture and he said, "You either say this," and then he covered up the word, "or you show this.	他把图片盖上，又说 你们要么说这个，接着他又把字盖上 要么画这个
But you don't do this."	不能两者同时出现。
Because this is treating your audience like a moron.	因为那样的话就是把观众当弱智啊
And they deserve better.	（笑) 观众可不是弱智
And lo and behold, soon enough, I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Knopf.	你瞧 很快 我就能把这个理论 试用到我为克诺夫设计的两本书上
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs, and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.	第一本是凯瑟琳·赫本的回忆录 第二本是玛琳·黛德丽的传记
Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style, it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.	赫本的书 是用非常口语化的语言写就的 就像她坐在桌子对面跟你聊天一样
The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter; it was a biography.	黛德丽的书是一本以她女儿 的视角所观察出的一部传记
So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.	赫本的故事是用语言 黛德丽的故事是用图画，所以我们做了这个
So there you are.	你们来看
Pure content and pure form, side by side.	单纯的内容和单纯的形式，肩并肩
No fighting, ladies.	好好相处哟,两位女士
Now, what is the story here?	什么是侏罗纪公园？ 是一个什么样的故事呢？
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber.	有人 从史前时代的琥珀里 提取了恐龙的DNA 把恐龙复活了。
Genius!	小伙儿你行！
Now, luckily for me, I live and work in New York City, where there are plenty of dinosaurs.	有一点幸运的是 我在纽约市居住和工作 那儿的恐龙可是相当多啊
So, I went to the Museum of Natural History, and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop, and I bought a book.	然后 我去了自然历史博物馆 在那好好看了看恐龙骨架，然后我又去了礼品店 在那买了一本书
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book, and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.	我特别喜欢书中的这一页 更具体点就是右下角那张图
Now I took this diagram, and I put it in a Photostat machine, and I took a piece of tracing paper, and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast -- -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters -- and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.	我选了这个图 我把它放到复印机里 我又取了一张描图纸 我用一片透明胶带 把它贴到复印机上——如果我讲得太快了请告诉我—— 我又拿出一支绘图笔—— 告诉那边的小伙子那是啥—— 然后我就开始重建恐龙了
I had no idea what I was doing, I had no idea where I was going, but at some point, I stopped -- when to keep going would seem like I was going too far.	我其实不知道自己在做什么 也不知道会整出个啥玩意儿 但做了一会儿之后，我觉得我得停了—— 再做下去看来有点太过火
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being.	最终我们看到的 图形中的动物是这个样子
We're in the middle of the process.	这还没完
And then I just threw some typography on it.	我又稍作了一点后期加工
Very basic stuff, slightly suggestive of public park signage.	简单弄了一下 顺便影射了一下咱们公园的标识有多简陋
Everybody in house loved it, and so off it goes to the author.	出版社里人都挺喜欢它的 于是它就被送到作者那里去了
And even back then, Michael was on the cutting edge.	即使在当时 迈克尔说话也挺潮的
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.	迈克尔·克莱顿在传真里回复到： 擦！这书封他妈的太帅了 看见这张传真从机器里出来的时候我才真正安心了
I miss Michael.	我真想迈克尔
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image, just in case they might want to use it.	果然 环球影业有人 打电话到我们法律部 问是否能买到这张图的版权 以备将来之用
Well, they used it.	好吧，他们最后真的用了
And I was thrilled.	我当时很激动
We all know it was an amazing movie, and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it.	我们都知道那是一部很棒的电影 而且看到这成了一种文化 成了一种现象 还有各种衍生品 还真挺有意思的
But not too long ago, I came upon this on the Web.	但就在不久前 我在网上无意看见这个图
No, that is not me.	那可不是我噢
But whoever it is, I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like, "Oh my God, that wasn't there last night.	但 不管是谁 我禁不住会想 他们要是有天醒过来叫 天哪，昨晚这可还啥也没的呀。
Ooooohh!	啊啊啊啊啊！
I was so wasted."	我算是完蛋了。
But if you think about it, from my head to my hands to his leg.	想想 这个图画经由我的脑袋 到我的手最后到了他腿上
That's a responsibility.	这还真是种责任
And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.	不过这是种我不能轻易担当的责任
The book designer's responsibility is threefold: to the reader, to the publisher and, most of all, to the author.	图书设计师有三重责任 对读者 对出版商 最重要的是对作者
I want you to look at the author's book and say, "Wow!	我希望你看到该作者的书 会说，哇！
I need to read that."	我得看看这本书。
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers, and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony.	大卫·塞达斯是我最喜欢的作家之一 这本合集的文章标题 是关于他的裸体主义殖民地之旅的
And the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image, and he wanted to explore what was underlying that.	他去的原因是 他害怕自己身体的样子 他想探究一下原因所在
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of.	但这本书对我的意义是 我终于有机会 设计一本能脱裤子的书了
But when you do, you don't get what you expect.	但即使你真这样做了 你也不见得就能看见你想看的
You get something that goes much deeper than that.	你得到的东西要深刻得多
And David especially loved this design because at book signings, which he does a lot of, he could take a magic marker and do this.	大卫特别喜爱这个设计 因为在他做的很多书籍签名会上 他会拿支神奇的马克笔然后画个这玩意儿
Hello!	喂！
Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.	奥古斯丁·巴勒斯写过一本传记 叫做《干燥》 记述了他在康复的事经历
In his 20s, he was a hotshot ad executive, and as Mad Men has told us, a raging alcoholic.	他20几岁时 就成为一位相当成功的广告公司主管了 不过像《广告狂人》里一样，他是个疯狂的酒鬼
He did not think so, however, but his coworkers did an intervention and they said, "You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."	他本人并不以为然 不过他的同事都劝他说 你要去康复中心，不然，你会被炒鱿鱼，你会死掉的。
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution, what I would call the opposite of Type 101.	对我来说 有一种排版法一直都靠谱 我称之为101型的对立面
What does that mean?	这是什么意思呢？
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography, you get the assignment of, select a word and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?	通常在上印刷术简介课的第一天 你的作业是选一个字 然后把这个字写得像它所表达的意思
Very simple stuff.	非常简单
This is going to be the opposite of that.	我这个方法其实就是反着来
I want this book to look like it's lying to you, desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.	我想让这本书看上去像在撒谎 绝望无助地撒谎，就跟酒鬼一样的
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.	我用了你所能想象到的最没技术含量的方法
I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!	我设置了字型 然后用爱普生的 水溶性墨水打印出来 贴到墙上 再把一桶水浇上去 瞬间变样！
Then when we went to press, the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running.	接着我们拿到出版社 打印机在墨水上加了点光泽 看上去真像在往下流
Not long after it came out, Augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books.	出版没多久，奥古斯丁埋伏在一个机场 他藏在一个书店里 偷看谁在买他的书
And this woman came up to it, and she squinted, and she took it to the register, and she said to the man behind the counter, "This one's ruined."	有一位老太太走过来 她瞅了一眼 就把书拿到收款处 对店员说，这本书印坏了。
And the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady.	店员站在柜台后说，我知道，女士。
They all came in that way."	它们来的时候就成这样了。
Now, that's a good printing job.	印刷厂的伙计们干的还真不赖嘛
A book cover is a distillation.	一本书的封面 是书的精华
It is a haiku, if you will, of the story.	也可以说 是这个故事的俳句总结
This particular story by Osama Tezuka is his epic life of the Buddha, and it's eight volumes in all.	手塚治虫 在他写的 菩萨史诗中有一个很特殊的故事 这书总共有8卷。
But the best thing is when it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life of the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.	最棒的是 当它上了你的书架 你就得到了 一排菩萨，而且还是不同年龄段的
All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book, but once the book designer has read the text, then he has to be an interpreter and a translator.	所有这些方案 是从书的内容发掘出来的 而一旦图书设计师读到了内容 他就变成了一位诠释者 和翻译者
This story was a real puzzle.	这个故事才是个真正的谜
This is what it's about.	就是这么回事
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together.	十六世纪奥斯曼法庭画家的阴谋和谋杀。 那好 我就收集了一些画 我看着它们 解构它们 又把它们组合起来

So even though we love publishing as an art, we very much know it's a business too, and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky, that great art can be great business.	即使我们像爱艺术一样爱出版 我们也很清楚 这毕竟也是生意 如果我们做得对 运气又不差的话 那伟大的艺术也能成伟大的生意
So that's my story. To be continued.	这就是我的故事 未完待续
What does it look like?	这故事到底看起来怎么样?
Yes. It can, it does and it will, but for this book designer, page-turner, dog-eared place-holder, notes in the margins-taker, ink-sniffer, the story looks like this.	我知道 这种场景不仅可能 而且正在并且还会继续发生 不过对我这个书籍设计师 读者 旧书的收集者 在书上作批注的人 以及闻墨香的人来说 在我眼中这个故事是这样的
Thank you.	谢谢大家。
Hi everyone. I'm Sirena.	大家好，我叫黄凱珉。
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.	我今年十一岁，来自康涅狄格州。
Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.	嗯，我确实不知道我为什么会在这里。
I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design?	我的意思是，我和这些到底有什么关系 科技，娱乐和设计？
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology but this has nothing to do with that.	好吧，我把我的iPod，手机和电脑都称为科技 但这都和这个没有关系。
So I did a little research on it.	那么我做了一些研究。
Well, this is what I found.	这是我的发现。
Of course, I hope I can memorize it.	当然，我希望我能在这里记得说出来。
The violin is basically made of a wood box and four main strings.	小提琴基本上是用木头块做的。 它有四根主弦。
By playing the string, the string vibrates and produces a sound wave.	通过拉弦，弦产生震动。 结果产生一种声波。
Sound passes through a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified but ... let me think.	声音通过称为琴马的木板 进入木盒，然后得到放大。
On the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length, that changes the frequency of the sound wave.	想起来了，在另一方面 通过把手放在指板的不同位置 它改变弦的长度 这改变声波的频率。
Oh, my gosh!	噢，我的天哪！
Okay.	好吧，这就是所谓的科技。
This is sort of a technology but I can call it a 16th-century technology.	 但我把它叫做十六世纪的科技。
But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still basically based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound.	实际上，我发现最美妙的事是 当时称之为的声音系统 现在叫做声波的传递 现在根本上还是基于同样的原则 来产生和放大声音。
Isn't that cool?	这是不是很酷？
Design -- I love its design.	（鼓掌） 设计—我喜欢小提琴的设计。
I remember when I was little my mom asked me, would you like to play the violin or the piano?	我记得我小的时候 我妈妈问我 你是喜欢拉小提琴还是弹钢琴？
I looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day.	我看看那庞然大物 我自言自语地说 我可不要把我锁在那张板凳上 整整一天。
This is small and lightweight.	这个很小，很轻。
I can play from standing, sitting or walking.	我可以站着、坐着或走着拉。
And you know what?	而且你知道吗？
The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, I can hide it.	最好的事情是如果我不想练习 我可以把它藏起来。
The violin is very beautiful.	小提琴非常美丽。
Some people relate it as the shape of a lady but, whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff that easily looks dated.	有些人把它联系到女人的身材之美 但是无论你喜欢于否 它已经有四百多年的历史， 与那些时髦一时的现代东西相比，它却是百年不衰。
But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, that no two violins sound the same.	但是我认为它因人而异，具有非常独特的品质， 虽然每一把小提琴看起来都很相似 但没有任何两把小提琴发出同样的声音。
Even from the same maker or based on the same model.	即使是出自同一制造者 或基于同一模式。
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment, but actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining.	娱乐—我喜欢娱乐。 可实际上，小提琴本身 并没有什么娱乐性。
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around, it was actually, really bad because it didn't sound like the way I'd heard from other kids -- so horrible and so scratchy -- so it wasn't entertaining at all.	我的意思是，当我开始拉小提琴时 我试着拉，当时的小提琴 事实上声音很不好听 它发出的声音并不像其他孩子那样拉得好听 声音很糟，很刺耳 因此我开始拉的小提琴一点没有娱乐性。
But besides, my brother found this very funny.	尽管如此，我弟弟认为这个很好玩。
Yuk, yuk, yuk.	呀，呀，呀。
A few years later I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.	几年之后，我听到一个笑话 是关于最伟大的小提琴家雅沙·海菲兹的故事。
After Mr. Heifetz's concert a lady came over and complimented, "Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight."	一次海菲兹音乐会之后 一位女士前来恭维， 噢，海菲兹先生，您今晚之小提琴的声音太美妙了。
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, "Funny, I don't hear anything."	海菲兹先生当时很酷 他拿起小提琴，他说， 有意思，我可听不见任何声音。
And now, I realize that as the musician, we human beings, we have a great mind, artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment.	现在，我认识到，作为一个音乐家 我们人类，我们有一个奇妙的大脑， 艺术的心灵和技巧 这些可以改变十六世纪的科技 一个传奇的设计 成为一个美妙的娱乐。
Now, I know why I'm here.	现在，我明白了我为什么会在这里。
At first I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more.	起初，我以为我到这里来只是为了表演 我没有想到是，我却学到和得到更多的东西，
But ... although some of them were quite up there for me.	但是⋯尽管其中的许多东西对我来说都特别深奥。
Like the multi-dimension stuff.	比如多维的东西。
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I can actually get my two dimension correct in school.	我的意思是，坦白地说，我会相当地满足 如果我能在学校里能够明白平面的空间。
But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that ... well, actually, I would also like to stand this for all children is to say, thank you, to all adults for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future world much better.	但事实上，最令人印象深刻的事情对我来说 是这个⋯真的， 我还要在此为所有的儿童 对所有的大人们说一声，谢谢你们 给我们许多真切的关怀 和对我们更美好未来所做的一切努力。
Thank you.	谢谢你们。

PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members.	菲莉斯·罗德里格斯：我想说的是 我从艾莎这里学到了很多， 回首我们初次见面的那天 还有其他家庭的成员-- 这是个受保护的很私下的聚会， 因为当时是2002年11月， 老实说，我们担心国内的那些极端（左翼）爱国主义者-- 那些我们家族成员。

But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.	但她是用这种方式与我们感同身受。 这是，我想说，这是一种冰释前嫌的方式。
And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings.	接下去发生的是，我们全都讲述了自己的故事， 我们作为平等人互相交流着。
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.	在下午结束的时候-- 大概是午餐之后3个小时-- 我们感觉就好像我们永远了解彼此一样。
Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had.	我从她身上学到的， 是作为一个女人，可以变的如此宽容 不但在当时的情况下 那时所发生的， 和她孩子所经历过的遭遇， 而且是她所经历的人生。

I started a site called TreeHugger -- I care about this stuff.	我开了一个叫 Treehugger 的网站 － 抱树网 我很关心这些东西
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third.	我知道光是每天吃一个汉堡 就能增加三分之一的死亡几率
Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider for our own cats, dogs and other pets.	我知道每年我们养殖100亿动物 就为了他们身上的肉 而这些动物生活的那种工厂环境 是我们根本无法想象自己的 猫，或是宠物可以居住的
Environmentally, meat, amazingly, causes more emissions than all of transportation combined: cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.	就环境来说，肉品排放的二氧化碳 神奇的 比所有交通工具的排放量还大 汽车、火车
And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do.	制造肉所使用的水 是蔬菜的一百倍
I also knew that I'm not alone.	我也知道我并不孤单

Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk -- tucking into a big old steak.	但我还是嗯，嗯，嗯 被一块巨大的牛排包围着
So why was I stalling?	我到底在迟疑什么？

Simple.	如此简单
If you want to take it to the next level, remember, the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats.	如果你想更进一步 记得红肉和经处理的肉类 是今日破坏环境和健康的 罪魁祸首

So, please ask yourselves, for your health, for your pocketbook, for the environment, for the animals: What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?	于是，请大家今天自问 为了你的健康 你的财富 为了环境和动物 为什么不试试做个周间的素食者呢？
After all, if all of us ate half as much meat, it would be like half of us were vegetarians.	如果我们所有人都少吃 一半的肉 那就像我们之中有一半人 是素食者一样。
Thank you.	谢谢大家
I'm going to start with a little story.	我来先讲一个小故事
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old, I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete, over four months, slowly wasting away until I was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst.	我在附近的地区长大，我15岁时 在四个月里，我从一个自认为的体格强壮的年轻运动员 逐渐消瘦 直到变成一个饥民 有着永不满足的饥渴感
I had basically digested away my body.	基本上我已经消化光了自己的身体
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip, my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog.	情况严重到，在我的一次背包旅途中 实际上是我的第一次，在西弗吉尼亚的 Old Rag Mountain 我像狗一样 把脸埋在水坑里喝水
That night, I was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.	那天晚上，我被带到急救室 被诊断患有I型糖尿病导致的酮酸中毒
And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine, insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.	后来我康复了，感谢现代医学的奇迹 胰岛素和其它东西， 我的体重全恢复了，还有些增长
And something festered inside me after this happened.	这些事情发生后， 我心里开始有了些想法
What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?	当时我想的是， 糖尿病是什么导致的?
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin.	你们知道， 糖尿病是一种免疫疾病 你的身体攻击正常细胞，当时人们认为 可能在一些情况下，人体接触到病原体 免疫系统被激活，与病原体作斗争 结果杀死了制造胰岛素的细胞
And this is what I thought for a long period of time, and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit, the microbes that do bad things.	对于这个解释，我思考了很长一段时间 这也是医学和大众主要关注的理论 微生物是有害的
And that's where I need my assistant here now.	现在我需要我的助理帮忙
You may recognize her.	你们可能认得她
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks, and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building, and they sell toys, giant microbes.	其实昨天，很抱歉，我没来听一些演讲 我去了一下国家科学院的大楼 楼里有人在卖玩具，巨型微生物
And here we go!	接好了!
So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.	如果你接住那一个，你就已经感染了食肉细菌
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.	显然我的棒球技能已经不比当年了
So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.	所以，不幸的是，也不让人惊奇的是 他们在国家科学院大楼卖的微生物玩具是病原菌
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us, and that's what I was focusing on.	大家都只关注致死的微生物 那也是我当时研究的重点
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes, and those microbes actually do us good much of the time, rather than killing us.	实际上我们正在被厚厚的一层微生物覆盖 而多数情况下, 这些微生物对我们是有益的 而不是有害致死的
And so, we've known about this for some period of time.	而且我们认识到这一点，已经有一段时间了
People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us, I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...	人们用显微镜观察覆盖人体的微生物 我知道你没在听我讲话，但是……
The microbes that cover us.	这些覆盖人体的微生物
And if you look at them in the microscope, you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells.	如果你用显微镜观察它们 你会发现在我们身上的微生物细胞 是人体细胞数量的10倍
There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.	我们身上微生物的质量比我们大脑的质量还重
We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.	我们的身体实际上是一个丰富的微生物生态系统
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms, just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.	不幸的是, 如果你想要研究微生物 仅仅用显微镜观察是不够的
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.	我们刚才听到了DNA测序
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their DNA.	事实证明研究和理解微生物的最好方法之一 是研究它们的DNA
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years, using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places, including the human body, reading the DNA sequence and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place.	这正是我20年来一直在做的事 我通过DNA测序来分析从不同来源采来的样品 其中包括人体样本，测出DNA序列 然后从这些DNA序列中了解 在特定位置的微生物
And what's amazing, when you use this technology, for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered in a sea of microbes.	神奇的是，在使用这个技术时 比如说，研究人体系统 我们不只是被覆盖在数量众多的微生物中
There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.	我们身上的微生物种类也是成千上万的
We have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us.	我们覆盖的微生物种群 有数百类个基因
And so this microbial diversity differs between people, and what people have been thinking about in the last 10, maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes, this microbial cloud in and on us, and the variation between us, may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us.	而且每个人身上的微生物种群各不相同 在过去的10或15年里，人们一直在思考 也许这些微生物 这些人体上覆盖的微生物云 以及人和人之间的微生物差异 对人类的健康和疾病的个体差异有重要影响
And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.	这就回到了我之前和你们说过的糖尿病的故事
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen, but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you.	结果是人们现在认为 一型糖尿病诱因之一并不是与病原体的战争 却是因为它其实在试着 与身体内外的微生物传达错误的信息
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body.	然后这些在我身体内外的微生物群落不知怎么地消失了 这触发了某种免疫反应 让我的身体消灭了自身的 制造胰岛素的细胞
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is, what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques in particular, to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us.	所以在接下来几分钟我想和你们分享的是 人们通过DNA测序技术了解到哪些内容 尤其是对于身体内外的 微生物云
And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.	我想和你们讲一个有关我个人研究课题的故事
My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave, right around the corner from here at Georgetown.	我自己的第一次研究人体微生物的经历 实际上就来自 我在街对角的乔治城大学做的一个演讲
I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk, and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people.	我在那做了个演讲，而乔治城大学医学院的院长 刚好是我的一个家族方面的朋友，去听了演讲 会后他上来和我说，他们正在 做人体回肠移植方面的研究
And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.	他们想要研究移植后的微生物分布情况
And so I started a collaboration with this person, Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.	所以我开始和 Michael Zasloff 和 Thomas Fishbein 合作 观察回肠移植后微生物繁殖情况
And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project.	我可以和你们聊这项研究的所有细节 但是我想给你们讲这个故事的原因是 他们在这个课题开始阶段 做了特别惊人的尝试
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease, and they sterilized the donor ileum.	他们取得捐赠者的回肠，里边充满捐赠者身上的微生物 同时有受赠者，他们体内的微生物菌群可能出了些问题 比如说，克罗恩病患者 然后他们消毒捐赠者的回肠
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.	清除所有的微生物，然后移植到受赠者体内
They did this because this was common practice in medicine, even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea.	他们这样做，因为这是医学上的通用做法 即便它显然 不是一个好主意
And fortunately, in the course of this project, the transplant surgeons and the other people decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.	幸好在这个研究过程中 移植外科医生和其他成员决定 抛开通用做法，我们必须换个办法
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor, and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant.	所以他们留下回肠中的部分微生物菌群 他们留下了捐赠者体内的微生物 理论上说，这可能 对接受回肠移植的人有益
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.	所以，大家，这就是我这些年来所做的研究
In the last few years there's been a great expansion in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.	在过去几年中，通过DNA技术来观察人体内外的微生物研究 有了长足进展
There's something called the Human Microbiome Project that's going on in the United States, and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.	人类微生物菌落项目 正在美国展开 在欧洲, 有人类肠道宏基因组计划和很多其它研究
And when people have done a variety of studies, they have learned things such as, when a baby is born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother.	当他们做了各种研究 他们发现了各种现象，比如一个婴儿 从产道出生时 母体的微生物菌群会移植到婴儿上
There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections, some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal.	剖腹产有一些风险 其中有可能包括错误移植 当婴儿经由剖腹被取出母体 而非从产道生出时, 这有可能发生
And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system, helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism, and determining our metabolic rate, probably determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways.	许多不同研究显示 在我们身体和表面的微生物 对免疫系统的发育有益 帮助击退病原体，促进新陈代谢 决定我们的代谢速度 可能决定我们的体味 还可能在很多方面塑造我们的行为
And so, these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community, this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.	因此这些研究证明或者推断了 这些微生物群落的各种重要功能 这些在我们体内和表面生活的非病原体，这层云的功能
And one area that I think is very interesting, which many of you may have now that we've thrown microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."	有个领域我觉得很有意思 就是既然刚才我们刚扔了一群菌到人群中 你们中间有许多人也许有这个心态, 我叫它恐菌症
So people are really into cleanliness, right?	人们真的很重视清洁, 是吗？
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters, people are washing every part of them all of the time, we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities, we take antibiotics excessively.	我们的厨房桌台上有抗菌用品 人们时时刻刻都在洗身上的每个部分 抗生素大量地流入我们的食物和居住环境中 我们无节制地滥用抗生素
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick, but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.	如果你生病了，杀死病原体是件好事 但我们要知道，当我们把化工产品 和抗生素注入我们的生活中时，我们也在杀死 生活在我们体内和表面的微生物云
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children, has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community.	研究发现，过度使用抗生素，尤其在儿童身上 和肥胖、自身免疫疾病 以及其它各种健康问题都有关 因为抗生素破坏了 人体的微生物群落
So the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not, or we can kill it with antibiotics, but what can we do to restore it?	所以微生物群落可能会出问题 不论我们喜不喜欢 或者我们可以用抗生素杀死这些微生物 但是我们怎样才能重建这些群落?
I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.	我相信在座的许多人听说过益生菌群
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you.	人们可以尝试用益生菌来重建 体内和体表的微生物群落
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.	已经有一些使用益生菌的成功案例
There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat, prevent, necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.	在加州大学戴维斯分校有一项研究 人们尝试用益生菌来治疗和预防 早产儿的坏死性小肠结肠炎
Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.	早产儿身上有不少和微生物群落相关的问题
And it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants.	也许益生菌可以帮助预防 早产儿罹患 这种可怕的坏死性小肠结肠炎
But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.	但是益生菌是一个非常，非常简单的解决方法
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them, and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.	许多你可以吃的药丸或酸奶 含有一或两种，还可能五种细菌 而人体微生物群落包含数千个菌种
So what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?	所以我们怎样才能重建我们的微生物群落 在我们身上有数千种微生物的情况下？
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is, they eat poo -- coprophagia.	好吧，动物们所做的一件事是 它们吃类便——食粪症
And it turns out that many veterinarians, old school veterinarians in particular, have been doing something called "poo tea," not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that, where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.	实际上许多兽医 尤其是老派的兽医 一直在用一种叫粪便茶的东西 不是屁屁，而是粪便茶来治疗 马和牛的腹绞痛和其它类似疾病 就是用健康动物的粪便做成茶 然后喂给生病的动物喝
Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side, and you can put your hand into its rumen, it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system, so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants, where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth, they are delivering a community of probiotics, a community of microbes from a healthy donor, through the other end.	但是，除非你有一头身上装了研究反刍消化装置的牛，肚子一侧开了个大洞 你可以把手伸进它的瘤胃 很难想象从嘴巴经过整个消化道上部 传输微生物 是最好的传输方式 所以你们可能听说过有人在做 粪便移植，与其将少数益生菌种 从口腔传入体内 他们将一个益生菌群 来自一个健康的捐赠者的整个微生物群落 从消化道的另一端送入体内
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years.	事实表明这种做法 对于某些顽固的传染病很有疗效 比如可以在人体内存活多年的 艰难梭状芽孢杆菌感染
Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces, from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic C. dif infections in some people.	粪便移植 从而实现健康捐赠者的粪便中微生物的移植 事实上已经有一些成功治愈系统性艰难梭状芽孢杆菌感染的案例
Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people have come up with this same idea, is that the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.	这些新的移植方法，这些粪便移植 或是粪便茶给我还有很多人以启示 我们有了共同的想法 就是这些在我们体内外的微生物群落，是一个器官
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.	我们应该把它看成一个有功能的器官，看成人体的一部分
We should treat it carefully and with respect, and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness, without some real good justification.	我们应该认真对待它，尊重它 我们不应该在不必要的情况下破坏它的平衡 比如采用剖腹产，使用抗生素 或过度清洁
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.	因为用DNA测序技术，人们可以做详细的研究 就像比较100个克罗恩病患者 和100个没有克罗恩病的人
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little, and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.	或者比较100个在小时候服用过抗生素的人 和100个小时候没服用过抗生素的人
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences.	我们现在可以开始比较他们的微生物群落 和它们的基因来看是否存在差异
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not just correlative differences, but causative.	最终我们可能会弄明白，这些人群间的差异是否 不仅仅是相关的，还有因果关系
Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this, but people are now using these technologies because they've gotten very cheap, to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.	小鼠和其它动物实验模型系统 也正帮助我们研究，但人们现在使用 DNA测序技术是因为成本已经很低 如果要研究不同人体内外的微生物的话
So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is, I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.	所以，总的来说，我想告诉你们的是 我并没有告诉你们我患糖尿病的故事
It turns out that my father was an M.D., actually studied hormones.	实际上我父亲是个医生 他研究内分泌激素。
I told him many times that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.	很多次我和他说 我又累，又渴，感觉不舒服
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."	他耸耸肩，我想，他要么认为 我只是爱抱怨，要么 是一个医生认为我家的小孩不会生病的心态
We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology meeting as family in Quebec.	我们甚至举家前往魁北克 参加国际内分泌学学会
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee, and drinking everybody's water at the table, and I think they all thought I was a druggie.	我每五分钟就要起来尿尿 吃饭时要喝完每个人的水 我想，他们可能都认为我嗑药了
But the reason I'm telling you this is that the medical community, my father as an example, sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.	但我和你们说这个故事的原因是 在医学界，以我的父亲为例 有时候看不到眼前发生的事
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.	这层微生物云，就在我们眼前
We can't see it most of the time.	很多时候我们看不到它。
It's invisible.	它是隐形的
They're microbes. They're tiny.	它们是微生物，微小的生物。
But we can see them through their DNA, we can see them through the effects that they have on people.	但是我们可以通过它们的DNA看到它们 我们可以通过它们对人类的影响看到它们
And what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine.	我们现在需要做的是 开始思考在人类医学每个方面 微生物群落的作用
It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us, but it might.	这并不意味着它会影响我们的每一部分 但是有这个可能性
What we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people, so that we can understand what they're doing to our lives.	我们需要一份人类体内和表面的微生物的实地指南 这样我们才能了解 它们对我们生活的影响
We are them.	我们就是它们。
They are us.	它们就是我们
Thank you.	谢谢
I'd like to start tonight by something completely different, asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.	今晚，我想以一种截然不同的方式作为开始， 请你们和我一起暂时离开陆地， 跳到广阔的大洋中。
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean, and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.	地球生物圈90%的空间在大洋中， 而那就是生命——我们今晚研讨会的主题——那是生命开始的地方。
And it's a lively and a lovely place, but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing, our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland, but also, most recently, with climate change, and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.	这是一个充满活力的可爱的地方， 但却已经发生了巨大的变化—— 不仅仅是因为我们的过度捕捞，不负责任地捕鱼， 以及农田肥料产生的污染， 还有，最近以来，气候变化的威胁。 而史蒂夫·施耐德，我肯定，他将就这个问题做更详细的解读。
Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans, more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.	现在，如果我们继续这样胡乱地修补海洋， 越来越多的报告预言，我们正在使海洋 变得更适合低能量类型的动物，如水母和细菌。
And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.	这也许就是我们将要面对的海洋。
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful, and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday, but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up.	水母很奇异，有催人入睡的魔力，也很美丽， 你们可以在周五的水族馆里看到许多更华丽的， 但它们的刺很可怕，而且水母寿司和水母生鱼片 也不够填饱你的肚子。
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.	100克水母大约等于四卡路里的热量。
So it may be good for the waistline, but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.	因此，它或许有助于减小腰围， 但更可能让你时常忍饥挨饿。
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish.	而且一个只充满了水母的大海 对其他生活在其中的生物来讲也不是一件好事， 除非，有其他捕猎水母的动物存在。
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.	这就是一个贪婪的捕食者正在对这只可怜的，毫无察觉的， 顺水漂流的小水母发起攻击。
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola, whose primary prey are jellyfish.	而这个捕食者就是翻车鱼，Mola mola, 它们的主要食物就是水母。
This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records" for being the world's heaviest bony fish.	在吉尼斯世界纪录中， 这是世界上最重的硬骨鱼，
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.	能达到5000磅重——而它们的食物主要就是水母。
And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish -- that its favorite food is the moon jelly.	这里有个我觉得是很微妙的宇宙学巧合， 翻车鱼，也称为太阳鱼， 它最喜欢的食物是月亮水母。
So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way, even if one is eating the other.	很有趣，太阳和月亮以这样的方式聚到一起了， 即使是吃与被吃的关系。
Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name.	现在，这是你们看到翻车鱼的一般情形， 这就是它们被叫做太阳鱼的原因。
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.	原来它们喜欢日光浴，不能责备它们。
They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior, they lie out and bask on the surface.	它们只是摆平了浮在海面上， 而大多数人以为这是病态或懒惰，但这只是一种典型的行为， 它们就是喜欢摆平了在海面上晒太阳。
Their other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian, but it's actually Latin for millstone, and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.	它们的另一个名字，Mola mola，听起来像夏威夷语， 实际上却是拉丁语中磨石的意思， 这与它们那圆形，很怪异，似乎被切割了一样的形状有关。
It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.	它们，就好比，在生长的时候忘记了尾巴部分。
And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place, was this terribly bizarre shape.	实际上，让我对翻车鱼感兴趣的首要原因， 就是这种即为奇怪的形状。
You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek, and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength, and then you look at the sunfish.	大家知道，鲨鱼，它们是流线型的，很优美， 还有金枪鱼，就像鱼雷一样， 它们没有日程安排，它们就代表着迁徙和力量， 然后你们再看看翻车鱼。
And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.	这实在是太匪夷所思了， 比起，譬如金枪鱼，它确实有点，优势差得太多了。
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?	所以我就很好奇，这种动物有什么故事呢？
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution.	好，在生物学上，没有什么是说得通的， 除非按进化论的角度。
The Mola's no exception.	翻车鱼也不例外。
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs, and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction -- oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.	它们是在恐龙消失之后很短时间内出现的， 6500万年前，那时候鲸类还长着脚， 它们从河豚类群中反叛了出来—— 请允许我在这里套用下吉卜林讲故事的方式。
Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know, about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs -- we're going to head to the high seas.	当然，进化在某种程度上是随机的， 大约5500万年年前，这一支叛变的河豚， 说，噢，珊瑚礁又怎么样？ 我们要到远海去。
And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing, and we turn our puffer into the Mola.	经过无数个世代，不断地调整和扭转， 河豚终于成了翻车鱼的样子。
You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.	要知道，如果给自然母亲足够的时间，她就会创造出这样的东西来。
They look -- maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps, but in fact, in fact they are the -- they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea, right up there with flat fish.	它们看起来，或许它们看起来 有点史前，有点未完待续，或者说有点简略， 但事实上，事实上它们—— 是海洋中进化最彻底的鱼类之一， 更彻底的还有比目鱼。
They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.	它们就是——鱼类变化过程中的每个细节。
And in terms of fishes -- fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern, just 50 million years ago, so -- so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.	说到鱼类， 鱼类出现在5亿年前，而它们出现得相当晚， 大概5千万年前，所以， 有趣的是，它们在发展过程中抛弃了祖先遗传下来的东西。
They start as little eggs, and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.	它们从细小的卵开始， 再次进入吉尼斯世界纪录， 它们是世界上产卵最多的脊椎动物。
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs, can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine -- and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.	一只四英尺长的雌鱼能产3亿颗卵， 想想看，能在卵巢里储存3亿颗卵， 它们能长到10英尺，想象下10英尺的鱼能产多少卵。
And from that little egg, they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry, and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.	从这么小的卵， 它们发育成类似这种六斑刺魨的阶段，让人想起它们的祖先， 再发育，这是它们的青少年阶段，
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.	它们在青少年阶段时聚集成群，但成年时却独来独往。
That's a little diver up there in the corner.	在角落里有个小小的潜水者。
They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.	它们再次登上吉尼斯世界纪录， 这次是作为世界脊椎动物的生长冠军。
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.	从小小的卵，到幼鱼， 再到成年，它们的体重增加了6亿倍！
600 million.	6亿。
Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby, and you had to feed this thing.	想象下如果你有了个小孩， 你喂养他，
That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.	这意味着你的小孩，他会增肥六个泰坦尼克号的重量。
Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but -- we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.	我不知道你会怎么喂养这个小孩， 我们也不知到翻车鱼在野外究竟长得多快， 但对蒙特利湾水族馆中捕获的翻车鱼进行研究， 这是首次捕获到它们的地方之一， 其中一头在14个月里长了800磅。
I said, now, that's a true American.	我说，这是条真正的美国鱼。
So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas, because schooling used to be salvation for fishes, but it's suicide for fishes now.	这些庞然大物都是孤独行者，特别是在现在的海洋里， 过去，聚集成群往往是鱼类躲避掠食的方式， 但现在这却无异于自杀。
But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school, they still get caught in nets as by-catch.	不幸的是，翻车鱼尽管不集群， 它们仍会被作为副渔获物被捕捞上来。
If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination, then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators -- how they live their lives, like the Mola.	如果我们想避免整个世界被水母占据的景象， 我们就必须知道水母的捕食者， 像翻车鱼，是怎么生活的。
And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch -- up to 26 percent of the drift net.	很不幸，在加州漂网的副渔获物中， 翻车鱼占到了26%。
And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries, they make up up to 90 percent.	而在地中海，在旗鱼的捕捞中， 它们占副渔获物的九成。
So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.	因此我们必须搞清楚它们是如何生活。
And how do you do that?	你会怎么做呢？
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.	这种动物只分布在少数几个地方。
This is an open ocean creature.	这是个远洋物种。
It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.	它们生活的环境没有边界，它们不会上陆地。
How do you get insight?	你会如何探寻其中奥秘？
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?	你会如何诱使这样一种大洋生物透露它的秘密？
Well, there's some great new technology that has just recently become available, and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.	一些伟大的新技术， 在最近刚刚出现， 为深入研究大洋的动物提供了便利。
And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.	如图所示。那个小标签。
That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity, which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.	这个小标签能记录温度、深度和光强度， 并与时间相关，从这些数据我们就能确定位置。
And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset.	它最多可以记录长达两年的数据， 将数据保存在标签里，并在预定的时间释放， 浮到海面，将所有的数据和整个的行程记录 传输到卫星，接着中转到我们的电脑上， 我们就可以得到整个的数据资料。
And we didn't even have -- we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.	 我们就只要给动物打上标签，然后回家坐在桌子旁。
So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.	因此研究翻车鱼最重要的一步 就是放标签的时候，看这里， 有东西飘动的那边，那就是我们放标签的位置。
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.	那就像挂在翻车鱼身上的寄生虫一样。
Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.	翻车鱼以携带成吨的寄生虫而闻名。
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.	它们就是寄生虫的酒店，甚至它们的寄生虫也有寄生虫。
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.	我想多恩曾为此写过一首诗。
But they have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.	它们携带有40个属的寄生虫， 我们想，就多一个寄生虫也没什么问题。
And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.	而它们也是携带海洋科学设备的绝好工具，
They don't seem to mind, so far.	至少到目前，它们看起来并不介意。
So what are we trying to find out?	那么我们想发现什么呢？
We're focusing on the Pacific.	我们把焦点放在太平洋。
We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.	我们做标记的地点，从加州海岸，到台湾和日本。
And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents, using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.	我们感兴趣的是这些动物是怎么利用海流， 利用温度和宽阔的海域，进行生活。
We'd love to tag in Monterey.	我们喜欢在蒙特利尔放标签。
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.	蒙特利尔是世界上少数几个有大规模翻车鱼出没的地方之一。
Not this time of year -- it's more around October.	不是这个时候——在十月左右更多。
And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey -- but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.	我们喜欢在这里标记，这是空中俯瞰蒙特利尔的情景。 不幸的是翻车鱼最后的样子是这样。 因为另一位本地居民也喜欢翻车鱼，但方式不同。
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay, rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style, and then tosses them back and forth.	它们一进入湾内，就被加利福尼亚海狮抓住， 它们的鳍被撕掉，被当做大飞盘， 来回地扔来扔去。
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.	我没有夸张，这就是， 有时候它们并不吃翻车鱼，而仅仅是恶作剧。
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior, it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.	你知道，这些本地居民不在乎自己的可怕行为， 一天有一天地看到这种情景实在让人感到恐怖。
The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds, so we head down south, to San Diego.	可怜的小翻车鱼进来就被撕成碎片。 因此我们往南走，到圣迭戈。
Not so many California sea lions down there.	那里没有那么多的加利福尼亚海狮。
And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily, and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.	你可以通过侦察机轻易地找到那里的翻车鱼， 它们喜欢在漂浮的大型褐藻下游荡。
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there.	在这些海藻下——这也是翻车鱼来这里的原因—— 这是翻车鱼的疗养时间。
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.	一旦它们到达海藻下方，吃死皮的清洁鱼就赶来。
And they come and give the Molas -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says, "I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."	它们来给翻车鱼—— 你能看到它们敲打这个有趣的位置，说， 我不是要威胁你，但我需要按摩。
And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head, and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean -- because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.	它们伸出鳍，把眼睛缩回脑袋里， 鱼儿就上来，清洁，清洁，清洁—— 因为翻车鱼，就是个寄生虫自助餐厅。
And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.	再往南走也是不错的地方， 因为水较温暖，那里的翻车鱼也似乎友好一些。
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right, will say, "Okay, scratch me right there."	我是说相比其他种鱼类，如果你靠近的方式正确， 翻车鱼会说，好的，来给我这里抓抓痒。
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle -- and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.	你真的可以游到翻车鱼身边，它们很温和， 如果你靠近得当，你就能给它们抓抓痒，它们会很享受。
So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific; we've gone over to another part of the Pacific, and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.	这样我们就在太平洋的这一部分放了标签， 我们还要去太平洋的另一部分， 我们在台湾做标记，在日本做标记。
And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.	在这些地方，翻车鱼会被沿海的固定渔网捕捞上来。
And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.	它们并没有被当做副渔获物扔回去，而是被吃掉。
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.	有一条翻车鱼在做了标记后不久，就被做成菜招待我们。
Well, not the one we tagged!	呃，不是我们标记的那条！
And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone, to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.	从肾脏，到睾丸，到脊柱， 还有鱼鳍上的肌肉等几乎是鱼身上的所有东西，都可以吃。
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.	所以现在做标记最难的一部分， 就是做完标记之后，你必须等待数个月。
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe, I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording.	然后你就得想，噢，希望那鱼平安无事。 我希望，希望它能够在标签记录的这段时间里 确确实实地在海洋里生活。
The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars, so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.	每个标签耗费3500美元，租用卫星再花500美元， 所以你要，哦，我希望标签也没事。
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.	所以等待的部分才是真正艰难的。
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.	我要给你们看下最近的数据。
And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.	这还没有发表，完全是只提供给TED的私人信息。
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data, we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?	而且在展示的时候，当我们看这些数据， 我们在想，这些动物，它们有没有越过赤道？
Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?	它们是不是从太平洋的这边游到了另一边？
And we found that they kind of are homebodies.	然后我们发现它们其实有点居家男人的感觉。
They're not big migrators.	它们不会大迁徙。
This is their track: we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.	这是它们的路线： 我们在东京附近做了标记，一个月之后， 它们似乎进入了日本附近的黑潮流域，在那里觅食。
And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.	而四个月后，它们到了日本的北部海域。
And that's kind of their home range.	这就是它们的活动范围。
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure, that population doesn't get replenished.	这一点很重要，因为如果那里渔业压力加大， 它们的数量就得不到补充。
So that's a very important piece of data.	因此这是个非常重要的数据。
But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.	另一个重要的事情是它们并非好吃懒做者，
They're super industrious.	它们其实非常勤劳。
And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we -- they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day.	这是翻车鱼一天的生活， 它们游上游下，游上游下，游上游下…… 一天几乎要40次。
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.	太阳升起来的时候，你看这蓝色里，它们开始下沉，
Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.	往下。当阳光变得强烈，它们就沉得更深一点，再深一点。
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade, and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.	它们垂直下降可达600米，那里的温度仅1摄氏度， 这也是为什么会看到它们在海面的原因，那下面太冷了。
They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power, and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.	它们必须上升，寻找温暖，获得太阳能， 然后它们再下降到深处，然后上升，下降，上上下下。
And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer -- which a whole variety of food's in that layer.	而且它们会经过一个称为深海散射层的水层， 那里有各种各样的食物。
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker, they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.	所以跟一些喜欢日光浴的懒汉比起来， 它们可辛勤地多，在海水表层和底层之间 在不同温度之间来回地舞蹈着。
We see the same pattern -- now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas, a real three-dimensional play.	通过这些标记，我们在旗鱼、鲾鲼、金枪鱼等 身上也看到了同样的行为模式， 一个真正三维立体的活动。
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life, where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that.	这是一个更大项目海洋生物大普查中的一部分， 他们的计划是在全世界进行标记， 翻车鱼也将是其中一部分。
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals, and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.	让人兴奋的是，你们都旅行过，你们知道， 在旅行中最棒的事情就是找到当地人， 然后跟他们了解当地知识，找到最好玩的地方。
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.	现在有了海洋生物大普查，我们能够走近所有的土著， 运用当地的知识，探索占我们生物圈90%的地方。
It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.	再没有比这个时候当个生物学家更让人兴奋的事了。
Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.	这也引出我的最后一点，我想到的，也是最有趣的，
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.	我办了个网站，因为我收到了许许多多关于翻车鱼的问题。
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered, and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.	我觉得我必须使这些问题得到解答， 我要感谢我的资助者，如国家地理和林德伯格。
But people would write into the site with all sorts of, all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.	人们会在网站上写下各种各样， 各种各样有关这些动物的故事， 并希望帮助我获取样品进行遗传分析。
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared -- a shared love and an interest in the oceans.	我最感激动地是每个人都有一种 对海洋的大无私的爱和兴趣。
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns, Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in, united by their love of life.	我收到的报告有来自天主教修女的， 有犹太教拉比的，穆斯林的，基督徒的——每个人 都怀着对生命的爱来写。
And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself: "One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."	对我来说，我觉得我说得永远没有那位不朽的诗人说得好： 轻轻一碰大自然，整个世界就亲昵起来
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.	这或许是一种古老的，笨笨的鱼，
If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.	但如果它能使世界团结起来，我想，它就属于未来。
Okay, so 90 percent of my photographic process is, in fact, not photographic.	好的， 事实上，我摄影过程的百分之九十， 不仅仅只是照相。
It involves a campaign of letter writing, research and phone calls to access my subjects, which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia.	它是一个包涵了写信， 研究以及电话联系得以接触拍摄对象 的复杂过程。 我的拍摄对象的范围可以从加沙地区的哈马斯领导人， 到西弗吉尼亚州一只蛰伏于洞穴中的黑熊。 到西弗吉尼亚州一只蛰伏于洞穴中的黑熊。
And oddly, the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World, a seemingly innocuous site.	奇怪的是，我所收到的所有拒信中， 最值得注意的一封， 来自于迪斯尼世界， 一个看起来完全无害的地方。
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence: "Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to."	我只打算读读最关键的一句： 尤其实在现在这样一个恐怖时期， 我个人相信， 在游览我们主题公园的客人们身上带有的神奇魔力， 特别重要， 它为帮助 人们实现逃离现实进入一个想象中的神奇世界 提供了保障。
Photography threatens fantasy.	摄影会威胁想象力。
They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth.	他们不想让我的照相机进入迪斯尼， 因为照相机能挑战了他们所建立的现实、神秘以及信仰， 并提供了真正 事实的证据。
But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.	但每幅照片，都被赋予了不止一个真相， 这取决于拍摄者的目的，以及观看者 以及照片本身所处的环境。
Over a five year period following September 11th, when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders, most notably weapons of mass destruction, I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation, mythology and daily functioning.	在911之后的五年多， 当美国媒体和政府在寻找 美国境外 隐藏的和不为人所知的地点 和著名的大规模杀伤武器， 我选择去探究一些更深层次的东西—— 它们对美国的国家基础、 神话和国家机能来说，是不可或缺的。
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real, and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.	我自愿并真诚地 希望去突破公民的边界， 突破特权和公共介入信息之间的鸿沟， 突破特权和公共介入信息之间的鸿沟，
It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.	这在美国历史乃至世界历史上， 都是重要的时刻—— 人们发现他们无法触及精确的信息。
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph.	我希望我能亲眼看见这一切的核心， 但随我上路的，只是一部相机。
And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.	那只是另一个让我观察的地方， 并让我了解到， 世上没有绝对的、无所不知的知情人。
And the outsider can never really reach the core.	而局外人则永远也无法真正触及事情的核心。
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.	我将展示这一系列中的一些相片。

Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.	每幅图片都配有一段非常详尽的、确凿的文字说明。
And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image, and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image.	而我最感兴趣的是， 存在于文字和对应图片之间的 隐形的距离， 以及照片如何被转述为文字， 文字又如何由照片阐释。
So, at best, the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.	所以，最理想的情况，照片也注定要转变为 抽象的概念、真相和想象。
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground.	而文字则如同锐利的锚 将这些漂浮的东西牢牢地按在地上。

He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.	他是被一名11岁的证人错误指认的。
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.	卓伊韦伯在弗吉尼亚的犯罪现场被拍摄了这张照片。
He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery, and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.	他被判有强奸、绑架和抢劫罪， 在监狱里度过了47年刑罚中的7年。
Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward, but said he looked too old.	卓伊是在一系列照片中被证人指认的， 证人对这个指认并不十分确定， 认为卓伊看起来太老了一点。
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier, which they entered into a photo array days later, and he was positively identified.	于是警察就去找了一张卓伊 四年前的照片， 几天后把它放进照片系列里， 于是卓伊就被指认了。
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.	现在，我要最后展示一个我的自拍照。
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant, and our eyes are easily deceived.	它继续说明了相片的失真是经常发生的， 而我们的眼睛非常容易受到欺骗。
That's it. Thank you.	谢谢大家。
At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we're going to become, and then when we become those people, we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.	在我们生命的每个阶段， 我们都会做出一些决定， 这些决定会深刻影响 未来我们自己的生活， 当我们成为未来的自己时， 我们并不总是对过去 做过的决定感到高兴。
So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get.	所以年轻人花很多钱 洗去当还是青少年时 花了很多钱做上的纹身。
Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry.	中年人急着跟 年轻时迫不及待想结婚的人离婚。
Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.	老年人很努力的挥霍着 作为中年人时不停工作所赚的钱。
On and on and on.	如此没完没了。
The question is, as a psychologist, that fascinates me is, why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret?	作为一个心理学家， 让我感兴趣的问题是， 为什么我们会做出 让自己将来常常后悔的决定？
Now, I think one of the reasons -- I'll try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time.	我认为其中一个原因—— 而我今天想说服你们的——， 就是我们对时间的力量 有个基本的错误概念。
Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan, that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year.	你们每个人都知道变化的速度 随着人的年龄增长不断放慢， 孩子们好像每分钟都有变化， 而父母们的变化则要慢得多。
But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl?	那么生命中这个让变化 突然间从飞速变得缓慢的 神奇转折点应该叫什么呢？
Is it teenage years?	是青少年时期吗？
Is it middle age?	是中年时期吗？
Is it old age?	是老年阶段吗？
The answer, it turns out, for most people, is now, wherever now happens to be.	 其实对大多数人来说， 答案是，现在， 无论现在发生在什么。
What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion, an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives.	今天我想让大家明白的是， 我们所有人都在围绕着 一种错觉生活， 这种错觉就是，我们每个人的过去， 都已经结束了， 我们已经成为了 我们应该成为的那种人， 在余下的生命中也都会如此。
Let me give you some data to back up that claim.	我想给你们展示一些数据 来支持这个观点。
So here's a study of change in people's personal values over time.	这是一项关于人们的个人价值观 随时间变化的研究。
Here's three values.	这里有3种价值观。
Everybody here holds all of them, but you probably know that as you grow, as you age, the balance of these values shifts.	每个人的生活都与这三个价值观相关， 但是你们可能知道， 随着你们慢慢长大， 变老，这三个价值观的平衡点 会不断变化。
So how does it do so?	到底是怎么回事呢？
Well, we asked thousands of people.	我们询问了数千人。
We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years, and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years.	我们让他们当中一半的人预测了一下 在未来10年中， 他们的价值观会发生多大的改变， 让另一半人告诉我们 在过去的10年中， 他们的价值观发生了多大的变化。
And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis, because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people, say, 18 years old, to the reports of people who were 28, and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan.	这项调查可以让我们做一个很有趣的分析， 因为它可以让我们将 大约18岁左右的人的预测同 大约28岁左右的人的答案相比较， 这项分析可以贯穿人的一生。
Here's what we found.	这是我们的发现。
First of all, you are right, change does slow down as we age, but second, you're wrong, because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.	首先，你们是对的， 随着我们年龄的增长，变化会减缓。 第二，你们错了， 因为这种变化并不像我们想象的那么慢。
At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set, people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years.	在我们的数据库从18岁到68岁的 每一个年龄段中， 人们大大的低估了在未来的10年 他们会经历多少变化。
We call this the "end of history" illusion.	我们把这叫做历史终止错觉。
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect, you can connect these two lines, and what you see here is that 18-year-olds anticipate changing only as much as 50-year-olds actually do.	为了让你们了解这种影响有多大， 你们可以把这两条线连接起来， 你们现在看到的是18岁的人群 预期的改变仅仅和 50岁的人群实际经历的一样。
Now it's not just values.	现在不仅仅是价值观了。
It's all sorts of other things.	 其他的方面都也有变化。
For example, personality.	比如说，人格。
Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality: neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.	你们当中的很多人知道现在心理学家们认为 人格可以分为五个基本维度： 神经质性，经验汲取度， 协调性，外向性和道德感。
Again, we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years, and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years, and what we found, well, you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over, because once again the rate of change does slow as we age, but at every age, people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade.	回到原来的话题， 我们问人们他们期待未来的10年中 自己会有多大的变化， 以及他们在过去的10年中发生了多少变化， 我们发现了， 你们会习惯不断地看到这个图表， 因为又一次，变化速率随着我们的年龄增长 减慢了。 但是在每一个年龄阶段，人们都低估了 在未来的十年中 他们的人格会发生多大的改变。
And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality.	而且不光是像价值观和人格这样的 临时性的特质。
You can ask people about their likes and dislikes, their basic preferences.	你们可以问问人们关于他们喜好和厌恶的事， 他们基本的偏好。
For example, name your best friend, your favorite kind of vacation, what's your favorite hobby, what's your favorite kind of music.	比如说，说出你最好朋友的名字， 你最喜欢什么样的假期， 你最大的爱好是什么， 你最喜欢什么样的音乐。
People can name these things.	人们可以说出这些事情。
We ask half of them to tell us, "Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years?"	我们让他们当中的一半人告诉我们， 你认为这在未来10年内会改变吗？
and half of them to tell us, "Did that change over the last 10 years?"	让另一半告诉我们， 这个在过去十年内变化了吗？
And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now, and here it is again: people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in 10 years, the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in 10 years, and yet, people who are 10 years older all say, "Eh, you know, that's really changed."	我们的发现是， 嗯，这个图你们已经看过2次了， 再展示一次： 人们推测他们现在的朋友 在未来10年中还会是他们的朋友， 他们喜欢的度假之地在未来10年内 还会是他们喜欢的地方， 然而，年长10岁的人都会说： 嗯，你知道，这确实不一样了。
Does any of this matter?	这有什么关系吗？
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn't have consequences?	这只是一种 并不会有什么后果的错误的预测吗？
No, it matters quite a bit, and I'll give you an example of why.	不，这有很大的关系， 我会举例告诉你们为什么。
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways.	它在很多重要的方面困扰着我们做决定。
Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician 10 years ago.	现在想想你们此时此刻 最喜欢的音乐人， 还有10年前你们最喜欢的音乐人。
I put mine up on the screen to help you along.	我把我的答案放在大屏幕上作为提示。
Now we asked people to predict for us, to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert 10 years from now, and on average, people said they would pay 129 dollars for that ticket.	现在我们让人们 预测一下，告诉我们 他们现在愿意付多少钱 来参加他们现在最喜欢的音乐人 从现在起10年后的音乐会， 平均来讲，人们会说他们会付 129美元买票。
And yet, when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite 10 years ago perform today, they say only 80 dollars.	然而，当我们问他们 愿意付多少钱去看 他们10年前喜欢的人现在的演出， 他们说只有80块。
Now, in a perfectly rational world, these should be the same number, but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability.	那么，在一个完全理性的世界里， 这两个数字应该是相同的， 但是我们为沉浸于当前喜好中 的机会付了更多的钱， 因为我们高估了它们的持久性。
Why does this happen?	为什么会发生这样的变化呢？
We're not entirely sure, but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining.	 我们也不是很确定， 不过这可能与 记忆的消逝和 想象的难度相关。
Most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago, but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be, and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine, it's not likely to happen.	我们中的大多数人都能记得 10年前的我们是什么样子， 但是要想像我们会成为什么样的人就困难了， 然后我们会错误地认为因为很难想象， 就不太可能会发生。
Sorry, when people say "I can't imagine that," they're usually talking about their own lack of imagination, and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they're describing.	很遗憾，当人们说我可想象不出来， 他们通常是在表达他们缺乏想象力， 而不是他们所描述的 不可能发生的事情。
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.	总而言之，时间是一种强大的力量。
It transforms our preferences.	它改变了我们的喜好。
It reshapes our values.	它重塑了我们的价值观。
It alters our personalities.	它改变了我们的人格。
We seem to appreciate this fact, but only in retrospect.	我们似乎会感激这个事实， 但是只在回想过去的时候。
Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade.	只有在我们回首过去的时候我们才会认识到 在过去的十年里发生了多么大的变化。
It's as if, for most of us, the present is a magic time.	好像，对我们大多数人来说， 当前是个有魔力的时刻。
It's a watershed on the timeline.	它是时间轴上的分水岭。
It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves.	它是一个使我们最终成为 我们自己的时刻。
Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished.	人类还处在发展变化的过程中， 却错误地以为他们不会发生任何改变了。
The person you are right now is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been.	现在的你 只是处于过渡中，转瞬即逝， 暂时的的状态而已， 就像所有那些过去的你。
The one constant in our life is change.	在我们的生命中唯一不变的就是， 变化。
Thank you.	谢谢大家。
Think about your day for a second.	花点时间回想你的一天
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door, encountered new colleagues and had great discussions, and felt in awe when you found something new.	你清晨醒来，走出房门的时候感受到清风拂过你的脸颊 巧遇新的同事，与其谈天说地 当你发现新事物时则心怀敬畏
But I bet there's something you didn't think about today -- something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all.	但我确定今天会有些你没有想到的事情-- 一些如此贴近生活的 但你可能完全忽略的事情。
And that's that all the sensations, feelings, decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain.	其中包含的所有的感知能力，感情 决策和行动 都直接受控于在你头部的电脑 叫做大脑的部分。
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous -- but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain, and to see the intricacy of what lies within.	大脑看可不像外表看起来那样-- 只是几磅桃灰色的肉块， 非结晶的固体-- 但是经过上百年积淀的神经学 让我们能进一步的研究大脑， 并了解大脑的错综复杂。
And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.	研究告诉我们大脑 是由上千亿个神经元细胞 组成的难以想象的复杂电路
Now unlike a human-designed computer, where there's a fairly small number of different parts -- we know how they work, because we humans designed them -- the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells, maybe tens of thousands.	不同于人类设计的电脑 那种由较少的不同元件组成的-- 我们了解它们如何工作，因为是我们人类设计出了它们-- 大脑由上千种不同的细胞组成 也许是上万种
They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules.	它们分化成不同的形状；它们分泌出不同分子；
And they project and connect to different brain regions, and they also change different ways in different disease states.	它们延伸并连接大脑的不同地区。
There's a class of cells, a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.	有一种细胞， 一种较小的，抑制性细胞，能够抑制周围细胞。
It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.	这是一种其萎缩能导致类似神经分裂症状的细胞
It's called the basket cell.	这叫做篮细胞
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about.	它是我们正在研究的成千上万种细胞 中的一种
New ones are being discovered everyday.	每天都会有发现新型的细胞。
As just a second example: these pyramidal cells, large cells, they can span a significant fraction of the brain.	第二个例子： 这些锥体细胞，大型的细胞 他们分布在大脑的很多部位
They're excitatory.	它们易受刺激。
And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy.	其中的一部分细胞 可能会因过度的活动而导致疾病类似癫症。
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device.	这些细胞中每一个 都是一个神奇的电子元件
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs, which then, if they pass a certain threshold, will go to thousands of downstream partners.	它们从上游细胞接收信息 然后编辑出它们自己的输出信息， 然后，如果这些信息通过了特定的界限， 就会传递到下游上千个细胞那里。
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so, happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells, as long as you live and think and feel.	这个仅仅会花费一毫秒左右的时间的过程 在你身上的每个1万亿个细胞中 每分钟发生上千次， 只要你活着 思考着感受着。
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?	我们将如何解释这些回路的运作呢？
Ideally, we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.	主观上，我们能刺激这些回路 把不同种细胞反复刺激 看我们是否能了解 哪种细胞作用于特定的功用 哪种细胞出错会引起特定的病理
If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash, what they can initiate and sustain.	如果我们能激活细胞，我们就能了解它们能释放哪种能量 他们是如何启动和维持的.
If we could turn them off, then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for.	如果我们能把它们全部切断 我们就可能弄清楚它们的必要性。
And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today.	这就是今天我要告诉大家的故事。
And honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years, through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off, both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans.	老实说， 我们试图寻找方法 来控制大脑中的回路，细胞，部分的组织还有 它的传输途径 这不仅是对科学的探索， 也是直面人类所面临的 一些问题。
Now before I tell you about the technology, the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room, if we live long enough, will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.	在我告诉大家这项技术之前 坏消息是我们之间的绝大数人 如果你们活的够久远的话 将会面临，也许，脑部疾病
Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them, and the numbers don't do it justice though.	如今，10亿人 已经患有某些脑部疾病 阻碍它们生活 虽然这数字无法准确的表现出其严重性
These disorders -- schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, depression, addiction -- they not only steal our time to live, they change who we are.	这些疾病--精神分裂症，老年痴呆症 抑郁症，成瘾症-- 它们不仅榨取我们的生命，而且篡改我们生存的意义
They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people.	它剥夺了我们的性格也改变了我们的情感-- 更改变了我们做人的本质
Now in the 20th century, there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders, and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders, practically none of them can be considered to be cured.	如今在20世纪， 通过治疗脑部疾病的 制药业的发展浮现出的一些希望 同时很多药物被研发出 能减缓脑部疾病的症状 实际上没有那种病被认为是能被治愈的
And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical.	其中一部分是因为，我们大脑浸泡在化学物质当中
This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance.	这复杂的回路 由上千种不同类型的细胞组成 正浸泡在液体当中
That's also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too.	这也是为什么，市面上大部分的药物，不全都 会引起某些严重的副作用。
Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.	如今有些人通过在大脑植入电击器 来改善某些疾病。
And for Parkinson's disease, Cochlear implants, these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder.	对于帕金森症 耳蜗移植电击器 的确能够 带给患有一些特殊疾病的患者 一些治疗效果
But electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance, which is where that phrase, in part, comes from.	但是电流还是会往四散开去-- 找软柿子捏 这也是这句谚语的，部分的，出处
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix.	电流不仅作用在我们需要修复的细胞还会影响到那些正常的回路
So again, we're sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control.	再一次，我们绕回到了 超精确控制的问题上
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go?	我们是否能把信息精确的传输到我们想要地方？
So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago, I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist, and the first thing I thought about was, if these neurons are electrical devices, all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance.	当11年前我开始研究神经科学 我受训成为一个电学工程师和物理学家 而且第一件我想到的事 如果这些神经元是电子元件 所有我们要做的是找到某些方法 在一定距离控制电流的变化
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell, but not its neighbors, that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells, figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded.	如果我们能刺激单独一个细胞 而不牵涉它周边 那就我们就有了能激活和关闭各种不同细胞的工具 了解它们的作用和他们如何作用 在它们位于的脑部网络
And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry.	同样这给了我们需要的超精确控制 来修复出错 的回路
Now how are we going to do that?	如今我们将怎么做呢？
Well there are many molecules that exist in nature, which are able to convert light into electricity.	自然中有很多分子 能够把光转化为电流
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells.	你可以把它们看做小蛋白质 像太阳能细胞
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow, then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.	如果我们能用某种方法把这些分子注入到神经元中 这些神经元就能转型成光控的电子元件
And their neighbors, which don't have the molecule, would not.	那些周边的细胞，那些没有接受分子的，就不会转型
There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen, and that's the ability to get light into the brain.	另外还有一个你需要知道的小窍门， 就是把光注入脑中。
And to do that -- the brain doesn't feel pain -- you can put -- taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on -- optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate, in animal models for example, in pre-clinical studies, these neurons and to see what they do.	这么做--大脑不会感知到痛苦--你能-- 充分利用脑中 类似互联网和沟通的功能-- 把光纤连接到激光束中 以此来激活，比如说动物的细胞 在潜伏期的研究中 要了解这些神经元的功用
So how do we do this?	那我们应该怎么做呢？
Around 2004, in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth, this vision came to fruition.	大概在2004年 在与格哈德·内格尔和卡尔·戴斯洛合作的时候 假想得到了最终的成功
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild, and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally.	自然界中有一种特定的海藻 它就有趋光性 来达到最理想的光合效果
And it senses light with a little eye-spot, which works not unlike how our eye works.	它用一个小眼点来感知光线 但其工作原理和人眼大相径庭
In its membrane, or its boundary, it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity.	在它的细胞膜，或者它的边界 含有少量的蛋白质 能把光转化为电流
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.	这些分子被叫做槽型视紫质
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.	这种蛋白质就像我告诉过你们的太阳能细胞那样运作
When blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot, and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery.	当蓝光照射时，它会打开一个小口 允许带点的微粒进入眼点中 这样眼点就有了电信号 就像是用太阳能细胞给电池充电一般
So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons.	我们需要做的就是提取这些分子 然后用某种方法注入到神经元中
And because it's a protein, it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.	同时因为这是蛋白质 由生物的DNA编码而成
So all we've got to do is take that DNA, put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus, and put it into neurons.	所以我们所要做的就是提取DNA 注入到基因载体上，比如病毒 然后把病毒注入到神经元中
So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy, and lots of viruses were coming along.	结果证明基因载体是一个很直接的方法 病毒长驱直入
So this turned out to be very simple to do.	证实了操作的简易性
And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004, we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.	在2004年夏天的一个早晨 我们实物操作了一番，第一次尝试有了起效
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron.	你提取出DNA并注入到神经元中
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell, like putting solar panels on a roof, and the next thing you know, you have a neuron which can be activated with light.	神经元用它自身的蛋白质合成器 来组装出这些小型的光敏蛋白质 并使其分不到细胞各处 就像在顶层架设太阳能板 接下去 你就有了个光敏的神经元
So this is very powerful.	这是个很有效的工具
One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors.	你要做的步骤 就是设法把这些基因注入到你需要的细胞内 而不是其他周边的细胞
And you can do that; you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others.	你可以完成；你能转变这些病毒 让它们只针对一些细胞而涉及到其他细胞
And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells.	还有其他基因方式能 得到这种光敏细胞
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics.	如今这领域叫做光遗传学
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do, you can take a complex network, use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network.	举个例子来说明你要做的， 你可以在一个复杂的网络系统 利用一种病毒来传递这种基因 在密集的细胞区域只针对一种细胞
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated.	接着当你照射整个区域的时候 只有那些特定的细胞被激活
So for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier -- the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory.	比如说，用篮细胞来做例子会更简单一点 就是那种萎缩导致精神分裂 有抑制作用的细胞
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -- and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course -- and then flash blue light over the entire brain network, just these cells are going to be driven.	如果我们能把基因注入到这些细胞中-- 而且他们不会引起基因的表现型有所改变-- 接着用蓝光照射整个脑组织 只有蓝细胞会被激活
And when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal, so they don't seem to be averse against that.	而当无光线的时候，这些细胞就变回普通的细胞 没有产生不良的后果
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do, what their power is in computing in the brain, but you can also use this to try to figure out -- well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells, if indeed they're atrophied.	不仅你能了解到这些细胞的功用 在大脑运作中它们的能效 而且你也能尝试解决-- 也许我们可以激活这些细胞的活性， 如果它们真的萎缩的话。
Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we're using this, both at the scientific, clinical and pre-clinical levels.	现在我想告诉你一些小故事 关于我们怎么利用这技术的, 在科学，临床阶段和临床前阶段的研究。
One of the questions we've confronted is, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward?	在我们遭遇到的问题中有一个 是，大脑用什么样的信号来代表奖励的感觉呢？
Because if you could find those, those would be some of the signals that could drive learning.	因为如果我们找到的话 那能够驱使细胞学习的信号
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward.	大脑就会为了奖励竭尽全力
And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.	同时也是这些出错的信号引起疾病类似成瘾症
So if we could figure out what cells they are, we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against, or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability.	如果我们能够知道是哪些细胞的话 我们可能就有新的靶细胞 来专门设计或者挑选药物来对抗疾病 或者找到植入电击器的位置 来帮助那些有着严重残疾的病人
So to do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group, where one side of this little box, if the animal goes there, the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.	为了做到这些，我们想出了一个简单的例子 在菲奥雷拉集团的协助下 在盒子的一边 如果动物经过这里，就会被光波照射到 来区别不同细胞对光的感应能力.
So if these cells can mediate reward, the animal should go there more and more.	那如果这些细胞是识别为被奖励的 那动物就会多次的经过那里
And so that's what happens.	这就是大致的经过
This animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there, and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.	动物会向右转并用鼻子顶那块地方 每次它做这个动作就会有一道蓝光照射
And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times.	那它就会为此重复千上百次
These are the dopamine neurons, which some of you may have heard about, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.	这些是多巴胺神经元 你们中的一些可能可能听说过它在大脑的快感中枢某处
Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough, indeed, to drive learning.	现在我们所展示的简短的步骤 就足够，确定的，来诱导学习行为
Now we can generalize the idea.	如今我们概括出大致的观点
Instead of one point in the brain, we can devise devices that span the brain, that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns -- arrays of optical fibers, each coupled to its own independent miniature light source.	不是大脑中的某一点 我们可以发明一些能够桥接大脑的设备 来把光照射成三维的模式-- 利用光纤的巧妙排列 每个光纤都有自身独立的微型光源.
And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to-date in a dish -- like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen.	接着我们在生物体上试验 测试那些已经在培养皿中完成的实验-- 就像是给整个大脑做了高速的扫描一般 来确定特定的信号会触发哪些特定的事情
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders.	或者它们会成为临床上很好的 治疗脑部疾病的新目标
And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.	另外一件我想说的事是 我们如何寻找靶细胞来治疗创伤后应激障碍-- 这是一种不受控制的焦虑恐慌的症候群
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear.	我们要做的一件事 接受一个经典的恐怖模式
This goes back to the Pavlovian days.	那就回到了巴甫洛夫的时代
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning -- where a tone ends with a brief shock.	也被称作巴甫洛夫恐惧条件反射 在响声后的短暂电击
The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.	电极并不疼痛，但是有点烦人
And over time -- in this case, a mouse, which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone.	久而久之--这里的例子，老鼠 是一个很好的动物典型，在试验中广泛使用-- 动物学会去害怕响声
The animal will react by freezing, sort of like a deer in the headlights.	会表现出呆滞的反应 有点像鹿被车灯照射后的反应一样
Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear?	如今的问题是，大脑中哪些目标位置 能让我们克服这种恐惧？
So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear.	我们所做的就是再一次播放那 当已经和恐惧联系起来的响声
But we activate targets in the brain, different ones, using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide, in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.	但是我们激活大脑中的靶细胞，每次不同的位置 利用光纤阵列来演示出之前那样的图片 来尝试找出能让大脑克服 恐惧记忆的靶细胞
And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now.	这简短的录像 展示给大家一些我们正在研究的几个靶细胞
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex, a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states.	这是前额皮层的一部分 一块能让我们用感知来尝试克服厌恶情绪的区域
And the animal's going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there.	动物将听到同样的响声--以及一束光线
There's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing.	光线不伴随声音，但是你也能看到动物呆滞的反应
This tone used to mean bad news.	这声响意味着坏的消息
And there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner, so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.	在左下角有个小型的闹钟 你能看到老鼠用了大约两分钟僵立在那里
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later.	下一个片段 是八分钟之后
And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.	同样的响声，和相同的光线再一次的出现
Okay, there it goes. Right now.	好，开始了，就现在
And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment, that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory.	正如你所见，只用了10分钟的实验 我们就用光激活了大脑的这部分区域 来克服恐惧记忆 的表现行为
Now over the last couple of years, we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.	近几年里，我们正回溯本源 因为我们想找到控制大脑的方法
If we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.	如果我们能够控制的话，那就可能是极具影响的
If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds, you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded.	如果让细胞失效就算几毫秒或者几秒的话 就能了解到它们所在位置的脑电路 所扮演的本质的角色
And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.	如今我们已经调查了生物界所有的生物-- 所有生物除了动物，我们并没有发现太大的差异。
And we found all sorts of molecules, they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins, that respond to green and yellow light.	我们发现了各种各样的分子，被命名为感光紫红蛋白或者远古感光蛋白 会对绿色和黄色光线作出反应
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin.	它们的反应是与之前我所提到的蓝光 活性槽型视紫质的反应恰恰相反
Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go.	举个例子来说明具体的情况
Consider, for example, a condition like epilepsy, where the brain is overactive.	比如说癫痫这个症状 起因是大脑过度活跃
Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment, one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.	如果癫痫药物治疗失败 其他一种方法就是移除那部分大脑
But that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects.	但是这显然是不可逆的过程，而且会引起副作用
What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time, until the seizure dies away, and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state -- sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state.	那如果我们让那部分大脑休眠一会儿 知道症状全部消失 再让大脑恢复到原来的阶段-- 就好像把一个活跃的系统诱骗到一个稳定的系统一样
So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light, and we beam light in, and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure, we're hoping to be able to turn it off.	这动画只是为了解释 我们能利用光源来控制脑细胞这个概念 当我们用光照射时 照射的时间也仅仅是能够刚好让症状消除 我们希望实验能够成功
And so we don't have data to show you on this front, but we're very excited about this.	暂时我们还没有这方面的实验数据展示给大家 但是我们对此充满期待
Now I want to close on one story, which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control, can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic.	现在我想用一个故事来结束我的演讲 我们认为此技术能有其他用途--- 如果能超精确控制这些感光蛋白 能够在脑中 形成一个新型的假肢，光学的价值
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.	我曾说过，电击器并不普遍
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted.	如今只有75000位帕金森病人植入了脑部电击器
Maybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants, which allow them to hear.	大约10万人在耳蜗中植入电击器 通过这样来恢复他们的听觉
There's another thing, which is you've got to get these genes into cells.	另一件事，就是你要让这些基因细胞移植入细胞中
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus, which probably most of us around this room have, and it doesn't have any symptoms, which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body.	基因治疗的新希望也就此诞生了 因为像腺类病毒这类病毒 可能我们大多数都有携带 但它不会引发任何症状 它已经在上百名病人体内应用治疗 来转送基因进入大脑或者身体内
And so far, there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus.	目前为止，还有没有因为此病毒 而引起任何严重不良反应的报告
There's one last elephant in the room, the proteins themselves, which come from algae and bacteria and fungi, and all over the tree of life.	还有最后一点要重视的大隐患，就是蛋白质其本身 那些来自于藻类，细菌以及真菌 以及来自生物界的各种蛋白质
Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains, so what is our brain going to do if we put that in?	我们大多数脑子没有真菌或者藻类的存在 那如果我们把它们放入脑中会怎么样呢？
Are the cells going to tolerate it?	我们大脑是否会排斥它？
Will the immune system react?	免疫系统是否会反应？
In its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet -- but we're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this, and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light.	早期的时候--我们并没有在人体里做实验-- 但是我们做了其他各种研究 来评估这方法 目前为止，我们还没有因这些分子或者 因光照大脑 而产生的严重不良反应
So it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it.	这还是初步的研究，就算如此，我们很激动
I wanted to close with one story, which we think could potentially be a clinical application.	我想用一个故事来结束我的演讲 我们认为这有可能 成为一种临床的疗法
Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors, our light sensors that are in the back of our eye, are gone.	失明有很多种类 大多关于 我们的眼球内部的光受体的损害。
And the retina, of course, is a complex structure.	我们的视网膜是个很复杂的结构
Now let's zoom in on it here, so we can see it in more detail.	我们来放大，仔细研究一下
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top, and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells, relay the information to the brain, where we see that as perception.	照片中的感光受体在顶部 被感光受体接收到的光信号 经过各种转化 最终从上而下，从神经节细胞 传输信息到大脑出 以此来获得视觉
In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa, or macular degeneration, the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.	很多种类的失明，比如色素性视网膜炎 或者黄斑部变性 感光细胞是萎缩或者有损伤的
Now how could you repair this?	那我们如何才能修复呢？
It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored, because there's nothing for the drug to bind to.	还没有证据证明药物可以对治疗这些疾病 因为还没有针对的特效药
On the other hand, light can still get into the eye.	但是，光还是能进入眼球的
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in.	眼球还是通透的，你也能看到光线能够进入
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras.	所以，如果我们能把这些单细胞感光紫红质蛋白和其他分子 注入到那些正常的细胞中 把它们转化为一台台小的摄像机
And because there's so many of these cells in the eye, potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras.	因为眼球内部有很多细胞 有可能，他们会成为高清的相机
So this is some work that we're doing.	这就是我们所在做的
It's being led by one of our collaborators, Alan Horsager at USC, and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience, which is funded by the NIH.	我们合作人之一 艾伦·霍斯葛 也正在美国卫生研究所的资助下将其技术 商业化运作
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.	现在你所看到的是一个走迷宫的老鼠
It's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there.	这是六臂的迷宫，迷宫中有些许水 来刺激老鼠移动，否则它只会呆在某处
And the goal, of course, of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port.	当然，这迷宫的目的 是为了让水流入一个 顶光源的平台
Now mice are smart, so this mouse solves the maze eventually, but he does a brute-force search.	老鼠很聪明，最终走出了这迷宫 但是这是靠蛮力解决的
He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.	它游过了每条分支最终才找到了平台
So he's not using vision to do it.	所以它没有利用视觉来解决这问题
These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.	这些老鼠有着不一样的突变基因 各自代表着人类不用种类的失明症状
And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach.	所以我们有很小心的探索不同种类的失明情况下 找出一个普遍的解决方法
So how are we going to solve this?	那我们如何解决呢？
We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.	我们就完全按照之前片子里讲的那样
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive.	把蓝光感光蛋白 注入到眼球最后方的视网膜的 一层细胞上 把它们转化为一台台相机 就好像这些神经元上布满了太阳能细胞一样 让它们接受光信号
Light is converted to electricity on them.	并把光信号转化为电信号
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus.	这老鼠实验前几周就瞎了 只接受过一次携带有感光受体分子的病毒注射
And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again.	你现在可以看到，老鼠能够避开墙壁 找到有亮光的平台 视觉得到了恢复
And to point out the power of this: these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.	为了指出其中的意义： 这些动物走到平台的时间 和那些没有瞎的东西用时是一样的
So this pre-clinical study, I think, bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future.	虽然还处于临床前阶段 但是我认为这是个好兆头 未来我们希望我们能够成功
To close, I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology.	最后，我想指出我们正研究的一种 针对神经科学这新领域的商业模式
We're developing these tools, but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world, so people can study and try to treat different disorders.	我们发明了这些工具 但是我们愿意和全世界的人共同分享 这样人们才能进一步研究并尝试治疗其他各种疾病
And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them, we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier, practically none of which are cured, and in the 21st century make them history.	我们希望，通过了解大脑的神经网络 通过某种程度的手术，能让我们修复并设计神经网络 我们会继续研究我之前讲过的几种疾病 特别是那几种从未被治愈过的 他们在21世纪将会成为历史
Thank you.	谢谢
Juan Enriquez: So some of the stuff is a little dense.	Juan Enriquez：您的演讲有些深奥啊。
But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs, and being able to target those specifically is a first step.	但是利用光 来控制癫痫或者抽搐 而不是用药物 还要能够精确地控制靶细胞 是第一步。
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors, like an on/off switch.	据我所听到的，第二步 是用两种色彩的光来控制大脑 就好像开关一样
Ed Boyden: That's right.	艾德·博伊登:没错.
JE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code.	JE：这让每个大脑中的神经冲动变成二进制的代码
Right, yeah.	EB：是的
So with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.	当蓝灯亮起时，我们能传输信息。就类似于代码1
And by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.	等光关闭了，就类似代码0
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities.	我们的希望是最终建造一个大脑协同处理器 来和大脑一起运作 以此来帮助那些有残疾的人
JE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them?	JE：这是不是意味着某天你能下载记忆 或者上传记忆呢？
Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard.	EB：我们着手的某些工作是很复杂的
We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too.	我们还在继续的研究 我们也在尝试去标记下这个大脑记录数据
So we can record information and then drive information back in -- sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing.	我们就能记录信息，并把信息传输回大脑-- 类似于了解什么是大脑所需的 来增强它的信息处理效率.
JE: Well, that might change a couple things.	JE: 嗯，这会改变我的世界的。
Thank you.	谢谢!
I started with paragliding.	我是从高崖跳伞开始我的特技生涯的。
Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider, with the possibility to fly cross-country, distance, just with the use of thermals to soar.	高崖跳伞就是利用滑翔降落伞从高山上 跳下，高崖跳伞可以让你 穿越乡间，并且飞得更远， 而且仅仅利用热空气来让你飞行。
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider.	滑翔降落伞可以在空中提供 更多的机动性。
From there I started with skydiving.	自那以后我开始从事高空跳伞。
In this picture you can see there is a four-way skydive, four people flying together, and on the left hand side it's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump, for the film itself and also for the judging.	从这张照片你可以看到 这个是四人式跳伞， 四个人一块儿下落， 左手边的跳伞员负责摄像机 他的头盔上设有一个摄像机 所以他就可以拍摄整个跳伞过程， 拍摄的目的不仅仅是为了拍摄还为了事后对录像进行分析。
From regular, relative skydiving I went on to freeflying.	从一般的特技跳伞开始，我逐渐 开始转向自由式跳伞。
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.	自由式跳伞更加强调了对三维空间的运用。
You can see the skydiver with the red suit, he's in a stand-up position.	你可以看见穿红色跳伞服的跳伞员， 他的下落姿势是站立式的。
The one with the yellow-green suit, he's flying head-down.	穿黄绿相间跳伞服的， 是倒立式下落的。
And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation in freefall also, with the helmet cam to film this jump.	背后的那个人是我，围绕着中间两个人转 同样是自由落体，也同样戴了一个头盔摄像机 在拍摄这次跳伞。
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.	从自由式跳伞我又开始空中滑板，
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.	空中滑板就是高空跳伞的同时在脚上加一块滑板。
You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board, there is a lot of force, a lot of power.	显而易见，因为滑板巨大的 接触面积， 可以在下落过程中提供很大的上升力。
Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves."	当然我可以利用这种力 做出各种动作 －我们管这个动作叫直升机式。
From there I went on to wingsuit flying.	然后我又开始翼服飞行。
Wingsuit flying is a suit, that I can make fly, just only with my body.	翼服飞行是利用翼服， 实现仅仅利用身体就可以飞行。
If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit, I can make it fly.	假如我用我的身体给翼服增大张力， 我就可以飞行了。
And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface.	显而易见， 翼服飞行的下坠速度要明显得慢 就是因为翼服增大了与空气得接触面积。
With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance.	假如动作标准我就可以往前飞行 得很远。
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.	这是我在里约热内卢的一跳。
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.	你可以看到我的左手边是科巴卡巴纳海滩。
From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.	从那以后我利用了从高崖跳伞到现在 学到的所有知识和技巧以及不同的飞行规则， 我开始了低空跳伞。
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects, like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth -- meaning mountains, cliffs.	低空跳伞那是从固定的物体上跳伞， 比如说，房屋，天线，桥和大地 － 所谓大地就是高山和悬崖。
It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall, with all the visual references.	对我来说这绝对是 在自由落体的同时 又能利用周边环境做参照物的最好的感觉了。
So my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before.	所以我的目标是尽快找到 从来没有人跳过的地方。
So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump the Eiger North Face in Switzerland.	2000年的夏天我是第一个 从瑞士Eiger山北面低空跳伞的人。
Two years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn, a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here.	两年后，我是第一个从Matterhorn跳下的人， Matterhorn是一个大概 在座每位都知道的山。
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau, three very famous mountains in Switzerland.	2005年我从Eiger, Monk 和 Jungfrau 三座在瑞士非常有名的山跳下。
The special thing on these three jumps were, I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.	从这三处跳下的特别之处在于， 我仅花一天就爬上了那些山。
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.	2008年我从巴黎埃菲尔铁塔上跳下。
So with all this knowledge, I also wanted to get into stunts.	（众笑） 随着我知识的增长，我又 想从事特技表演。
So with some friends we started to do different tricks, like for example this jump here, I jumped from a paraglider.	我和几个朋友一起开始做各种各样的特技， 比如说从这里跳下， 我从一个滑翔伞上跳下。
Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me, because it was very cold in Austria where we did this filming.	或者说从这里，每个人都冻得不行了，除了我， 因为我们的拍摄地， 奥地利很冷。
Everybody sitting in a basket, and I was on top of the balloon, ready to slide down with my skysurf board.	所有人都待在热气球的架子里， 我则在热气球的顶端， 准备从顶端用高空滑板上滑下。
Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.	还有这一跳，从高速公路上行驶的货车上跳下。
Extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step, if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge.	（众笑） 像这样难度最高的极限运动 必须从头开始一步一步地练习， 假如说你努力学习技巧 并且掌握足够的知识（才能从事这样的运动）。
Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition, so I'm training a lot.	当然你需要保持非常好的身体状况（才能从事这样的运动）， 所以我平时花很多时间进行身体训练。
You need to have the best possible equipment.	你同样还需要最顶尖的器材。
And probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.	然而最重要的是 你要学会控制你的意识力，精神力。
And all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly.	这些加起来你就可以尽可能地 达到人类能够飞行的梦想。
So for 2009, I'm training hard for my two new projects.	从2009年， 我在刻苦训练准备我的下两项项目。
The first one, I want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.	第一个，我想打破 一个从悬崖上跳下的翼服飞行的世界纪录。
And I want to set a new record, with the longest distance ever flown.	这个世界纪录， 是用翼服飞行能够滑翔距离最长的纪录。
For my second project, I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before.	我的第二个项目， 是一个轰动性的主意， 是从一个从来没有人跳过的地方跳下。
So now, on the following movie you will see that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in English.	所以从接下来的一段影片众中将看到 我翼服飞行的能力 要比说英语的能力好得多。
Enjoy, and thank you very much.	希望你们喜欢，谢谢。
I have some questions.	（观众鼓掌） （观众鼓掌） 我有一些问题。
I think we all might have some questions.	我认为我们都有一些问题。
Question one: so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does?	第一个问题，翼服飞行的感觉 是不是和人类真正飞翔的梦想一样？
Because it looks like it might.	因为看起来很像。
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much.	Ueli Gegenschatz：是很像。
I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.	我认为这可能是当今 离人类飞翔的最为接近的感觉了吧。
I know the answer to this, but how do you land?	我知道这个问题的答案但是我仍旧想问，你如何降落？
UE: Parachute.	UE: 降落伞。
We have to open a parachute just seconds before, I would say, impact.	我们必须在， 用我的话来说，撞击的前几秒钟内打开降落伞。
It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.	（众笑） 现在还不能只用翼服就能降落。
Yet.	还不能。
But people are trying.	但是人们正在努力实现这个梦想，你是不是其中之一？
Are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it?	 你不是其中之一，那你是不是希望实现这个梦想的人之一呢？
UE: It's a dream.	UE: 这是一个梦想。
We're still working on it and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance, to get more knowledge.	我们仍旧在研发 性能更加好的翼服， 并且学到了许多。
And I believe soon.	我相信在不久的未来。
All right.	好的。
Well we will watch this space.	我们拭目以待。
But I have two more questions.	但我仍旧有两个问题。
What is the -- there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit.	那个从你身后放出的 尾气。
Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?	是不是因为你的翼服有驱动功能？
UE: Nope.	UE: 不是。
It's just smoke.	只不过是烟雾而已。
Coming off of you?	从你身上放出来的？
UE: Hopefully not.	（众笑） UE: 但愿不是。
That seems dangerous.	（众笑） 这个看上去很危险。
UE: No, smoke is for two reasons, you can see the speed, you can see the way where I was flying.	UE: 不危险，烟雾有两个作用， 你可以从烟雾来估测飞行速度，你同样可以 看见我的飞行轨迹。
That's reason number one.	这是第一个作用。
And reason number two: it's much easier for the camera guy to film If I'm using smoke.	第二个作用， 假如我用烟雾，摄像师可以 更加有效方便地跟踪我
Ah, I see.	啊，我知道了。
So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked.	你故意让翼服放出烟雾 所以你就更加容易被跟踪。
One more question.	再有一个问题。
What do you do to to cover your face?	你用什么来遮盖你的脸？
Because I just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards.	因为我在想假如你飞得那么快 你的脸肯定会被风压得不行。
Are you in a helmet?	你是不是要戴头盔？
Are you in goggles?	或者你只带飞行眼镜？
UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.	UE: 最美好，最纯粹的飞行感觉是只戴飞行眼镜。
And is that how you usually fly?	那你平时是不是只戴飞行眼镜？
UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet.	UE: 我通常要戴头盔。
In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet because of landings -- usually it's difficult -- it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.	在山沟中穿梭的话我一直戴头盔 因为降落通常很困难 与普通跳伞不同，普通跳伞有很大的空地让你着路。（而山里却没有空地）
So you have to be prepared.	所以你必须要戴头盔以防万一。
Right.	对的。
Now is there anything you don't do?	现在你是不是会有一些特技你不会去尝试？
Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"	会不会有人拿着一些项目来跟你说：我要你做这个！
UE: Oh of course, of course.	UE: 当然了，当然了。
Some people have crazy ideas and -- ...a round of applause...	有些人很疯狂…… （众笑） 大家再次掌声感谢……
UE: Thank you very much.	（观众鼓掌） UE:非常感谢。
What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what's scheduled.	今天下午，我想做些 和预订计划稍微不同的事
Foreign policy, you can figure that out by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody, but — — I want to talk about young people and structure, young people and structure.	若想了解外交政策 你们可以欣赏，我不知道，Rachel Maddow 或某人的节目 但－－ 我想谈论的是年轻人和结构 年轻人和结构
This was last Wednesday afternoon at a school in Brooklyn, New York, at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.	这是上周三下午 在纽约布鲁克林区一所学校 由耶稣会经营的Cristo Rey高中
And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.	当时我对这群学生演讲，并观察他们
They were around me in three directions.	他们以三个方向环绕着我
You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority.	你们注意到他们几乎都是少数族群
You'll notice that the building is rather austere.	你们注意到这栋建筑十分简陋
It's an old New York school building, nothing fancy.	这是一栋老旧的纽约校舍，十分简朴
They still have old blackboards and whatnot.	他们仍使用旧式黑板等设备
And there are about 300 kids in this school, and the school's been going now for four years, and they're about to graduate their first class.	大约300名孩子在这所学校就读 这所学校已成立四年 首届学生即将毕业
Twenty-two people are graduating, and all 22 are going to college.	毕业生共有二十二人 二十二人都会上大学
They all come from homes where there is, for the most part, just one person in the home, usually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it, and they come here for their education and for their structure.	他们全都来自于－大多来自于 只有一位亲人的家庭 通常是母亲或祖母，仅此而已 他们来这里接受教育 及结构训练
Now I had this picture taken, and it was put up on my Facebook page last week, and somebody wrote in, "Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?"	我拍了这张相片 上星期贴上我的Facebook页面 有人留言说 哼，他为何让他像这样立正？
And then they said, "But he looks good."	接着写道，但他看起来不错
He does look good, because kids need structure, and the trick I play in all of my school appearances is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids, I then invite them to ask questions, and when they raise their hands, I say, "Come up," and I make them come up and stand in front of me.	他看起来确实不错，因为孩子需要结构 我每次造访学校，必定会玩个把戏 当我稍微向孩子们说教后 接着会邀请他们发问 当他们举起手时，我会说，到台上来 让他们在我面前站好

You know that they'll always start yakking.	你们知道，他们总是聒噪不休
And so I play a little game with them before I make them stand at attention.	因此我先和他们玩个小游戏 才让他们立正站好

I'm telling you you didn't shave."	我说的是你没刮胡子

Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.	此时，纽约市立学院 越来越厌倦我的存在
I'd been there four and a half going on five years, and my grades were not doing particularly well, and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.	我在那里读了四年半，将近五年 我的成绩不甚理想 我和校方不时有些摩擦

So, I tell young people everywhere, it ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life that determines where you end up in life, and you are blessed to be living in a country that, no matter where you start, you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself, you believe in the society and the country, and you believe that you can self-improve and educate yourself as you go along.	因此，我经常对年轻人说 并非生命的起点 而是你如何挥洒生命 决定了生命的结果 你有幸生活在这个国家 无论从何处起步，都拥有机会 只要你相信自己 相信这个社会和国家 相信你可以自我提升 随时自我教育

If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people that, "You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out," they'd said, "We're dropping you out.	我们这么做不是为了让你吸毒 或惹是生非，更别动辍学的念头

They stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame: "Don't you shame this family."	他们将羞耻心 彷佛匕首般地刺进我们心坎 别让家族蒙羞

And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people, and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren, it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure, if you reach back and help, if you mentor, if you invest in boys and girls clubs, if you work with your school system, make sure it's the best school system, and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem, not just downtown Montessori on the West Side.	这十分重要，在座各位 都是成功人士 我相信你们都拥有美好的家庭和子孙 这并不足够，你们必须伸出援手 帮助像Cruz先生这样的孩子 他们可以有所成就，如果你们给予他们结构 如果你们伸出援手，如果你们提供指导 如果你们资助男女童军 如果你们和学校系统携手合作 确保它成为最佳的学校系统 不仅是你们孩子的学校 还有那些位于哈林区的学校 不仅是位于西区市中心的蒙特梭利学校

For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university, this was my day job.	自从我五年前 从一所正派的文理学院毕业起 这是我白天的工作。

So after all of our shows, we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people, and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us, and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows, and they would pass the hat, and then they would come in and join us onstage, so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests.	所以我们在表演结束之后一定会签名 拥抱我们的歌迷，和人交流互动， 我们将请求他人给予帮助或加入我们的过程 变成了一门艺术，我会找来当地的音乐家和艺术家 在我们的演出门口表演， 他们会传递一个帽子， 随后他们进入演出场馆和我们一起登上舞台 也就是说，我们有着不断更替的、各种各样的、随机的、古怪的表演嘉宾。
And then Twitter came along, and made things even more magic, because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere.	后来，微博的出现 让事情变得更加神奇，因为 我可以在任意时间和地点提出任何要求。

And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street.	那一刻我决定 我要抓住可能的机会 在网上免费共享我的音乐。 当时Metallica正在声讨Napster 而我Amanda Palmer却在唱反调，鼓励 BT、下载、分享，但是我会请求人们的帮助 因为这种方式在街头是行得通的。
So I fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra, I turned to crowdfunding, and I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made, and I asked my crowd to catch me.	所以我和厂牌斗争，结束了合作， 并与我的乐队the Grand Theft Orchestra， 我开始在人群中融资。 我纵身一跃，跳入我建立的成千上万的联系之中 我请求人群接住我。

And I got a lot of criticism online after my Kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices, specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer, and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website.	Kickstarter上的项目发展壮大之后 我继续在人群中募资的行为 在网络上招来了很多批评。 尤其是邀请喜欢我们音乐的音乐人 上台与我们一同演唱几首歌曲 换取门票、啤酒，加深感情 这是某网站刊登的一张 处理过的我的照片。

I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question, which is, "How do we make people pay for music?"	我认为人们花了大量的精力试图解决错误的问题， 也就是我们如何强迫人们付钱购买音乐？
What if we started asking, "How do we let people pay for music?"	我们应该问一个新的问题， 我们如何让人们主动为音乐慷慨解囊？

The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone.	互联网和手机可以说是 我们这个时代 最为重要的两大发明了
They've changed the world.	它们改变了整个世界
However, largely to our surprise, they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state.	然而，令我们非常吃惊的是 它们同时也成为了 用于国家监视的完美工具
It turned out that the capability to collect data, information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies, mostly U.S. intelligence agencies, watching over the rest of the world.	事实上，收集关于我们 每个人或者说所有人的 数据、信息以及关系的这种能力 正是这个夏天从 西方情报机构 特别是美国情报机构 所透露或者泄露的 这些情报机构监视着世界其它地方
We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6.	六月六日开始 陆续听到一些泄露的消息
Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others.	斯诺登开始透露 那些来源于美国情报机构的 顶级机密信息 于是我们也开始了解到一些 诸如菱镜计划和XKeyscore的事情
And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world.	这些都是美国情报机构 正在运作的项目 以此对抗世界其它国家
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist.	如果你回顾一下乔治·奥威尔 有关监视的预言 你会发现 奥威尔的确是一个乐观主义者
We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined.	如今我们看到的是大规模的 对普通民众的跟踪 这远远超出了他最初的想象
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah.	这就是那个臭名昭著的 美国犹他州的NSA数据中心
Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center.	在不久的将来开放后 它将成为一个超级计算中心 同时也将成为一个超大数据中心
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting.	你几乎可以想象那个被硬盘设备塞满的大厅 无时不刻都在存储 他们收集来的数据
And it's a pretty big building.	这是一幢巨大的建筑
How big?	具体有多大呢？
Well, I can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn't really tell you very much.	我们来看一个数据 14万平方米 可能你对这个数据也没有太多概念
Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.	我们最好通过比较来想象
You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in.	想想你去过的 最大的宜家家具吧
This is five times larger.	它将是宜家的五倍大
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?	想想你能在宜家塞进多少硬盘设备吧
Right?	是吧？
It's pretty big.	数目的确非常巨大！
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.	我们估算仅用于运行 这个数据中心的电费 每年就需要数千万美元
And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades.	而这种大规模的监视 意味着他们可以收集我们的数据 并且基本上可以永久保留 保留很长时间 几年甚至几十年
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all.	这个将给我们所有人 带来前所未有的风险
And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone.	它将是一种大规模的对我们每个人的 无障碍监视
Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners.	当然，确切来说也不是对所有人 因为美国情报机构只有对外国人的 合法监视权力
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States.	一旦那些非美国的数据流 到达或者经过美国 就要被监视了
And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.	监视外国人听起来似乎没那么糟糕 除非你意识到 其实我们都是老外
In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.	事实上，这个星球上96%都是老外
Right?	是吧？
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us, all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.	所以说只要你使用通信工具和互联网 你就会被彻底监视
But don't get me wrong: There are actually types of surveillance that are okay.	大家也别误会 的确也有一些还不错的监视形式
I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine.	我热爱自由，但我自始至终也同意 有一些监视是有益的
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications.	比如如果执法机关正在寻找一名谋杀犯 或者搜捕一个贩毒者 或者试图阻止一场校园枪击案的发生 并且他们中有头目有嫌疑犯 此时如果能监听他们的手机 截获他们的网络通信那就太棒了
I'm not arguing that at all, but that's not what programs like PRISM are about.	我并不反对这一点 但菱镜计划之类的项目并不是这么做的
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings.	他们不是在监视那些 他们有理由怀疑的坏人
They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent.	他们在监视那些 无辜的人
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.	对于这样的监听 有四条主要的理由 首先是只要你 一开始讨论信息泄露的问题 总会有反对者站出来 把泄露的重要性降到最小 他们说我们早已知道这些 我们知道在发生什么，没有什么新鲜的
And that's not true.	事实不是这样的 谁说我们早知道这些？
Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already.	我们不知道
Our worst fears might have been something like this, but we didn't know this was happening.	我们最大的恐惧就是这些事情已经发生 而我们一无所知
Now we know for a fact it's happening.	现在我们的确可以确定的知道在发生什么
We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM.	而我们之前并不了解 我们不了解PRISM
We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans.	也不了解XKeyscore，Cybertrans
We didn't know about DoubleArrow.	还有DoubleArrow
We did not know about Skywriter -- all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies.	以及Skywriter 这些各式各样 由美国情报局运行的项目
But now we do.	但现在我们都了解了
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.	我们之前也并不知道 美国情报机构如何极端到 通过渗透至标准组织内部 以达到削弱加密算法强度的目的
And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file.	这就意味着 如果你拿到一份加密文件 它的加密算法可以安全到 使你加密之后 没有任何人可以解开它
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, it's going to take millions of years.	即便你用地球上的每一个计算机去解密它 也需要数百万年
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.	它可以说是绝密的，无懈可击
You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result.	拿到这样一件完美的东西 然后故意弱化它 使得我们每个人终都变得不安全
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result.	现实生活中一个类似的例子是 情报机构会强行 将某种加密识别码植入每个家居防盗系统 这样他们就可以进入任何一所房子 因为坏人可能装有防盗系统 但这样一来 最后我们自己也变得不那么安全
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind.	利用加密算法这个后门儿 的确让人匪夷所思
But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job.	当然啦，这些情报机构只是在履行自己的职责
This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic.	这正是他们被要求做的事情 做信号情报 监视通讯渠道 以及监测网络流量
That's what they're trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, they're trying to find ways around the encryption.	这正是他们尝试在做的 由于目前相当大一部分的互联网流量是加密的 他们也就在尝试通过加密寻找突破口
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose.	削弱加密算法就是其中一种手段 这是美国情报机构如何 为所欲为 的一个极好的例子
They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control.	他们完全不受控制 而这些应该加以控制
So what do we actually know about the leaks?	而我们对这些信息泄露的真实了解能有多少呢
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden.	所有这些都基于 Snowden先生的那些泄露文件
The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to.	从六月初 第一个PRISM的幻灯片开始 它详细描述了 一个从服务提供商收集数据的项目 而且他们还对那些被使用的 服务商进行了命名
They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers.	甚至为他们设立一个纪念日 记载开始从各个服务提供商 获取数据的日子
So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others: Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on.	比如，他们为2007年9月11号 开始从Microsoft获取的那批数据起了名字 还有2008年3月12号的Yahoo 之后还有Google, Facebook Skype, Apple等等
And every single one of these companies denies.	任何一个公司对此都呈否认态度
They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data.	都说这简直就是谎言 他们从来没有开过后门让别人获取他们的数据
Yet we have these files.	但是我们的确得到了这些文件
So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation?	那么是其中一方在撒谎吗？ 有没有其他可能的解释？
And one explanation would be that these parties, these service providers, are not cooperating.	一种可能的解释是 这些当事人，也就是这些服务提供商 他们并没有合作
Instead, they've been hacked.	只是被黑了
That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.	这种解释是合理的：他们没有参与而是受到了黑客攻击
In this case, they've been hacked by their own government.	其实可以说是他们被自己的政府黑了
That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government.	也许这听起来有点荒唐 但我们的确有过这样的案例 比如那个有关恶意软件Flame的案子 我们之前多么坚信它是由 美国政府授权的 而就是它破坏了Windows的 网络升级系统的安全 这就意味着 他们被自己的政府黑了
And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well.	当然还有更多 支撑这个说法的证据
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies.	德国的明镜周刊暴露了更多 有关这些情报机构中的顶级黑客团队 所做作为的信息
Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.	在NSA内部, 这个部门被叫做TAO 特定情报获取行动 这个等同于英国GCHQ内部的NAC 网络分析中心
And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium.	最近泄露的这三个幻灯片 详细描述了一个由GCHQ情报局 在英国发起的行动 目标定位在 一个比利时的电信公司
And what this really means is that an E.U.	这件事表明了一个事实 一个欧盟国家的情报机构 正在蓄意破坏 联盟国家电信公司的安全 而他们在幻灯片里谈论这件事时 一如既往的自然
country on purpose, and they discuss it in their slides completely casually, business as usual.	这是主要目标 这是次要目标 这是他们的团队
Here's the primary target, here's the secondary target, here's the teaming.	他们通常会在周四晚上在酒吧里做团队建设的活动
They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub.	他们每成功一次 就会用一些俗气的幻灯片 庆祝所谓的胜利
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, "Success," when they gain access to services like this.	他们究竟在搞什么鬼
All countries spy.	也许真的是
And maybe that's true.	所有国家都有间谍
Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example.	很多国家都有，但并不是所有都是这样
Let's take, for example, Sweden.	比如说，瑞典
I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.	我提起瑞典这个国家是因为 在法律方面它与美国是有些相似的
All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support?	 比如像使用Windows或OSX 使用Facebook或LinkedIn 或者将数据上传到类似iCloud中进行云存储 还有Skydrive或者DropBox 也许还有一些在线服务，类似Amazon网络服务或者销售支持？
And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day.	答案是，每一个瑞典的商业人士每天都会使用它们
And then we turn it around.	那么如果我们反过来问
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services?	有多少美国杰出人士 使用瑞典的网络邮箱和云服务呢？
And the answer is zero.	答案是零
So this is not balanced.	所以这显然是不平衡的
It's not balanced by any means, not even close.	相差甚远
And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States.	即使有一天我们偶然发现一个 欧洲人获胜的故事 典型的结局一定是这个服务被美国公司收购
Like, Skype used to be secure.	比如，Skype最初采用端到端的加密
It used to be end-to-end encrypted.	所以还是安全的
Then it was sold to the United States.	后来被卖给了美国后
Today, it no longer is secure.	就不再安全了
So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome.	所以，我们再一次把一个原本安全的东西 弄得不再安全 使得我们所有人最终也都不再安全了
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists.	也有争论说 美国只是在
It's the war on terror.	展开一场针对恐怖分子的战争
You shouldn't worry about it.	本来无需担忧
Well, it's not the war on terror.	但事实上它不是
Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?	是的，我们承认这中间有恐怖分子 我们必须与这些 肆意残害的行为作战 但从那些泄露的消息中我们也知道 他们在使用相同的手段 监听那些欧洲的领导者 截获墨西哥和巴西居民的邮件 甚至联合国总部以及欧盟议会的邮件 他们显然不会在欧盟议会内部 寻找恐怖分子，对吧？
It's not the war on terror.	所以，这不是一场针对恐怖分子的战争
Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?	虽然部分意义上可以说是 恐怖主义的确是存在的 但我们会认为它是一种 必需我们不惜一切代价去全力对抗的现存威胁么？
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists?	美国人民准备为了恐怖分子 而抛弃宪法？
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U.	抛弃那些人权法案？
conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom?	 还有世界人权宣言 欧盟那些关于人权和基本自由的法案 还有出版自由？
Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all?	我们真的认为恐怖主义 需要我们不惜这一切代价吗？
But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide.	是的，人们惧怕恐怖主义 所以也许他们认为这样的监视是合理的 反正也没什么需要隐藏的
Feel free to survey me if that helps.	需要的话那就随便监视好了
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough.	但是，谁说他们没有什么值得隐藏起来的？ 只是他们还没有考虑那么长远罢了
Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure that's the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you can't keep a secret.	因为我们每个人都有隐私 如果你真的认为你没有什么要隐藏的 那你一定要弄清楚这是你告诉我的第一件事 因为这之后我会觉得 不能再信任你 因为你明显不会保守秘密
But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this.	人们对互联网都表现出盲目的诚实 当那些信息开始泄露的时候 许多人问我
And I have nothing to hide.	说他们没有什么需要隐瞒的
I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.	也没有做什么坏事或者违法的事情
Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency, especially a foreign intelligence agency.	而且我也没有什么想要与 情报中心分享的特殊信息 何况还是国外的情报机构
And if we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother.	就算我们真的需要一个老大 我也希望他是本国的 而不是来自国外
And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence.	当信息泄露开始的时候，我最先发表的 一条评论就是关于 当人们使用搜索引擎时， 是如何将信息泄露给了美国情报机构
And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?	两分钟后我收到一条回复 来自一个叫做Kimberly的美国人 他反对我说
What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something?	我又没有发送裸照之类的东西，为什么我还需要担心这个？
And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either.	我回答他说 我发送什么与你无关 当然也与你的政府无关
Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.	因为这就是隐私
Privacy is nonnegotiable.	这一点没什么好讨论的
It should be built in to all the systems we use.	就是应该在我们所用的所有系统得到保障
And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines.	有一点我们需要知道的是 我们对搜索引擎也是在盲目信任
You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes.	只要你透露了你的搜索记录 我就能在五分钟之内 找到那些与之关联的让人尴尬的东西
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families.	我们对搜索引擎的诚实 常常多于对我们的家庭
Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you.	搜索引擎通常也比你的家人 更了解你
And this is all the kind of information we are giving away, we are giving away to the United States.	这就是那些我们 泄露给美国的信息
And surveillance changes history.	监视改变历史
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon.	堕落总统Nixon之类的例子告诉我们这些
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today.	想象下如果他当时有现在这样的情报收集工具会怎么样吧
And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.	我想用巴西总统Dilma Rousseff夫人 做个例子
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.	她就是NSA监视的对象之一
Her email was read, and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said, "If there is no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy."	她的邮件被截获了 她曾经在联合国总部质问 如果没有隐私的权利 就不会有什么真正的言论自由和舆论自由 因此也不可能有有效的民主
That's what it's about.	就是这样
Privacy is the building block of our democracies.	隐私是民主的基础
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies.	一名在安全方面的同行学者Marcus Ranum曾说 如今美国对互联网的态度 就像对待他们的殖民地
So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters.	所以我们已经又回到了殖民时代 我们这些互联网的外国用户 应该把美国当做自己的主人
So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.	Snowden先生曾经受到过种种指责
Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations -- and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming.	有些人谴责他带来了美国云产业 和软件公司的信息泄露问题 而这些谴责就如同 在责备Al Gore 带来全球变暖问题一样
So, what is there to be done?	那么，我们该怎么办？
Should we worry.	我们需要担忧吗？
No, we shouldn't worry.	不
We should be angry, because this is wrong, and it's rude, and it should not be done.	我们应该为这些丑恶的、无礼的、不该发生的事情 而愤怒
But that's not going to really change the situation.	但这些对改变现实无济于事
What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States.	对于世界其它国家来说解决这一问题的方法 就是尝试避开 美国建立的这些系统
And that's much easier said than done.	但这说起来容易做起来难
How do you do that?	该怎么做呢
A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.	任何一个欧洲国家 都没有能力替代 美国制造的操作系统和云服务
But maybe you don't have to do it alone.	但也许我们可以不用孤军奋战
Maybe you can do it together with other countries.	而是与其它国家联合
The solution is open source.	这个解决方案是开源的
By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself.	通过一同构建这样一个开放、免费并安全的系统 我们可以绕开监视 并且每个国家都不再只靠自己的力量
It only has to solve one little problem.	而只需要解决一个小问题
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state.	我们的安全专家Haroon Meer说过 每个国家都只能成为一个小水波 而聚在一起就可以掀起巨浪 从而可以同时载起所有的小船 这个安全，免费并开源的系统 将成为推动我们所有人的彭波巨浪 使我们可以从此 彻底逃脱国家的监视
Thank you very much.	谢谢大家
The substance of things unseen.	事物的本质是不可见的，
Cities, past and future.	城市的往昔和未来也是如此。
In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves, or perhaps pass through to another world.	在牛津，我们或许从刘易斯·卡洛尔的著作， 从纽约市这面镜子里， 试图寻见真我； 或者进入另一个世界。
Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, "As the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes, a fresh green breast of the new world."	或者，正如F·斯科特菲茨杰拉德所写： 每当明月升高， 微不足道的房屋开始消逝， 直到我逐渐意识到这座古老岛屿， 曾是荷兰水手眼中繁花盛开之地， 新世界中一处翠绿的处女地。
My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project.	我和我的同事用了十年时间 重新探索这个失落的世界， 并将其命名为曼娜哈特计划。
We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609, when he sailed into New York harbor.	我们试图探索亨利‧哈德逊船长 在1609年9月12日的下午 航行至纽约港时所见的一切。
And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts, and if I have time still, an epilogue.	而我想把这个故事分成三段讲， 如果时间允许的话，我也想再做一个总结。
So, Act I: A Map Found.	那么，第一部分：一张地图的发现。
So, I didn't grow up in New York.	是的，我并不在纽约长大。
I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here, in the Red Rock Canyon.	正如你们看到的照片，我在西瓦内华达山区 红岩峡谷长大。
And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes.	由于我儿时的经历， 我渐渐地爱上了自然景观。
And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies, I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology.	所以，当我要着手我的研究生课程时， 我学习了景观生态学--这门新兴领域的研究。
Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals.	景观生态学关注诸如 河流、草地、森林和悬崖是怎样 为动植物提供栖息地的问题。
This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world.	而这份经历和学术培训， 使我获得了与野生动物保护协会共事的绝佳机会， 这份工作致力于拯救世界各地的野生动物和野生地区生态。
And over the last decade, I traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos.	在过去的10年中， 我前往四十多个国家， 观察那里的美洲虎、熊、大象， 以及老虎和犀牛。
But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City.	但是每一次我旅途回来，到纽约市。
And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals?	在周末，我就会像所有的游客一样， 爬到帝国大厦的顶楼。 我也会向下俯瞰这里的风景和生态系统， 于是我便疑惑：这里的景观 是怎样为动植物提供居住场所的?
How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?"	它又是怎样为像我这样的动物提供居住地的呢？
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them.	我也会去时代广场，看一看那墙上美丽的女士们， 然后疑惑：为什么没有人关注她们过去的祖辈？
I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan.	我也到中央公园去，看着中央公园起伏的地形， 与此对比的是陡峭的 曼哈顿中城地形。
I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City.	于是，我开始阅读有关纽约市的历史和地理资料。
I read that New York City was the first mega-city, a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950.	我了解到纽约市是第一座特大城市， 在1950年便拥有超过一千万人口。
I started seeing paintings like this.	我开始察看这样的画作。
For those of you who are from New York, this is 125th street under the West Side Highway.	对于你们这些来自纽约的人而言， 这是城西高速公路下的125街。
It was once a beach.	这里曾是一个沙滩。
And this painting has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock.	而这幅图里 有画家奥杜邦坐在岩石上的身影。
And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.	上方的林地便是华盛顿高地， 杰佛瑞虎克灯塔方向，即是今日乔治‧华盛顿大桥横跨的所在。
Or this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village.	再来看这幅图，描绘的是18世纪40年代的格林威治村。
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University -- sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.	国王学院（后来成为哥伦比亚大学）的两位学生 坐在山丘上俯瞰整个村庄。
And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it.	所以我来到格林威治村，想要找到那座山丘。
And I couldn't find that palm tree.	 但是我找不到它，当然也找不到那棵棕榈树。
What's that palm tree doing there?	那棵棕榈树到底在哪呢？
So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map.	所以，我是在调查的过程中偶遇这张地图的。
And it's this map you see here.	也就是你所见的这一张。
It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in.	它被保存在地理信息系统中， 我把它放大。
This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City.	但这幅地图并不来自于哈德逊的时代，而是来自于美国革命时期。 170年后，由英国军事制图员 在英占领纽约市时绘制的。
And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.	这是一张很杰出的地图，现存于伦敦克佑区的英国国立档案馆中。
And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.	它长10英尺，宽3.5英尺。
And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was, right at the end of the American Revolution.	如果我放大到曼哈顿下城区， 你便可以看见纽约市 在美国革命末的模样。
Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.	这里是鲍灵格林，而这里是百老汇街。
And this is City Hall Park.	这里是市府公园。
So the city basically extended to City Hall Park.	所以这座城市基本延伸到市府公园。
And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished, things that have disappeared.	再往上走，便能看到 地形已改变，景观已消失。
This is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City for its first 200 years, and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that.	这个蓄水池，曾是纽约市建立初的200年间 城市的淡水来源。 它也是土著美国人此前千百年来的淡水来源。
You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now, and the beaches that come up from the Battery, all the way to 42nd St.	你可以看到利兹本纳德草地 水流流经此地，即现在的三角地翠贝卡区。 而海滩从炮台 一路延伸至42街。
This map was made for military reasons.	这幅图的绘制出于军事考虑。
They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications that they built.	所以他们标记了道路、楼房 和他们所建造的堡垒。
But they're also mapping things of ecological interest, also military interest: the hills, the marshes, the streams.	但是他们也标记了一些富有生态意义 以及军事意义的事物：山丘 沼泽和水流。
This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water, which used to run its way through Greenwich Village.	这是列治文山，还有米尼塔河。 它从前经由这条路流入格林威治村。
Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.	格拉姆西公园的沼泽在这儿，
Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.	还有莫里山，这儿是莫里之家 200年前在莫里山上。
Here is Times Square, the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.	这里是时代广场， 两股水流在这里汇合，形成了湿地。 这时正值美国革命末。
So I saw this remarkable map in a book.	我在一本书上看到这张了不起的地图。
And I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat."	当时我想，如果我可以对这张地图进行地理座标参照， 把这张地图放在今日纽约市的格局上， 我就能找出 这座城市失落的景观。 一块块地拼出人们熟悉的地貌， 比如人们上班地点和他们居住地方的地貌， 以及他们喜爱的餐厅的地貌。
So, after some work we were able to georeference it, which allows us to put the modern streets on the city, and the buildings, and the open spaces, so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.	所以经过一些努力之后，我们对它进行了地理座标参照定位， 使我们能够把现代的道路、 楼房和空地放到城市中。 这样我们就可以放大蓄水湖的位置。
We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams, and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today.	我们可以将蓄水湖和水流都数字化， 我们也就可以知道它们在今天的城市地理中的位置。
So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography.	有趣的是比照旧的地形 找出现在的位置。
But I had another idea about this map.	但是我对这张地图还有别的想法。
If we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings, and if we take away the open spaces, then we could take this map.	如果我们拿走这些街道，如果我们拿走这些楼房， 如果我们拿走这些绿色空地， 然后我们可以得到这张地图。
If we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time.	如果我们可以展现18世纪的特征， 我们回到过去的时间。
We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals: to the hills, to the streams, to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches, the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.	我们也可以还原过去生态基础的特征： 那些山丘、水流 基本水文、海岸线、海滩…… 那些构成生态景观的基本方面。
Then, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology, and the surface geology, what the glaciers leave, if we make the soil map, with the 17 soil classes, that are defined by the National Conservation Service, if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were, then we can calculate the slopes.	随后，如果我们加上地质学、基岩地质学， 和地表地质学，冰川遗迹； 如果我们制作土壤地图， 包含国家土壤保护所认定的 17种土壤； 如果我们可以制作一个数字地形高度模型 告诉我们那些山丘的高度， 我们就可以计算它们的坡度。
We can calculate the aspect.	是的，我们可以计算各方面的数据。
We can calculate the winter wind exposure -- so, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape.	我们可以计算冬季风的风向-- 也就是冬季风是怎样吹过地面景观的。
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.	地图上白色的部分是不受冬季风侵扰的地方。
We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.	我们收集了美洲原住民勒纳佩族所有曾居住的地点的信息。
And we built a probability map about where they might have been.	然后我们建立了一个他们可能居住地点的地图。
So, the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan, places that are close to water, places that are near the harbor to fish, places protected from the winter winds.	地图上红色的部分指出 曼哈顿岛上最适宜人类可持续居住的地点。 那些靠近水源的， 靠近渔港的， 不受冬季风侵扰的地方。
We know that there was a Lenape settlement down here by the Collect Pond.	我们知道从前有一个勒纳佩族的定居点， 位于南部毗邻蓄水池的地方。
And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture, that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash, the "Three Sisters" garden.	我们也了解到他们有园艺种植的习惯， 他们有美丽的玉米，豆类和南瓜园地， 即蔬菜三姐妹园地。
So, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been.	于是，我们建立了一个模型，来解释这些园地可能存在的地方。
And the old fields, the successional fields that go.	还有过去的园地及其周边园地的情况。
And we might think of these as abandoned.	我们或许会以为它们被遗弃了。
But, in fact, they're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants.	但事实上，它们现在是草地， 为草地鸟类和植物提供栖息地；
And they have become successional shrub lands, and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities.	或是已经形成灌木林地。 这就混合成这张汇集所有生态社区的地图。
And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types.	由此，我们了解到曼哈顿岛曾有55种不同的生态系统。
You can think of these as neighborhoods, as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood -- that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities, the beaches.	你可以把它们想作邻里关系， 各自独特的就像三角地翠贝卡去，上东城区和Inwood区-- 那里有森林和湿地； 水生群落和沙滩。
And 55 is a lot.	55种生态系统很庞大。
On a per-area basis, Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does, than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.	在平均面积的角度上， 曼哈顿岛每英亩拥有的生态群落的数量 甚至比优山美地国家公园多， 也比美国黄石公园和肯尼亚安伯塞利保护公园多。
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.	这实在是非常奇异的景观， 竟能够支持如此奇特的生物多样性。
So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.	接下来，第二部分：一个重建的家园。
So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees, the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan, the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore, the beavers on all the streams, the black bears, and the Native Americans, to study how they used and thought about their landscape.	我们对鱼类、蛙类、鸟类和蜂类进行了研究， 在曼哈顿，曾有85种鱼类， 有已经灭绝的新英格兰草原松鸡， 还有曾经在所有溪流中发现的海狸及黑熊。 我们也研究了土著居民怎样利用、 思考他们的地质景观的。
We wanted to try and map these.	我们想要标记它们。
And to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs.	为此我们做的是 标记它们的居住需要。
Where do they get their food?	他们从哪儿得到食物？
Where do they get their water?	他们从哪儿取水？
Where do they get their shelter?	他们避护住所是什么样的？
Where do they get their reproductive resources?	他们从哪儿得到生殖资源？
To an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat, but to most people, the intersection of these is their home.	对于一个生态学家而言，这之间的交汇便是栖息地。 但对于大多数人而言，这之间的交汇是他们的家。
So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves, you know, what beavers need is "A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows, near the water."	所以，我们想要阅读野外指南，标准野外指南， 就是你们书架上可能会有的那一类。 你知道，海狸需要的是一条流速缓而曲折的溪流， 边上还得有白杨，赤杨和柳树。
That's the best thing for a beaver.	 这就是最适合海狸的。
So we just started making a list.	所以我们开始列表。
Here is the beaver. And here is the stream, and the aspen and the alder and the willow.	这里是海狸，这里是水流， 这里则是白杨，赤杨和柳树。
As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver.	如果这些就是我们所需的地图， 我们就可以预测在哪里你能够找到一只海狸。
Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places.	或者一只牟氏龟，需要湿草地、昆虫和阳光充裕的地方。
Or the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites.	或者是一只山猫，需要野兔、海狸和洞穴。
And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs.	于是我们很快意识到海狸可能会是 山猫需要的东西。
But a beaver also needs things.	但是海狸本身也需要某些东西。
And that having it on either side means that we can link it together, that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species.	所以无论 把它们放在捕食者或被捕食者的一边，我们都能把它们连接起来。 于是，我们有了 这些物种栖息关系的网络。
Moreover, we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist, but you can look up what an aspen needs.	另外，我们也意识到你可以 以一个海狸专家的身份开始研究， 但是你需要知道白杨需要的东西。
An aspen needs fire and dry soils.	白杨喜光，强阳性和干燥的土壤。
And you can look at what a wet meadow needs.	然后你可以知道湿草地需要什么。
And it need beavers to create the wetlands, and maybe some other things.	它需要海狸创造湿地， 或许还有其它的东西。
But you can also talk about sunny places.	但是你可以再想想阳光灿烂的地方。
So, what does a sunny place need?	那么，阳光灿烂的地方需要什么？
Not habitat per se.	本身不是栖息地。
But what are the conditions that make it possible?	但是，在何种情况下才有可能呢？
Or fire. Or dry soils.	或为阳光，或为干土。
And that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.	这样一来，你可以将这些联系画在1000栏的格线上， 左侧也填入1000格资料。
And then we can visualize this data like a network, like a social network.	然后我们将这些数据网状图像化， 就像一个社交网络。
And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan, and everything they needed, going back to the geology, going back to time and space at the very core of the web.	这张网络汇集所有的栖息关系， 所有生活在曼哈顿岛上的动植物， 以及所有它们需要的东西。 我们于是能够回到地质学的范畴， 回到网络核心的时间和空间位置。
We call this the Muir Web.	我们把这叫做缪尔网络。
And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.	如果你放大，它会是这样的。
Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type.	每一个点都代表一个不同的物种 或者一条不同的溪流或土壤种类。
And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together.	而这些灰色的线表示将它们联系起来的关联。
They are the connections that actually make nature resilient.	这些连线恢复了自然生态活力。
And the structure of this is what makes nature work, seen with all its parts.	这种结构则是自然的运作机理， 每一个部分，正如你所见。
We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist John Muir, who said, "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe."	我们把它称作缪尔网络，以纪念美籍苏格兰裔自然学家 约翰·缪尔，他曾说：当我们试着举出一个自身事物， 我们总会发现它被数以千计的看不见的关系牵连， 对于任何宇宙中的事物，这种联系都不能被打破。
So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps.	之后我们引用了缪尔网络并把它带回地图上。
So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th, and Lex and Third, maybe there was a stream in that block.	如果我们想去85街和86街之间的区域， 以及莱克星顿街和3街之间的地方， 或许在那个街区里曾有一条溪流。
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there, and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses, the butterflies, the fish in the stream, the birds in the trees.	或许某种树类曾在那里生长， 还有花、地衣和苔藓， 蝴蝶和水中的鱼， 树上的鸟。
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.	或许还有一只森林响尾蛇生活在那儿。
And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there.	或许一只黑熊曾出没过，或许土著居民也生活在那里。
And then we took this data.	然后我们应用了这些资料。
You can see this for yourself on our website.	你可以亲自访问我们的网站，
You can zoom into any block on Manhattan, and see what might have been there 400 years ago.	你可以放大曼哈顿任何的街区， 然后看一看400年前那里的模样。
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III.	而我们用它来重现景观。 最后，第三部分。
We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.	我们使用了当今好莱坞惯用的工具 来制作这些只有在电影中才看得到的奇幻的自然景观。
And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.	我们尝试图像化第三大道。
So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography.	我们取得并绘制地貌地形。
We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape.	我们还原土壤和河流，恢复以前地貌。
We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities.	我们把生态群落放到地图的顶层，
And feed into that the map of the species.	并填充物种地图。
So that we would actually take a photograph, flying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River, waiting for Hudson to come.	这样一来，我们甚至可以拍照片， 飞跃时代广场，面朝哈得逊河的方向， 等待哈得逊先生的到来。
Using this technology, we can make these fantastic georeferenced views.	使用这种技术，我们有了 这些引人入胜的地理坐标参照景观。
We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.	我们很容易拍摄到曼哈顿岛上任何视角的照片， 然后看一看它四百年前的样子。
This is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today.	这是从东河向莫里山看到 今天联合国总部所在的位置。
This is the view looking down the Hudson River, with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right, looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.	这是俯瞰哈德逊河。 左边是曼哈顿，右边是新泽西州， 朝着大西洋。
This is the view over Times Square, with the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east.	这是时代广场上空的景致， 海狸水塘在那儿，朝东面看。
So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind.	我们可以看见蓄水池，立兹本纳德沼泽在其后。
We can see the fields that the Native Americans made.	我们可以看见那些土著美国人开垦的园地。
And we can see this in the geography of the city today.	我们也可以在今天的城市中看到它。
So when you're watching "Law and Order," and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond, 400 years ago.	所以当你看到电视剧法律与秩序中的律师沿着纽约法院前的阶梯径直走， 要是400年前，他们则是 走进蓄水塘 。
So these images are the work of my friend and colleague, Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today.	这些图像是我的朋友和同事的杰作。 马克波耶尔先生，今天他也在观众席中。
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work.	在这里我希望在座各位可以为他鼓掌， 感谢他的出色表现。
There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.	科技与视觉化技术确实能够有这样的力量， 使我们创造出了如此的图像。 或许这就是看着镜子的两面。
And even though I've only had a brief time to speak, I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.	尽管今天时间有限， 我仍希望你们能够意识到曼哈顿是一个很特别的地方。
The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity.	在这里，你所看到左侧生态是相互关联的， 而这是基于生态的多样性而言的。
It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.	它拥有的活力正是当今世界所需要的。
But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right, which I quite do.	但是我不希望让你们认为我不喜欢右边的地方（现在的曼哈顿）， 事实上，我很爱纽约，让我爱上它的 正是这座城市的多样性和活力， 以及人口稠密区的互相依存、我们是怎样联系在一起的。
In fact, that I see them as reflections of each other, much as Lewis Carroll did in "Through the Looking Glass."	 确实很像是刘易斯卡洛尔在透过镜子看中的想法。
We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time, that they really are the same place, that there is no way that cities can escape from nature.	我们可以比较这两者，并同时在心中拥有它们， 因为它们确实是同一处地点， 城市也是无论如何离不开自然的。
And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.	我认为，这是我们学习如何建造未来城市的一种借鉴。
So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past, but about 400 years from now, what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people, and need to supply what people need: a sense of home, food, water, shelter, reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning.	所以允许我做一个简短的总结，这不仅关于过去的， 而是以后的400年， 我们想到， 城市是人类居住的场所， 需要提供人类需要的东西： 一种家的感觉、食物、水和庇护住所， 繁殖资源和一种有意义的感觉。
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity.	这是一种人类特有的对栖息地的要求。
And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning, about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways, through technology, through art, through science, so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter, and what we need to raise the kids.	也有这么多TED演讲是关于意义的， 关于如何将意义带入我们的生活 的方方面面，通过技术、 通过艺术、通过科学， 多到我认为我们把太多的关注 投向生活方面，同时我们对于 食物、水源、住所， 以及我们所需供给孩子的东西的关注却不够。
So, how can we envision the city of the future?	所以，我们又该怎样展望城市的未来呢？
Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park, and we imagine it without all the cars, and bicycles instead and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains?	那么，如果我们走到麦迪逊广场公园， 想象周围没有汽车， 而是自行车， 以及大片的森林、溪流，而不是下水道和排水管，世界会怎样？
What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs, and streams winding through the city, and windmills supplying the power we need?	如果我们想象在上东区， 有绿色的自然屋顶，溪流蜿蜒穿过城市， 风车提供我们所需的能量，世界又会怎样？
Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area, currently home to 12 million people, but 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan, in only 36 percent of the area, with the areas in between covered by farmland, covered by wetlands, covered by the marshes we need.	又或者，当我们想象，纽约市的大都会地区， 目前是一千两百万人的家， 但未来可能将有一千两百万人住在曼哈顿的人口稠密区， 那仅仅是本区36%的土地面积， 其间被人们所需的农田、 湿地、 沼泽覆盖。
This is the kind of future I think we need, is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan, but that learns from the sustainability of the past, of the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts.	这就是我心目中，人们所需的未来， 一个同样多的生物多样性、 丰富性和活力性的曼哈顿， 同时借鉴了过去的可持续生存之道， 无论是生态学、原始生态学还是大自然的一切。
Thank you very much.	非常感谢！
I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.	大约十年前我创立了随处即兴 当时我刚搬到纽约，对表演和喜剧充满兴趣
Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage, so I decided to create my own in public places.	因为初来乍到，我找不到舞台落脚 于是我决定在公共场所创造我的大舞台
So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.	我们将要看到的第一个活动就是 首届不穿裤子乘地铁

One person's not that unusual.	一个人没有什么稀奇的

They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before.	他们觉得这是自己看到的最搞笑的事情
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now.	你看她在跟他们眼神示意
And I love that moment in this video, because before it became a shared experience, it was something that was maybe a little bit scary, or something that was at least confusing to her.	我最喜欢视频里这一刻 因为这成为一个共同经历 这事也许有点吓人 至少有点让人摸不着头脑
And then once it became a shared experience, it was funny and something that she could laugh at.	但是一旦这一经历被人所共享 我就变成一个搞笑滑稽的主体
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line.	现在到了 6号线第三站
So the video won't show everything.	这个视频不会展示全部
This goes on for another four stops.	接下来还有四站
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.	7个只穿内裤的男人陆续上车
At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train.	第八站一个提着大帆布袋子的女士上车了 一美元一条裤子减价大甩卖 就象别人在车上卖电池或者糖果之类
We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants, put them on and said, "Thank you.	我们每人买了一条裤子穿上 然后对她说：多谢了，真是雪中送炭！

And I love that girl's reaction so much.	我十分喜欢她对此的反应
And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do.	那天晚些时候我又看了看这个视频 这启发了我应该继续做类似的事
And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people.	而随处即兴的宗旨 就是在公共场合创造一个 对其他人来说成为积极经历的场景

And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.	她的反应启发了我 来举办第二届不穿裤子乘地铁
And we've continued to do it every year.	这变成一项年度活动
This January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in New York -- almost every single train line in the city.	今年1月，我们举办了第十届不穿裤子乘地铁 大约有3,500名各种背景的人 在纽约地铁上共同上演了这个好戏－ 几乎每一趟列车上都能见到
And also in 50 other cities around the world, people participated.	同时在世界各地其他50个城市 也有人参与了
As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians, I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects.	我开始在正直公民旅团剧院上即兴艺术的课程 并得以见到其他的创意人士，演员和喜剧明星们 我开始大量收集 对此类行动有兴趣的人的邮件地址
So I could do more large-scale projects.	来扩大我的表演阵容
Well one day I was walking through Union Square, and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005.	一天我经过联合广场 看到这栋楼 于2005落成
And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.	有一个橱窗前一个女孩在跳舞
And it was very peculiar, because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting, and she was very much onstage, and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.	非常奇特的景象 因为周围都很暗 荧光从她背后照过来 就是浑然天成的舞台一样 我不明白她干嘛这么做
After about 15 seconds, her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away.	大概15秒后她的朋友出现了－ 她躲在一个展板后面 她们大笑着拥抱了对方然后跑开了
So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.	估计她们在玩真心话大冒险
So I got inspired by that.	我受到了启发
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do.	我望着整栋楼的正面－一共有70个窗户 我知道怎么办了
So this project is called Look Up More. We had 70 actors dress in black.	这个活动就叫做再抬头看看，我们有70个着黑衣的舞者
This was completely unauthorized.	这未经批准
We didn't let the stores know we were coming.	我们不想商场知道我们的计划
And I stood in the park giving signals.	我站在公园给指示
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out "Look Up More," the name of the project.	第一个指示是每个人都举起这些四英尺高的字母 拼起来就是再抬头看看 即活动名称

And in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us.	实际上，甚至有人从休息室拿了相机 要和我们拍照留念

The managers and the security guards, on the other hand, did not find it particularly funny.	不过，商店的经理和保安 可没觉得这有什么搞笑的
You can see them in this footage.	这个镜头里能看到
They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.	他们穿着黄色或者黑色T恤
And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911.	我们待了大概10钟 经理觉得要打911报警了

Ultimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not, in fact, illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.	最终警察告诉百思买的经理 穿蓝色polo衫和卡其裤 不能算违法

One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras.	经理尝试要 追查我们的相机
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.	他们发现我们几个人在帆布包里藏里摄像机

And that was done also without permission, although no one seemed to care.	这个行动没有经过批准 不过似乎也没人理
So I'd say over the years, one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is: "These people have too much time on their hands."	这几年 我见过Youtube上对于随处即兴 最常见的评论之一是 这帮人真是闲得慌
And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do, and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments, but that one's always bothered me, because we don't have too much time on our hands.	不是每个人都喜欢你做的所有事 多亏这些评论我变得厚脸皮了 但就是这个评论很烦人 因为我们并没有那么闲
The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers, they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way.	随处即兴的参与者 不比其他纽约人空闲时间多 他们只是偶尔选择 一种不同的方式来休闲
You know, every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games.	每年秋天每个周末 就有成千上万的人 去美式橄榄球场看球
And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game, saying, "All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."	从来没见谁看着比赛 说：看台上的这帮人真闲啊！
And of course they don't.	当然不是这样
It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon, watching a football game in a stadium.	这只是一个度过周末下午的美好方式 在体育场看场球赛
But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library.	我觉得200人一齐 在纽约中央车站玩瞬间静止 也是很好的度过下午的方式 或者穿成捉鬼敢死队的样子 在纽约公共图书馆跑来跑去
Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park, or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical, or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.	或者三千多人一齐听着MP3 在公园里无声地跳舞 或者在超市突然放声唱歌 创作出即兴音乐剧 或者一帮人盛装冲进科尼岛的海滩
You know, as kids, we're taught to play.	孩提时候大人教我们玩
And we're never given a reason why we should play.	却从来没问我们为什么要玩
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing.	玩是积极的事情
And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.	我想这就是随处即兴想要表达的
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.	其实我们并没有什么宗旨 也没必要有
We don't need a reason.	我们不需要原因去玩
As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time, then that's enough for us.	只要一件事好玩 是个有意思的想法 看的人也会一同开心 那就足够了
And I think, as adults, we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play.	作为成年人 我们要认识到玩无止尽
Thank you very much.	非常感谢

I still paint. I love art.	我仍然画画，我喜欢艺术。
I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities, and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics, and I see part of my job today, the reason for being here, not just to campaign for my party, but for politics, and the role it can play for the better in our lives.	我喜欢颜色给我们生活 和社会带来的喜悦 我尝试把我身上艺术家的那一面 带进政治， 我发现， 今天我工作的一部分，我站在这里的原因 不只是为我的党派宣传， 也是为政治，以及它在改善我们生活的方面 能起到的作用

So it's time for change.	（掌声) 是改变的时候啦
The rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost.	恢复公共空间 会恢复人们对所遗失的城市 的归属感
The pride of people about their own place of living, and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal, barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.	人们对自己居住地的自豪 以及多来年他们对 公共场所滋生的非法野蛮建筑 的愤慨背后的情感

People started to drop less litter in the streets, for example, started to pay taxes, started to feel something they had forgotten, and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.	譬如说，人们往街上扔垃圾的行为变少了 开始付税金 开始感觉到一度淡忘了的一些事 当城市警察，或说国家本身正在消亡的时候 美就充当了捍卫者
One day I remember walking along a street that had just been colored, and where we were in the process of planting trees, when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop.	记得有一天我走在街上 那里刚被涂上颜色 树木也正在那里栽种 我看到一个店老板和他太太 在店里装一个玻璃门面

And this was not a misplaced feeling.	这不是一种情感错位
Crime did fall.	犯罪率降低了
The freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city, while the barbarism of the '90s brought about a loss of hope for the city.	1990年赢得的自由 带来了城市的无政府状态 90年代的野蛮 导致城市失去了希望
The paint on the walls did not feed children, nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant, but it gave hope and light, and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things, a different spirit, a different feel to our lives, and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics, we could build a better life for each other and for our country.	墙上的图画不能喂饱孩子们 也不会照顾病号或教育无知者 但是它带来了希望和光明 帮助人们看见 还有另外一种办法 另一种精神，另一种对生活的感受 如果我们能把这种同样的热情和希望 引入我们的政治，我们就能够 给我们和我们的国家一个更好的生活

You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.	你完成你的演讲， 然后马上，你就会看到五个人举手 要求你到他们课桌前重新解释整件事。
Students lack perseverance.	二学生缺乏坚持不懈。
They lack retention; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.	三他们缺少持续记忆力，你会发现自己 在3个月后需要完完全全的重新解释这些概念。
There's an aversion to word problems, which describes 99 percent of my students.	四还存在着一种对文字题的反感， 这占了我学生中的99%。
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation.	五这种情况下，剩下的百分之一 正在急切地寻找公式 来解决问题。
This is really destructive.	这实在是毁灭性的。
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows, has a really good description for this.	大卫·米尔希是死木美剧以及其他的精彩电视节目的创造者， 对此他有一个很好的描述。
He swore off creating contemporary drama, shows set in the present day, because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect, it shapes the neural pathways, he said, in such a way that they expect simple problems.	他发誓要停止创造 当代戏剧， 及当今的单元连续剧， 因为他意识到，当人们的脑中 一天四小时想到，例如，两个半男人，没有冒犯的意思， 这就形成了神经传导通路，他说， 以这样一种方式，人们期望简单的问题。
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."	他称这是一种无法做决定的焦虑。
You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.	人们对不能快速解决的事情不耐烦。
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes, three commercial breaks and a laugh track.	人们期望情景喜剧一般可以在22分中结束， 3个广告中断和一个笑声背景。
And I'll put it to all of you, what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.	我告诉你们所有人， 如大家知道的，解决任何问题都不是那样简单。
I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.	我对此很担忧， 因为我将要在我的学生主宰的世界中退休。
I'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way.	当我以这种方式教学，我正在做 对我自己的将来和幸福感 不利的事情。
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning and patient problem solving, it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.	我在这里告诉大家，我们的教科书，特别是 大众常用的教科书，它们教授数学理论 和耐心解决的数学问题， 功能上和打开好汉两个半电视系列剧一样，然后这就结束了。
In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.	非常严肃地说，这是物理教科书上的一个例子，
It applies equally to math.	它同样适用于数学。
Notice, first of all here, that you have exactly three pieces of information there, each of which will figure into a formula somewhere, eventually, which the student will then compute.	首先注意到这里 大家有正好3个信息， 每一个都可以表示成某个公式， 最终， 学生可以以此计算。
I believe in real life.	我相信在真实生活中。
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever, that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance; where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out, or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some.	问问自己，什么问题你们解决过的， 值得解决的， 在此问题中，你提前知道所有信息， 或者你没有多余信息，然后你需要过滤信息， 或是你没有足够的信息， 你需要去查找些信息。
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.	我肯定大家都同意解决问题都不是如上所述那么简单。
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.	我认为，教科书实在是误人子弟。 因为，看看这个，这是一个练习题，
When it comes time to do the actual problem set, we have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.	当要解决实际问题时， 我们在这就有类似问题， 我们只是在交换数字和稍稍调整内容。
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from, it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.	如果学生们不知道这类数学题模式， 而它会帮助向你解释例题， 什么样题你可以返回去找出公式。
You could literally, I mean this, pass this particular unit without knowing any physics, just knowing how to decode a textbook.	你确实可以，我很认真的说， 通过这个测试，没有任何物理知识， 仅仅知道如何解译教科书。
That's a shame.	那是一种耻辱。
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.	我能在数学中更准确得解决这个问题。
Here's a really cool problem.	这是一个很酷的问题。
I like this.	我喜欢这个。
It's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift.	它是关于确定陡度和坡度 在一个滑雪缆车上.
But what you have here is actually four separate layers, and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and, particularly, how when they're compressed together and presented to the student all at once, how that creates this impatient problem solving.	但在这里有四个不同层面。 我很好奇你们哪个可以看到这四个不同层面的， 特别是，它们如何压缩在一起， 一次性的展现给学生， 又如何轻易地解决了问题。
I'll define them here: You have the visual.	我将在这里详细说明它们。你有图像。
You also have the mathematical structure, talking about grids, measurements, labels, points, axes, that sort of thing.	你也有数学结构， 谈到格子，测量，标注， 点，轴，诸如此类。
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about: which section is the steepest.	你有子步骤，它们都引到我们真正想谈论的问题， 哪段是最陡的？
So I hope you can see.	我希望你们能看到。
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer, but we're paving a smooth, straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way.	我真的希望你们能看到，我们在这里 是在谈一个激发兴趣的问题，一个有意思的答案， 但我们在开拓一个平整的，简单明了的路径， 从一点到另一点， 然后祝贺我们的学生，为他们 能够很好的沿路踏过小缝隙。
That's all we're doing here.	这就是我们做的。
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students, we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.	所以我想展示给你们的是，如果我们能以不同方式分开这些， 和学生们一起建造它们， 我们可以迎刃处理所有需耐心解决的问题。
So right here I start with the visual, and I immediately ask the question: Which section is the steepest?	就在这里，我以图像开始， 我马上问个问题： 哪个部分最陡？
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.	这会引起交谈， 因为这个图像创造的方式使你可以用两个答案辩解。
So you get people arguing against each other, friend versus friend, in pairs, journaling, whatever.	这样你可以促进人们互相争论， 朋友对朋友的争论， 一对对，日志式，随便怎样。
And then eventually we realize it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line.	然后我们最终认识到 谈到 在屏幕左手边滑雪的人 或是刚上中线的滑雪的人，这是挺讨厌的。
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A, B, C and D labels to talk about them more easily.	我们认识到如果 我们更简单地谈论带有一些a,b,c,d的标志， 这该是多么好。
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean, we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.	然后我们确定陡峭程度是指什么， 我们认识到这是一个好主意，如果有一些测量 来真的缩小范围，特别是那意味着什么。
And then and only then, we throw down that mathematical structure.	然后，在此之后， 我们放下那个数学架构。
The math serves the conversation, the conversation doesn't serve the math.	数学服务于对话， 对话却不为数学服务。
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.	在这一点，我将展示给你们，10个班里有9个班 能很好的继续解决整个坡度，陡度的问题。
But if you need to, your students can then develop those substeps together.	如果你需要 你的学生可以在一起展开那些子步骤。
Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that -- which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?	你们可以比较这边这个和那个－－ 哪个班处理了耐心解决的问题，以及数学推理呢？
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.	在我的实践中，我一目了然。
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein, who, I believe, has paid his dues.	我这就要谈谈爱因斯坦， 我认为他做了应有的贡献。
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important, and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here, we just give problems to students; we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.	他谈到规划问题的能力是如此重要， 但在我的实践中， 在美国这儿， 我们仅仅把问题交给学生； 我们不把他们参与到问题的形成和规划过程中。
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.	所以我做的90％的事 和我每周5小时的准备时间 是拿问题中非常吸引人的元素， 像在我的教科书里的这些问题， 把它们重组成能支持数学推理和耐心解决问题的方法。
And here's how it works.	这里是它如何运作的。
I like this question. It's about a water tank.	我喜欢这个问题，这是关于一个水桶。
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?	问题是：多长时间可以装满这个水桶呢？
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.	第一件事，我们简化子步骤。
Students have to develop those, they have to formulate those.	学生们必须得展开这些子步骤， 用公式化表达它们。
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.	然后认识到写在那里的东西是他们所需要的所有信息。
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.	没有一个是多余信息，用不着删除。
Students need to decide, "All right, well, does the height matter?	学生们需要决定，好了， 高度重要吗？
Does the side of it matter?	它的尺码重要吗？
Does the color of the valve matter?	开关的颜色重要吗？
What matters here?"	这里什么是重要的？
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.	这在数学课里是不具代表性的问题。
So now we have a water tank.	这样在这里我们有了一个水桶。
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.	多长时间会把它装满，就是这样。
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms, not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks, we go out and we take a picture of it.	因为这是21世纪， 我们喜欢以真实世界的表达方式来谈论真实的世界， 不是以你常在教科书上看到的线条艺术 或是插图艺术来表达。 我们出去应用，并给它照个相。
So now we have the real deal.	现在我们有了真实的东西。
How long will it take it to fill it up?	它要多长时间装满？
And then even better is we take a video, a video of someone filling it up.	更好的，我们录像， 一个人在装满它的录像。
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.	它在慢慢的装满，令人不耐烦的等待。
It's tedious.	这很乏味。
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes, and they're all wondering at some point or another, "Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"	学生们在看他们的表，翻白眼， 他们时不时地想， 伙计，这个要多长时间装满呐？
That's how you know you've baited the hook, right?	这就是你想要引起关注的地方，好。
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me because, like the intro, I teach kids -- because of my inexperience -- I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?	这个问题，就在这里，对我来说很有趣。 因为，像个引言， 我教小孩子，因为我的经验， 我教那些需要辅导的孩子。
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me, so I won't talk about it.	我不教那些不参与数学对话的孩子， 因为他们懂公式， 也知道如何更好地运用公式，甚至比我好。 所以我不讨论这个。
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.	但在这里，每个人都在同一个水平上运用直觉。
Everyone's filled something up with water before, so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"	每个人都装过水， 所以我让孩子们自己回答这个问题：多长时间装满水。
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation.	我让这些在数学上和交谈上感到恐惧的孩子们 也加入谈论。
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses, and kids have bought in here.	我们把名字写到黑板上，把它们连到猜测的答案上， 孩子们把答案带到这里。
And then we follow the process I've described.	然后孩子们遵照我描述的过程。
And the best part here, or one of the better parts is that we don't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher's edition.	最好的部分，或者说，一个更好的部分 是我们没有从 教师版教科书的后面得到答案。
And that's terrifying, because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition, that's great, but it's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.	 因为理论模型总是得出 和教师版后面的答案一样的答案， 这很好， 但谈到错误的来源， 当理论不符合实际的时候，就让人害怕。
But those conversations have been so valuable, among the most valuable.	但那些谈论是如此珍贵， 是最有价值的。
So I'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class.	所以我在这里报导一些很有趣的收获， 关于在数学课程刚开始的时候，学生带有这些预置的 错误征兆。
These are the kids who now, one semester in, I can put something on the board, totally new, totally foreign, and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year, which is just so fun.	这些孩子现在已经学了一个学期， 我能在黑板上写下一些 全新的，完全陌生的问题， 他们能就此展开讨论， 这比他们在学年开始的时候长3，4分钟， 这真有意思。
We're no longer averse to word problems, because we've redefined what a word problem is.	孩子们不再反感数学问答题， 因为他们从新定义数学问答题。
We're no longer intimidated by math, because we're slowly redefining what math is.	孩子们不再恐惧数学， 因为他们在慢慢从新定义数学。
This has been a lot of fun.	这个过程很有意思。
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia, because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation; to let students build the problem, because Einstein said so; and to finally, in total, just be less helpful, because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways: It's buying you out of your obligation, for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.	我鼓励数学教师多多应用多媒体， 因为它把真实世界以高清晰度的图片和全色彩图像带到 你的教室， 来鼓励学生对那个场景的直觉， 来问你可能问的最短的问题， 让那些更细，更具体的问题随着交谈显露出来， 让学生们着手解决问题， 正如爱因斯坦所说， 总而言之，就是给予更少的帮助， 因为教科书在以非常错误的方式帮助大家。 它在免去大家 对耐心问题的解决和数学推理的责任，更没有帮助性。
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.	那为什么现在是作为一个数学教师的绝好时候， 这是因为我们有工具来创造 这个高质量的数学课程，就在我们的口袋里的工具手机等等。
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap, and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.	它无所不在，非常便宜。 还有自由散播它的工具， 在公开授权下， 从没有比现在更便宜或更普遍的社交互联网工具。
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.	不久之前，我把一系列的录像放在我的博客里， 在两周之内它得到6000的观看率。
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying, "Wow, yeah.	我还收到很多我从来没有去过的国家的邮件，有的教师写邮件说： 哦，是的。
We had a good conversation about that.	我们就此展开了很好的讨论。
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better," which, wow.	哦，顺便说一下，这是我如何改善你教学材料的例子。 这么多，喔。
I put this problem on my blog recently: In a grocery store, which line do you get into, the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.	我最近在我的博客上提出这个问题。 在一个杂物店，你排那个队， 一个是有一个手推车和19个商品 或是另一个有4个手推车和3，5，2 和1个商品。
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom, but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later, which is just bizarre, right?	这里牵涉到的线性模型，它成为了我的教学中很好的材料， 但它最后让我上了在几周之前早安，美国的节目， 这的确是不可思议，对吧。
And from all of this, I can only conclude that people, not just students, are really hungry for this.	从所有这些，我只能下此结论 人们，不仅仅是学生， 都非常渴望这个。
Math makes sense of the world.	数学解读世界。
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition.	数学也是描述人们 直觉的词汇。
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education -- whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever -- insist on better math curriculum.	所以我只是鼓励大家，无论你们是什么教育程度， 无论你们是学生，还是家长，老师，决策者，不论是什么， 请坚持更好地应用数学教程。
We need more patient problem solvers.	我们需要更多耐心的问题解决者。
Thank you.	谢谢。

Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies, the really cool companies, the innovative ones, the creative, new economy-type companies -- Apple, Google, Facebook -- are coming out of one particular country, the United States of America?	在座的各位有没有问过自己， 为什么那些 很酷的公司， 那些有创意、懂创新的 新经济型的公司 — — 苹果、 谷歌、脸书— — 都来自同一个国家 美国呢？
Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!	通常当我谈到这一点时，有人会说，Spotify ！
But, yeah.	确实是的。
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.	但这个公司远没有我提到的那几个美国公司的影响力。
Now what I do is I'm an economist, and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company, the industry and the nation, and I work with policymakers worldwide, especially in the European Commission, but recently also in interesting places like China, and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues: Where are the European Googles?	我是一名经济学家， 我所研究的是 在公司、 行业和国家层面上 创新和经济增长之间的关系。 我与各国的政策制定者合作。 特别是为欧盟委员会工作， 最近也为一些生机盎然的国家比如中国工作。 我可以告诉你，我一开始问的那一问题 都曾从他们的舌尖上流出来过， 欧洲谷歌在哪里？
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model, which they understand is different from this old economy growth model?	硅谷经济增长模式背后的秘密是什么？ 他们的做法和 旧的经济增长模式的不同之处何在？
And what is interesting is that often, even if we're in the 21st century, we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state.	有趣的是，通常来讲， 即使我们现在处在 21 世纪， 我们会得出这样的结论，那就是 市场对抗国家。
It's talked about in these modern ways, but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley, the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms, the private initiative, whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies, the gazelles as we often call them, which traditional banks are scared of, or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions, their products, to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail.	这被认为是现代方式。 私人动议，不管这个动议是否 属于动态风险投资范畴， 这些创新型公司都实际上 能够得到高风险融资。 被我们称为羚羊企业的这些领军公司所需要的融资 是那些传统银行所害怕接手的。 另外，不同类型的一些颇有成效的 商业化政策实际上允许这些公司 把他们绝妙的发明、他们的产品 直接推向市场，实际上得以 安然度过被称为可怕死亡谷的时期。 其他的很多公司却在这个时期一败涂地。
But what really interests me, especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world, is the language that's used, the narrative, the discourse, the images, the actual words.	特别是现在， 源于世界上的政治动向， 真正让我感兴趣的是(商业中）使用的语言、叙述方法、 话语、 图像和实际使用的词汇。
So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box.	所以我们常常听到 诸如私营部门之类的词汇 都是更有新意的，因为它能 跳出惯常的思维，
They are more dynamic.	他们更有活力。
Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford, where he said to be innovative, you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.	让我们回想史蒂夫 · 乔布斯 于2005年在斯坦福大学给毕业生做的演讲。 他当时说： 一个人要创新， 就需要保持求知欲，不断地去试错。
Right?	对吧？
So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys, right?	这些人都是些如饥似渴、 懵懵懂懂又个性鲜明的家伙，对吧？
And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector.	在像欧洲这样的地方 社会更公平， 我们甚至被美国人穿得更讲究， 吃得更可口。 但问题在于这些讨厌的公共部门。
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could.	这些部门有些太庞大了，它实际上没法让 像动态风险资本 和商业化这样能够结出 商业硕果的事物存在。
And even really respectable newspapers, some that I'm actually subscribed to, the words they use are, you know, the state as this Leviathan.	即使那些很受人推崇的报纸， 有些我正在订阅的报纸， 你知道，他们把 美国形容成利维坦。
Right?	对吧？ 【译注：利维坦是霍布斯的同名政治哲学著作里虚构出来的庞然大物】
This monster with big tentacles.	有着巨大触角的怪兽。
They're very explicit in these editorials.	他们在他们的社论里非常明确地这样说。
They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution, but you know what, what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet?	他们说，你知道，美国有必要 去修复这些小小的市场失灵。 当你拥有公共物资 或那些负面的外部因素比如污染时。 你知道吗，在互联网之后 下一次科技革命是什么吗？
We all hope it might be something green, or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say -- this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution -- they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?	我们都希望它可能是一场绿色的革命。 或者是与纳米技术有关的革命，为了让新科技革命成为可能，他们说 — 这是关于下一次工业革命的特殊议题 — — 他们说，国家就是要专注于基础建设，对吧？
Fund the infrastructure.	给基础设施和学校建设投资。
Even fund the basic research, because this is popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in, do that, but you know what?	事实上，私营公司不想为 大型的公共设施投资。 这是国家需要做的，你知道吗？
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."	然后把剩下的留给革新者。
Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.	那些个性鲜明、不拘一格的革新家，
They're often called garage tinkerers, because some of them actually did some things in garages, even though that's partly a myth.	通常被称为车库工匠， 他们中有些人确实是在车库里工作的， 这些故事都被传成神话了。
And so what I want to do with you in, oh God, only 10 minutes, is to really think again this juxtaposition, because it actually has massive, massive implications beyond innovation policy, which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers.	所以我想和你们讲的是，天哪， 只剩10 分钟了！ 是我们要再考量并行。 因为这种并行有非常非常巨大的影响力， 超越于某些与我合作的决策者 所在地区的 创新政策之上。
It has huge implications, even with this whole notion that we have on where, when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which, of course, as we know, are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition.	它有非常巨大的影响，甚至影响到整个国家 对我们在何时、何地、为何 要削减公共开支 和其他公共服务部门的开支的决策。 我们知道，正是由于这种并行，一些公共服务部门的工作 已经被更多的外包出去了。
Right?	对吧？
I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.	我是说，我们需要有公立学校或特许学校 通过国民必修课程等的重拳出击 无后顾之忧地把孩子们培养成为创新型人才。
So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy.	所以这些词汇的出现都是有一致性的， 不仅与创新政策有关， 这种并行简直无处不在。
And so to think again, there's no reason that you should believe me, so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.	所以，再回过头来想， 你们不需要相信我， 就想想你口袋里的一些最绝妙的 革新产品吧。 不要打开开关哟。你就拿出来看看你的iPhone吧。
Ask who actually funded the really cool, revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone.	你会问到底是谁给iPhone那些非常酷的 革新性、突破性的 技术投资的。
What actually makes your phone a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?	到底是什么让你的电话 基本上成了智能手机，而不仅仅是一个粗劣的手机呢？
So the Internet, which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world; GPS, where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world; the touchscreen display, which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.	通过互联网，你可以在世界上的 任何地方上网冲浪。 通过GPS，你可以明确地知道 自己在世界的某个地方。 触摸屏显示，使手机真正变成 任何人都可以轻松学会使用的手机。
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone, and they're all government-funded.	iPhone的这些非常巧妙的、革新性的部分 其实全部都是由政府资助的。
And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.	就是说，互联网是由 DARPA美国国防部资助的。
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.	全球定位系统（GPS) 是由军方的 Navstar项目出资的。
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.	甚至语音控制功能 都实际上是由 DARPA资助的。
The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.	触屏显示是 由两个国家部门：中情局（CIA)和国家科学基金会 资助美公立大学特拉华大学的两位科研人员而开发出来的。
So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs, whereas the slight variations of existing drugs -- Viagra, different color, different dosage -- are the less revolutionary ones.	有优先评级的新分子实体药物 是革新型药物。 而对原有药物进行细微改进的— — 比如伟哥，改变药物颜色、 改变药物剂量 — — 这就属于非革新型药物了。
And it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring, Kafkian public sector labs.	结果呢，75%的 有优先评级的新分子实体 都实际上是由，老掉牙的Kafkian 公共部门实验室提供资金。
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.	这并不意味着大型制药公司不把钱花费在创新上。
They do.	他们也这样做。
They spend on the marketing part.	他们也往市场营销这一部分投钱。
They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.	他们只是花钱用于开发市场。
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock, which is quite problematic.	他们花费相当多的资金来购回自己的股票， 这是很成问题的。
In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R&amp;D, but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about.	事实上，辉瑞和安进这样的大公司最近 为了抬高他们的股票价格，花在购买他们自家股票的资金 远远超过他们花在研发方面的资金。 这涉及了一个完全不同的 TED 演讲主题， 有一天我会很高兴讲给你们听的。
Now, what's interesting in all of this is the state, in all these examples, was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.	现在，在所有新研发的例子里，最有趣的是， 美国这个国家， 所做的要比单纯修复市场失灵多得多。
It was actually shaping and creating markets.	它实际上是在塑造和创造市场。
It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research.	它不仅给基本研究投资， 那是典型的公共利益。 它而且给应用研究投资。
It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.	上帝保佑吧，它甚至成了风险资本家（给风险企业投资）。
So these SBIR and SDTR programs, which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital, but also have become increasingly important.	这些小型企业研发资金项目（SBIR和SDTR) 给小型公司提供早期的财政支持。 跟私人风险资本来投资比起来， 对于小企业这是非常非常重要的。 而且变得越来越重要。
Why?	为什么呢？
Because, as many of us know, V.C. is actually quite short-term.	因为，我们很多人都知道， 私人风险投资实际上是相当短期的行为。
They want their returns in three to five years.	他们想在三至五年内得到回报。
Innovation takes a much longer time than that, 15 to 20 years.	可是创新需要比那更长的时间， 通常要15 到 20 年。
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?	这就是整个的概念 — — 我是说，这是重点，对吧？
Who's actually funding the hard stuff?	谁实际上在给研发难题提供资金？
Of course, it's not just the state.	当然，不仅仅是国家政府。
The private sector does a lot.	私营部门也做了很多。
But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics, but not really providing that sort of high-risk, revolutionary thinking out of the box.	但是事实总是告诉我们 国家对于奠定研发的基础非常重要。 但是它并不是那种高风险的 革新性创意本身。
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet to doing the spending, but also the envisioning, the strategic vision, for these investments, it was actually coming within the state.	所有这些公共部门，他们从资助互联网 到负担期间的花费。 这些资金实际上都是来自于国家政府。
The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology, came from within government.	纳米技术部门很醉心于 这项研究。而纳米技术这个词汇本身 就是政府部门给起的。
And so there's huge implications of this.	它当然会带来巨大的影响。
First of all, of course I'm not someone, this old-fashioned person, market versus state.	首先，当然我不是那些， 守旧的认为国家对抗市场的人。
What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.	我们对动态资本主义的理解就是 我们确实需要公共与私人这样的伙伴关系。
But the point is, by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan, I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way.	但问题是,政府部门通常被描述成 一个必要的存在， 但实际上 — —噗 — — 有点呆板 一个通常会带来危险的利维坦。 我想我们真的在阻碍， 以一种真正动态的方式 去建立公共-私人伙伴关系的可能性。
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part, the public part -- well, they're both P's -- with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking.	我们经常为P部分辩解， 公共（public)部分— — 其实，如果说到去风险化， 这可是两个 P — — 公共（public)-私人伙伴关系。
What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking.	在我给大家的讲的这些例子里，以及其他更多的领域里 公共部门的作用 是我和其他的同事都很关心的。
Bring it on.	公共部门也在承担风险，勇往直前。
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.	它实际上也成了创新科技的一部分。
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafkian bureaucrat, I've met him."	但同时，我确定你们都和 地方级、 区域级以及国家级的政府打过交道。 你会说，你知道吧，我见过那个卡夫卡式的官僚。
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.	整个并行的关系其实一直都有的。
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.	那么，有个自我实现的预言
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant, boring, it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way.	是在讲国家是不相干的， 呆板的。有的时候 是我们自己把这些组织机构搞成这个样子的。
So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations.	所以我们现在要做的就是 把这些国家政府机构建成创业型机构。
DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri, actually thought really hard about this, how to welcome failure, because you will fail.	资助互联网和语音控制系统的美国国防部高级研究计划局 实际上对风险投资深思熟虑过， 如何迎接失败呢，因为你总会有失败的。
You will fail when you innovative.	你如果勇于创新，肯定有失败的时候。
One out of 10 experiments has any success.	10次实验中的一次也许会有成功。
And the V.C.	搞风险投资的人当然知道这些。
guys know this, and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success.	 他们其实愿意为那些有过一次成功的 失败者提供资金。
We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course, the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship, and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait, to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds, that whole risk-reward thing.	如果你学过金融课，你会知道 你学到的第一课就大概是风险与回报的关系， 因此有些人愚蠢至极 或者说聪明至极，他们把时间花在 投资股票上，因为股票的风险高 所以随之而来的回报也自然高。 这就是所说的风险回报的关系。
Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?	政府在创新科技上 冒了如此大的风险，那么回报在哪里？ 政府搞什么互联网，是不是傻过了头？
The Internet was crazy.	互联网是疯狂的。
It really was.	确实是。
I mean, the probability of failure was massive.	我的意思说，它带来的失败可能是巨大的。
You had to be completely nuts to do it, and luckily, they were.	你一定得是个傻子采取给它投资。 幸运的是，他们是傻子。
Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.	现在，我们还没提到回报这事儿呢。 除非你把美国政府描绘成冒险家。
And the problem is that economists often think, well, there is a reward back to the state.	问题是经济学家们往往认为， 政府当然有回报呀，那些税收呀。
You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.	 人们得到那些工作，他们的工资得以提高， 然后通过交纳税款回报政府。
Well, unfortunately, that's not true.	可遗憾的是，事实并非如此。
Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.	是的，事实不是这样的，因为许多就业的岗位在国外。
Globalization, and that's fine.	全球化，这没问题。
We shouldn't be nationalistic.	我们不应该持民族主义态度。
Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.	也许我们就应该让这些工作岗位安置在合适的地方。
I mean, one can take a position on that.	我是说，总有人会受雇上岗吧。
But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- Apple's a great example.	但这些公司 其实从政府那儿得到了巨大的好处。 苹果就是一个很好的例子。
They even got the first -- well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.	他们甚至是第一 — — 好吧，也许不是第一， 但是他们确实通过SBIC计划 得到了50万美元的资助。 该计划早于后来的SBIR计划。 同样，我交代过，iPhone背后的所有技术。
And yet we know they legally, as many other companies, pay very little tax back.	但是我们知道在法律上， 和其他公司一样，苹果公司只需要上缴很少的税款。
So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax.	所以我们确实需要重新思考的是 也许需要有一个利润回报机制 让这些公司回报比税款更多的资金给政府。
Why not?	为什么不呢？
It could happen perhaps through equity.	也许可以通过发行股票的方式。
This, by the way, in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically, countries like Finland in Scandinavia, but also in China and Brazil, they're retaining equity in these investments.	顺便说一下，其他国家 实际上也在考虑使用这样的方法。 比如说芬兰、斯堪的那维亚 还有中国和巴西。 他们的政府持有这些创新公司的股票。
Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money, it's a public funding agency in Finland, which then funded the next round of Nokias.	希特拉给诺基亚投资，持有他们的股票，赚了很多钱， 它是芬兰的一个公共的投资机构。 它后来又资助了诺基亚的下一代产品。
Instead, many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained.	可是正相反，许多政府预算 都想这么去做的， 可是资金有限。
But perhaps even more important, we heard before about the one percent, the 99 percent.	但或许更重要的是， 我们之前听过 1%， 99%。
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way, as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism, because that's what we're talking about, right?	如果美国政府能够更有战略眼光， 成为价值生成机制的主导者该有多好。 这就是我们在讨论的重点，对吧？
Who are the different players in creating value in the economy, and is the state's role, has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?	谁在市场经济中充当创造价值的特殊一员？ 考虑到政府的作用， 政府是不是成了市场经济中的候补队员了？
If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back, it might just be that in the next round, and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green, that that period of growth will not only be smart, innovation-led, not only green, but also more inclusive, so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth, because they have not.	实际上，如果我们有一个更广义的 价值生成理论，我们可以允许 政府对科技投资，以期回报。 也许下一轮的科技创新时，我们就可以这样做。 我希望我们期待的下一个巨大变革 会真的是绿色革命。 那个时期的经济增长， 不仅是智能的、 创新主导的、 不仅是绿色的，更应该是包容的， 这样，像在硅谷的那些公立学校 就可以从经济增长中直接受益。 但是他们还没有受益。
Thank you.	谢谢。
There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined -- 40,000, actually.	在这个国家里的中国餐馆 比麦当劳®，汉堡王®，肯德基®和温蒂快餐®加起来还要多。 事实上，有4万家。
Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history, as a matter of fact.	中餐馆在美国历史上发挥了很重要的作用， 这也是事实。
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington, D.C., which unfortunately is closed now, and about to be turned into Walgreen's.	古巴导弹危机 是在华盛顿一个名叫燕京宫的中餐馆里 解决掉的。 可惜的是，它现在关闭了， 而且要改建成沃尔格林连锁药店。
And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll, on H Street in Washington.	而约翰·威尔克斯·布斯 刺杀了林肯总统的那座房子， 现在也变成了一家中餐馆， 就是位于华盛顿的锅和卷。
And it's not completely gratuitous, because wok and roll -- Chinese food and Japanese foods, so it kind of works out.	这个餐馆名也不是完全没意义的， 因为锅和卷， 中国菜和日本菜， 还是有点关系的。
And Americans love their Chinese food so much they've actually brought it into space.	美国人如此的喜欢中国菜， 他们甚至带上了太空。
NASA, for example, serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.	比如说，美国宇航局就把恒温的糖醋猪肉 列入了给宇航员准备的航天菜单。
So, let me present the question to you: If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie, you should ask yourself, how often do you eat apple pie, versus how often do you eat Chinese food.	那么，让我来问你们这样一个问题： 如果我们自身的美国象征是个苹果派， 你应该问你自己， 你多久吃一次苹果派？
Right?	 还有多久吃一次中国菜？
And if you think about it, a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese, for example: beef with broccoli, egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken, fortune cookies, chop suey, the take-out boxes.	如果你仔细想想， 你就会发现 有很多你们认为，我们认为或者美国人认为是中国菜的食物， 中国人并不认识。 比如说： 西兰花牛肉，蛋卷，左宗棠鸡， 幸运饼干，炒杂烩，外卖盒子。
For example, I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China, gave them to Chinese to see how they would react.	例如，我拿了一大盒幸运饼干带回中国， 给中国人吃，来看看他们会有怎样的反应。
What is this?	这是什么？
Should I try it?	我可以尝尝吗？
Try it!	尝一尝。
What is it called?	这叫什么名字啊？
Fortune cookie.	幸运饼干。
There's a piece of paper inside!	里面有张纸啊～
What is this?	这是什么？
You've won a prize!	你中奖了！
What is this?	这是什么？
It's a fortune!	是一个幸运。
Tasty!	挺好吃的。
So, where are they from?	那么，他们是从哪里来的？
The short answer is, actually, they're from Japan.	简单的说，他们是从日本来的。
And in Kyoto, outside, there are still small family-run bakeries that make fortune cookies, as they did over 100 years ago, 30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States.	在京都城外， 现在还有些小型的家庭糕点坊 在制作幸运饼干。 就像他们一百多年以前做的一样。 三十年后幸运饼干就传入了美国。
If you see them side by side, there's yellow and brown.	如果你把他们摆在一起看， 你会发现一个是黄色，一个是棕色。
Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste, so they're not as sweet as our version.	日式的加入了豆面酱和芝麻酱， 没有我们的甜。
So, how did they get to the United States?	那么，他们是怎样传入美国的呢？
Well, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over, and a bunch of the bakers introduced them -- including at least one in Los Angeles, and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo-do, which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan.	简单说来，日本移民来到了美国， 一群面包师就引进了他们。 洛杉矶至少有一家， 在旧金山这里有一家。 名字叫做学习堂。
They back then, actually, made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto.	在那时， 他们制作幸运饼干用的模具 和我们在京都看见的非常相似。
So, the interesting question is, how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese?	有意思的是， 幸运饼干是怎么从日本的东西 变成中国的东西了的呢？
Well, the short answer is, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II, including those that made fortune cookies, so that's the time when the Chinese moved in, kind of saw a market opportunity and took over.	简单的说， 二战时，我们收押了所有的日本人， 包括了那些做幸运饼干的人。 就在这时候，中国人来了， 发现了一个市场机遇，就据为己有了。
So, fortune cookies: invented by the Japanese, popularized by the Chinese, but ultimately consumed by Americans.	因此，幸运饼干， 由日本人发明， 由中国人推广， 而最终给美国人消费。
They are more American than anything else.	他们比任何东西都要具有美国特色。
Another one of my favorite dishes: General Tso's Chicken -- which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.	接下来是我最喜欢的菜肴之一， 左宗棠鸡。 顺便提一下，在美国海军军官学校， 它被叫做左司令鸡。
I love this dish.	我喜欢这道菜。
The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso, and he has marched very far indeed, because he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love.	在我的书中，它原本被叫做 左宗棠将军的长征。 他确实是前进了非常远， 因为他是甜的，是油炸的，是鸡肉做的—— 这三样都是美国人最喜欢的。
He has marched so far, actually, that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.	他前进了如此之远， 连发明了这道菜的厨师都认不出来了。
He's retired, deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong.	退休了，耳聋了，打很多麻将。
So, he -- after this I showed him, he got up, and he's like, "Mominqimiao," which means, "This is all nonsense," and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon.	在我把图片给他看后， 他站起来， 说着莫名其妙 意思是我完全不明白 然后回去继续打了一下午的麻将。
So, another dish.	另外一道我喜欢的菜，西兰花牛肉。
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable; in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.	西兰花不是中国的蔬菜， 事实上，它是意大利的蔬菜。
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s, but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.	19世纪初时，引进了美国， 在20世纪20到30年代开始受到欢迎。
In fact, the Chinese had their own version of broccoli, which is called Chinese broccoli, but right now, what -- they've now discovered American broccoli, and are importing it as a, sort of, exotic delicacy.	中国人也有自己的西兰花， 就是油菜。 但是现在，中国人发现了美国的西兰花， 便开始把它当作外国食物来进口。
I guarantee you, General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life -- and indeed, that actually was a picture of General Tso.	我可以向你保证，左宗棠将军一辈子都没有见过一株西兰花。 这是一种左宗棠将军的图像。
I went to his home town.	我去了他的家乡。
This is a billboard that says: "Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso."	这个宣传栏上写着： 欢迎来到左宗棠的故里。
And I went looking for chicken.	我去寻找小鸡，
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken.	最后找到一头母牛～ 还是找到了一些鸡，
Believe it or not, these guys were actually crossing the road.	信不信由你， 这些家伙还真在过马路。
And -- -- I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town.	还有～ 我发现了一群左宗棠将军的亲戚， 他们仍然在这个小镇上生活。
This guy is now five generations removed from the General; this guy is about seven.	这个人是左宗棠将军的第五代后代， 这个人差不多是第七代。
Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you, and they're like, we don't know this dish.	给他们看了我给你们看的这些左宗棠鸡的图片， 他们都说，我们不知道这道菜。
And then they're like, is this Chinese food?	他们还问，这是中国菜吗？
Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.	因为对他们来说，这看上去不像中国菜。
But they weren't kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them, because in their eyes he is, after all, a famous Qing dynasty military hero.	但是他们并没有对 我大老远跑来拜访他们 而感到惊讶， 因为在他们看来，左宗棠将军 到底是位著名的清朝名将。
He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion, which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ.	他在镇压太平天国运动中发挥了重要的作用。 太平天国运动的发起者， 自称是上帝的儿子， 耶稣的亲弟弟。
And caused the war that killed 20 million people -- still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day.	这场战争中，有2千万人丧生， 至今仍是世界上伤亡最惨重的战争。
So, you know, I realized when I was there, General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America, in that he's known for chicken and not war.	你知道吗，我那时就意识到了， 左宗棠将军有点像美国的桑德斯上校， 因为他是因为鸡肉而不是战争而闻名。
But in China, this guy's actually known for war and not chicken.	但在中国，他确实是因为战争而不是鸡肉 而闻名。
But the granddaddy of all the Chinese-American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey, which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century.	但我们可能要谈到的 所有美式中国菜 的祖师爷 是炒杂烩。 它是在20世纪初的时候 传入美国的。
And according to New York Times, in 1904, there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town, and "the city has gone 'chop suey' mad."	据《纽约时报》指出， 在1904年，整个市镇上下，突然出现了很多中餐馆， 整个城市为了炒杂烩而疯狂。
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized that, whoa, chop suey is actually not known in China.	过了30多年， 美国人才意识到， 原来在中国，没有人知道炒杂烩。
And as this article points out, "The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey."	就如同这篇文章所指出的一样， 中国任何一个城市里的普通老百姓， 完全不知道炒杂烩。
You know, back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan: if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl, you could take her out on a chop suey date.	在那时，有一种办法来显示 你很老于世故有世界意识。 如果你是个男人，你想要给一个女孩留下深刻印象， 那么你可以带她出去吃炒杂烩。
I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another, because chop suey, if you translate into Chinese, means tsap sui, which, if you translate back, means "odds and ends."	我想说， 炒杂烩是一个文化给另外一个文化 开的最大的一个烹饪玩笑。 因为炒杂烩， 如果你翻译成中文， 意思是杂碎，在翻译过来， 就是零碎的东西。
So, these people are going around China asking for chop suey, which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying, I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called "leftovers," and it is particularly -- -- right?	因此，很多人去中国要吃炒杂烩， 这就有点像有个日本人 来到美国说， 你知道你们国家有一道非常有名的菜， 叫做剩菜 —— 对吧？
And not only that: this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving.	还不仅仅是这， 这道菜尤其著名， 是在你们称之为感恩节的节日后。
So, why -- why and where -- did chop suey come from?	那么，炒杂烩 为什么，从哪里来呢？
Let's go back to mid-1800s when the Chinese first came to America.	让我们回到19世纪中页， 第一批中国移民来到美国的时候。
Now back then, the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.	那时，美国人 并不喜欢吃中国菜。
In fact, they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien.	事实上，他们把这些移民当做外星人。
These people weren't eating dogs -- they were eating cats -- and they weren't eating cats -- they were eating rats.	这些人没有吃狗肉， 就在吃猫肉， 没有吃猫肉，就在吃老鼠肉。
In fact, The New York Times, my esteemed employer, in 1883 ran an article that asked, "Do Chinese eat rats?"	事实上，我尊敬的雇主《纽约时报》 在1883年发表了一篇文章说， 中国人吃老鼠肉吗？
And not the most PC question to be asked today, but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time, not so outlandish.	现在看来，这并不是个政治正确的问题， 但是如果你稍微考虑一下当时的普遍情况， 这个问题并没有特别怪异。
This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800s, and if you see, under the word "Clears" -- very small -- it says, "They must go," which refers not only to the rats, but to the Chinese in their midst, because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us.	这是19世纪末期的一个真正的 老鼠药广告。 你看，在清除这个字下面，非常小的字， 写着，一定要赶走他们。 这里的他们不仅仅是指老鼠， 还指生活在他们当中的中国人。 因为当时人们对于食物的理解方式是， 和我们吃不一样的食物的人， 一定和我们不一样。
And another way that you saw, sort of, this sort of, this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this.	你可以看到，对中国人的厌恶情绪 在另外一种方式 表现为这样的文件。
This is actually in the Library of Congress; it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers, hero of our American labor movement, and it's called, "Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion: Meat versus Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism: Which shall survive?	这份文件现存于美国国会图书馆； 是由美国劳工运动的英雄， 塞缪尔·龚帕斯发表的。 它叫做排除华人的一些理由： 肉食对大米：美国男人对亚洲苦力 孰胜孰负？
And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat.	这份文件基本上提出了一个论点， 吃大米的中国人 必然会降低吃肉食的美国人的 生活标准。
And as a matter of fact, then, this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So, with sentiments like these, the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between 1882 and 1902, the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity.	事实上， 这就是为什么我们一定要把他们排斥在我们国家之外 的原因之一。 因此，有了像这样的观点， 《排华法案》在1882年到1902年之间通过了。 那是美国历史上唯一一段时期， 一个群体会因为自己的民族特性 而被特别的排斥。
So, in a way, because the Chinese were attacked, chop suey was created as a defense mechanism.	在某种程度上说，因为中国人被攻击了， 他们就发明了炒杂烩做为一种防卫机制。
Now, who came up with the idea of chop suey?	那么，是谁想出来做炒杂烩的呢？
There's a lot of different mysteries, a lot of different legends, but of the ones that I've found that I thought was most interesting is this article from 1904.	这里有很多不同的传说 但在我发现的一些故事中我认为最有趣的 是1904年的一篇文章。
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says, I want you guys all to stop making chop suey, because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey.	一个叫做林森的中国人 出现在了纽约的唐人街，说道， 我要你们所有人都停止做炒杂烩， 因为我是炒杂烩菜的原始的发明者， 也是唯一的所有者。
And the way that he tells it, there was a guy, there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up, and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.	据他所说， 有个人， 有个很著名的中国外交官来了， 别人叫他做一道菜，要看起来很流行， 可以当作中国菜。
And as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically, the American man has become very rich.	他还说， 我们今天也许都不会说出来， 但是美国人都变的很有钱了。
Lem Sen, who's this guy: I would have made this money, too, but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe.	林森说： 我本可以也赚这么多钱， 但我吧所以时间都花在了寻找那个 偷了我的食谱的美国人。
Now I've come and found him, and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey, or pay me for the right to do the same.	现在我来到了这里找到了他， 我想把我的食谱要回来， 我想要每个人都停止制造炒杂烩菜， 要不就付版权费给我。
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights.	这么看来，这是一次知识产权的 早期运用。
So the thing is, this kind of idea of Chinese-American food doesn't exist only in America.	问题是， 这种美式中国菜 并不仅仅存在于美国。
In fact, if you think about it, Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet, served on all seven continents, even Antarctica, because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station, which is the main scientific station in Antarctica.	只有你想想就会发现， 中国菜是地球上最无处不在的食物， 在七大洲上都有，甚至是南极洲。 因为在南极洲最大的考察站麦克默多站 星期一晚上是中国菜之夜。
So, you see different varieties of Chinese food.	有许许多多不同种类的中国菜。
For example, there is French Chinese food, where they serve salt and pepper frog legs.	例如，有法式中国菜， 他们提供椒盐蛙腿。
There is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies, so they serve fried gelato.	有意式中国菜， 他们没有幸运饼干， 但他们有油炸意式冰淇淋。
My downstairs neighbor, Alessandra, was completely shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."	我的楼下邻居亚历山大 在我告诉她 伙计，油炸意式冰淇淋不是中国的。之后无比震惊。
She's like, "It's not?	她说，不是的？
But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."	但在意大利的每一家中餐馆都有的吃。
And even the Brits have their own version.	英国人也有有自己特色的中国菜。
This is a dish called crispy shredded beef, which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred, and not a lot of beef.	这道菜叫做酥碎牛肉丝， 有很多酥皮，很多碎屑，没有很多牛肉。
There is West Indian Chinese food, there's Jamaican Chinese food, there is Middle Eastern Chinese food, there's Mauritian Chinese food.	还有西印度中国菜， 牙买加式中国菜， 中东中国菜， 毛里求斯中国菜。
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered.	我发现了一道叫做魔术之碗 的菜。
There's Indian Chinese food, Korean Chinese food, Japanese Chinese food, where they take the bao, the little buns, and they make them into pizza versions, and they take -- and they -- like, totally randomly they'll take Chinese noodle dishes, and they'll just Ramen-ize them.	还有印度中国菜， 韩式中国菜， 日式中国菜， 日本人把小包子 做成了比萨。 他们还 很随意的， 他们把中式的面条， 也做出了日式拉面。
This is, like, this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup.	像这个， 在中国的版本中就没有汤的。
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food, which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food, where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas.	还有秘鲁中国菜， 不要和墨西哥中国菜混淆了， 因为后者基本上只是 把所有的菜都做得像墨西哥法士达铁板烧。
And then -- one thing: they have things like risotto chop suey.	还有一个， 他们还有炒杂烩意式调味饭。
My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil, called "Kung Food."	我在整个世界里 见到的所以餐馆中我最喜欢的一个 是在巴西的这个，叫做功夫菜
So, let's take a step back, and kind of, understand what is to be appreciated in America.	让我们退回来一步， 来想想， 在美国有什么值得注意的。
McDonald's has, sort of, garnered a lot of attention, a lot of respect, for basically standardizing the menu, décor and dining experience in post-World War II America.	麦当劳® 获得了很多的关注与尊重， 因为其在二战后的美国 在菜单，装潢和就餐体验方面 树立了一个基本的标准。
But you know what?	但是你知道吗？
They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois, right?	他们实际上 是通过伊利诺斯州的总部 来做的这些的，是吧？
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue, with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters.	我可以说， 中餐馆也做了大致一样的事情， 规范菜单，装潢 甚至是餐馆名称， 但他们没有一个中心总部。
So, this actually became very clear to me with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing, where, you know, they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had, to have three or four second-place winners -- those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers.	于是，在2005年3月30日的超级球抽奖活动中， 我明白了。 那一次抽奖， 他们根据售出的彩票数目 估计会有三四个二等奖获得者， 就是那些猜中了五六个号码的人。
Instead, they had 110, and they were completely shocked.	但他们有110个， 他们完全惊呆了。
They looked all across the country, and discovered it couldn't necessarily be fraud, because it happened, you know, in different states, across different computer systems.	他们在全国上下调查， 发现不太可能是个骗局， 因为这些彩票 是在不同的州，不同的电脑系统。
So whatever it was, it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way.	不管是什么， 有种东西，让人们有了 群体同步行为。
So, like, OK, maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know, like, it was a diamond, or, you know, diagonal.	好吧，也可能是那一小张彩票 上面的某种图案。 就像也许是菱形， 或者是对角线。
It wasn't that.	但不是这样的。
It wasn't that, so they're like, OK, let's look at television, so they looked at an episode of "Lost."	不是这样的，他们就说， 让我们从电视节目上找找吧。 因此，他们看了一集《迷失》
Now, I don't have a TV, which makes me a freak, but very productive, and -- -- and this episode of "Lost," I understand, where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number, which was how long they'd been on the island, but they looked, and the numbers did not match.	我没有电视机， 别人觉得我很古怪，但这使得我工作富有成效～ 我知道，这一集《迷失》 讲的是一个白人的幸运号码， 事实上却不是幸运号码， 讲的是他们在岛上呆了多长时间， 他们对照了， 号码不相符。
So they looked at "The Young and The Restless," and it wasn't that, either.	他们还看了《不安分的青春》， 号码也不对。
So, it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day, and they ask him, "Where did you get your number from?"	直到第二天第一个获奖者出现 他们问他， 你的号码从哪里来的？
He's like, "Oh, I got it from a fortune cookie."	他说，哦，我从一个幸运饼干中得到的。
This actually is a slip that one of the winners had, because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like, oh, no -- like, this can't be true.	这就是其中一个获奖者的幸运签， 因为田纳西州彩票安全局 觉得这不可能是真的，
But it was true, and basically, of those 110 people, and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie.	但这是真的。 这110个人中，基本上有 104个人 的号码是从幸运饼干中得到的。
Yeah. So, I went and started looking.	是的，因此，我开始调查。
I went across the country, looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from.	我跑遍了全国， 来寻找那些 获奖者吃到幸运饼干的餐馆。
You know, there are a bunch of them, including Lee's China in Omaha -- which is actually run by Koreans, but that's another point -- and a bunch of them named China Buffet.	有很多家， 包括在奥马哈市的李氏中餐厅， 事实上那是由韩国人开的，但这不是重点。 还有很多家叫做自助中餐。
So, what's interesting is that their stories were similar, but they were different.	有意思的是，他们的故事都相似， 但却有所不同。
It was lunch, it was take-out, it was sit-down, it was buffet, it was three weeks ago, it was three months ago.	有的是午餐，有的是外卖， 有的是坐下来吃，有的是自助餐， 有的是三星期前，有的是三个月前。
But at some point, all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant, and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies, which, of course we know aren't even Chinese to begin with.	但在某种程度上， 所以这些人都有一个非常相似的经历， 在一个中餐馆，吃了一个幸运饼干。 所有这些中餐馆 都有幸运饼干。 而我们已经知道， 这些饼干一开始就不是中国的。
So it's kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self-organization, right, where, like in ant colonies, where little decisions made by -- on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level.	这就有点像我所说的 自发组织现象。 就像在蚂蚁群中， 在微观层面上做出的小小的决定， 会在宏观层面上产生巨大的影响。
So, a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets.	一个很好的对比是， 麦当劳®的麦乐鸡块。
McDonald's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product.	麦当劳®花了十年 才推出了鸡肉之类的产品。
They did chicken pot pie, they did fried chicken, and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.	他们做了鸡肉馅饼， 炸鸡， 他们最后推出了麦乐鸡块。
And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them, because that's kind of an easy concept, but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner, which is why it took so long for other people to copy them.	麦乐鸡块的新发明， 并没有给他们带来金块， 因为这个想法很简单， 但麦乐鸡块背后的技巧是， 如何用一种划算的方式来 把鸡肉从骨头上剔出来。 这就是为什么过了这么久 才有人模仿他们。
It took 10 years, and then within a couple of months, it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald's in the country.	花了十年时间， 然后在短短几个月之内， 他们就推出了麦乐鸡块， 并在全国麦当劳连锁的整个系统中都推广了， 可真是风行一时。
In contrast, we have General Tso's Chicken, which actually started in New York City in the early 1970s, as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early 1970s, so ...	相反， 我们有左宗棠鸡， 是在20世纪70年代在纽约城里兴起的， 20世纪70年代初期，我也正在纽约读大学～
And this logo!	还有这个标志！
So me, General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related.	于是，我，左宗棠鸡，还有这个标志 都在宇宙范围内有了联系。
But that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City.	但是这道菜也花了将近十年， 才从纽约城里的某家餐馆 推广到全国的。
Someone's like, oh, God -- it's sweet, it's fried, it's chicken: Americans will love this.	有人想到， 噢，天哪～ 这道菜是甜的，是油炸的，是鸡肉做的： 美国人一定会喜欢。
So, what I like to say, you know, this being sort of Bay Area, Silicon Valley -- is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences.	我想说的是，如果这是海湾地区，硅谷 我们可以把麦当劳®看作 是餐饮业的微软。
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux: sort of an open source thing, right, where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system, that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food, you know, depending on the region.	我们可以把中餐馆看作Linux: 一种开源系统，对吧？ 一个人的想法 可以在这整个系统中被复制，被普及。 在不同的地区，就有特别版本的 中国菜。
For example, you know, in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food, where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish, right?	比如说， 在新奥尔良，我们有法人后裔风味的中国菜， 你可以吃到四川短吻鳄和糖醋小龙虾。
And in Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll, which looks like an egg roll on the outside, but a cheesesteak on the inside.	在费城， 你可以吃到费城奶酪牛排卷， 它外面看上去像一个蛋卷， 但在里面有奶酪牛排。
I was really surprised to discover that, not only in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta, because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to -- sorry, from Philadelphia to Atlanta, and brought that with them.	我很惊讶的发现， 不仅仅是在费城有，在亚特兰大也有。 原因是， 一个中国家庭 从费城搬到了亚特兰大， 把奶酪牛排卷也带过去了。
So, the thing is, our historical lore, because of the way we like narratives, are full of vast characters such as, you know, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Chandler with Coca-Cola.	问题是， 我们的历史知识中， 由于我们对于叙事故事的喜爱， 充斥了大量的人物。 比如说，星巴克®的霍尔德·舒尔茨 麦当劳®的雷·克拉克 还有可口可乐®的艾萨·凯德勒
But, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters -- oops -- for example, like Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey, Chef Peng, who introduced General Tso Chicken, and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies.	但是，你知道， 我们非常容易忽视掉小人物。 比如说，发明了炒杂烩的 林森， 发明了左宗棠鸡的 彭厨师， 还有发明了幸运饼干的 所有日本面包师。
So, the point of my presentation is to make you think twice, that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much, if not more, impact on what we eat today.	我这篇报告的目的是， 让你能够反复的思考， 那一些名字被历史遗忘了的人， 对于我们现在吃的食物， 有着同样，也许更加重要的影响。
So. Thank you very much.	谢谢大家。

What is bioenergy?	什么是生物能源？
Bioenergy is not ethanol.	生物能源不是乙醇。
Bioenergy isn't global warming.	生物能源也不是全球变暖。
Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive.	生物能源 与很多人想象的东西不是一回事。
Bioenergy is oil. It's gas. It's coal.	生物能源 石油，是煤炭，是通向 未来的桥梁的一部分。
And part of building that bridge to the future, to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way, or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it.	在那个彼岸，我们终于能够 理性地看待我们的海洋，或者 建立这些地理空间轨道，让它们能高速旋转或者 小幅度地波动，这些都将取决于 我们如何理解并管理好生物能源。
And to do that, you really have to look first at agriculture.	要做到这些， 你必须首先了解农业。
So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years.	人类种植农作物的历史已经有11000年了。
And in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests, you've got to deal with all types of awful things, you've got to cultivate stuff.	 在种植的过程中，我们学会了 如何对付害虫， 还要面对各种各样的麻烦， 培育出新的作物。
In the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate, then you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.	了解到 如何用水来灌溉农田后， 你还要能够把尼罗河水抽取上来。
You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation makes a difference.	你需要有动力设备，才能实现灌溉 产量就会大不相同。
Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the rivers flood.	灌溉使你能够随心所欲地种植农作物， 而不是只能种在 河水能够流到的地方。
You start getting this organic agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this stuff.	你可以开展这种有机农业， 你开始使用机械设备进行生产。
Machinery, with a whole bunch of water, leads to very large-scale agriculture.	 机械化，结合大量的水， 使大规模的农业生产成为可能。
You put together machines and water, and you get landscapes that look like this.	运用机械及水，得到了 现在这样一幅图景。
And then you get sales that look like this.	然后这样的一些 产品就能够销售出去。
It's brute force.	这是巨大外力的作用。
So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system.	 这样一个发展农业的过程，是从 一个原本相当自然的体系起步， 最终去驯服这个自然体系。
You start taming that natural system.	 你把很多外力施加于这个自然体系。
You put a lot of force behind that natural system.	 你使用了大量的杀虫剂和除草剂 在这个自然系统中。
You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- -- behind that natural system, and you end up with systems that look like this.	 你最终把这个系统改造成这个样子。
And it's all brute force.	这是在蛮干。
And that's the way we've been approaching energy.	这也是我们 取得能源的方式。
So the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology.	应此 农业给我们带来的教训是，你可以 在使用大规模外力作用于一个体系的时候 融入这个体系，研究这个体系并将 生物学运用于其中。
And you move from a discipline of engineering, you move from a discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of biology.	你从遵循 机械的原理，运用化学的原理，转为 遵循生物学的原则。
And probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me.	 这个世界上最重要的人之一， 就是我身后的这个人。
This is a guy called Norman Borlaug.	他的名字叫Norman Borlaug。
He won the Nobel Prize.	 他得到了诺贝尔奖。
He's got the Congressional Medal of Honor.	还获得了国会荣誉奖章。
He deserves all of this stuff.	 这一切都是他应得的。
And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds.	 因为他的贡献是让更多的人吃饱饭。 对此他做出的贡献比任何其他人都大。
He did this in Mexico.	 他在墨西哥完成这项研究。
The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution.	 Norman Borlaug教他们如何用更高效的 方法种植粮食作物，掀起一场 绿色革命。
That is something that a lot of people have criticized.	很多人对此 持批评的态度。
But of course, those are people who don't realize that China and India, instead of having huge amounts of starving people, are exporting grains.	当然，那是因为，那些人 没有意识到，中国和印度 不仅不再挨饿， 并且在出口粮食。
And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research, which was Mexico, didn't adopt this technology, ignored this technology, talked about why this technology should be thought about, but not really applied.	具有讽刺意味的是，这个方法 在他进行这项研究的地方——墨西哥 这项技术没有得到应用，反而是被忽视。 有人认为这项技术还有欠考虑的地方， 而没有真正去应用它。
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn't apply technology that was discovered in Mexico.	墨西哥仍旧是世界上最大的 谷物进口国，因为他们没有应用 在他们的国家发明的这项技术。
And in fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point where there aren't statues of this man all over Mexico.	 事实上，他们并不认同这个人， 墨西哥没有这个人的塑像。
There are in China and India.	 而在中国和印度都有。
And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India.	 这个人设立的研究机构现在搬到了 印度。
That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies.	这就是谈论一项技术和应用 这项技术二者之间的区别。
Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world.	现在，不仅仅是这个人的技术让世界上大量 的人有饭吃，而且，这示范了 科学技术所能起到的作用。
It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does, if you understand biology.	如果 你懂得生物学的话。
What happened in agriculture?	农业发生了怎样的变化？
Well, if you take agriculture over a century, agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier.	如果你回头看 一个世纪以前的农业， 1900年的农业跟一千年前的 种植方法没有很大的区别。
Yeah, the plows look different.	是的，看起来，犁的样子 有些不同。
The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules, but the farmer would have understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is why he's doing it, this is where he's going.	人们用上了拖拉机等机械 而不是骡子，但是农民们 知道，这仍是人在操作， 他还是要这么做，没什么太大的不同。
What really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's where you get your productivity increases.	 农业真正开始改变 始自从使用大规模的 机械和化学力量转为运用生物学。
And as you do that stuff, here's what happens to productivity.	并且 从此生产力大大提高了。 自从你那么做以后，产量 这样的变化：
Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100 bushels, to 40, to 15, to five.	基本上，产量从每250个小时生产100蒲式耳， 变为40、15，甚至5个小时就可以生产这么多。
Agricultural labor productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000, whereas the rest of the economy increased about 2.5 times.	农业劳动力 的生产效率提高了7倍，从1950年到2000年间， 其他的经济活动提高的程度是 2.5倍。
This is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person.	这样的提高真是突飞猛进， 人均产出大大增加。
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.	当然，这种效果，看上去 不仅是麦浪滚滚，而是堆积如山了。
And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced.	结果是欧盟百分之五十的预算用于 对农业的补贴，补贴给人们生产出的这些粮食， 无疑已经是过度生产。
This would be a good outcome for energy.	能源要是也有这样的局面就好了。
And of course, by now, you're probably saying to yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology."	 当然，听到这里，你也许会对自己说， 嘿，我想我是来听有关能源的演讲， 可是这家伙在这里大谈生物。
So where's the link between these two things?	那么，这两个事物间的联系是什么呢？
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand.	整个体系中具有讽刺意味的一点是， 我们在讨论对一个我们所不了解的体系要做点什么。
We don't even know what oil is.	 我们甚至都不知道石油到底是什么。
We don't know where oil comes from.	 我们不知道石油是从哪里来的。
I mean, literally, it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from.	 事实上，这至今都是有争议的， 这流动着的黑色物质到底是什么，是从哪里 来的。
The best assumption, and one of the best guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes out of this stuff, that these things absorb sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of years, and you get these black rivers.	最靠谱的假说和猜测， 这种物质来自于这些东西。
And if you think of bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol.	那么，这个理论有意思的地方在于， 如果这个理论是成立的，那么石油 以及所有的碳氢化合物，都是 浓缩的阳光。
Bioenergy is taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas, concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why you get these rainbows.	如果你再来看 生物能源，生物能源不是乙醇，生物能源是 来自于太阳，浓缩在变形虫中， 浓缩在植物里，可能那就是 为什么有这些彩虹。
And as you're looking at this system, if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then bioenergy works in a different way.	你在审视这个体系的时候，如果 碳氢化合物是浓缩的阳光， 生物能源是以不同的方式起作用的。
And we've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels.	我们必须 把石油和其他碳氢化合物看作是 太阳能板的一部分。
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas, the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots.	也许这就是其中的一个原因，当你飞过得克萨斯西部时， 看到那些油井的景象 似曾相识， 它们与堪萨斯的灌溉图景大同小异。
This is how you farm oil.	这就是如何收获石油的景象。
And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started with this brute force approach.	当你想象 石油可以这样收获以及它们是如何演化来的，我们开始 使用采用这种大规模外力的做法。
And then what did we learn?	然后，我们 学到了什么呢？
Then we learned we had to go bigger.	我们学到了必须更大规模地干。
And then what'd we learn?	 然后又学到什么呢？
Then we have to go even bigger.	那就是还要干的 更大。
And we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy.	我们变得破坏性越来越大， 在以这种方式收获生物能源的过程中。
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest trucks in the world are working here, and then you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is basically oil that doesn't flow.	这是阿萨巴斯卡油砂田，油井 星罗棋布，第一步是开采， 世界上最大的卡车在这里工作。
It's tied to the sand.	 因为石油跟泥沙结合在一起了。
And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it, which only works at today's oil prices.	下一步就要用 大量的蒸气使它们分离，其成本之高 只有在现在的高油价下才有可能。
Coal.	煤炭事实上是差不多同样的 东西。
Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants, except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure.	其来源也是植物，不同之处在于 这些植物曾被焚烧，再被高压压碎。
So you take something like this, you burn it, you put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get this.	你就用这一类东西，经过燃烧，把它们置于 压力之下，多半不会得到这样的 东西。
Although, again, I stress: we don't know.	尽管这样，我一再强调：我们并不知道真相。
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff.	我们就这些事情进行辩论是出于好奇。
But as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat kernels look like.	 当你在考虑煤炭时，它们看起来跟燃烧过的 麦子很相似。
Not entirely unlike coal.	这看起来跟煤炭没有太大差别。
And of course, coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines, you get gas.	当然，开采煤炭是非常危险的事情， 因为在一些煤矿里，你会 发现有毒气体。
When that gas blows up, people die.	当这些气体爆炸时，是会死人的。
So you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines, but not in others.	 这些生物气体（比如沼气）存在于有些 煤矿，另外一些煤矿则没有。
Any place you see a differential, there're some interesting questions.	每个地方都有些不同之处，有些问题 很有意思。
There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff.	有的问题诸如 你应该如何对待这些东西。
But again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying exactly the same technology.	但是 仍以煤炭为例，它们可能是同样的东西，可能 是生成与同样的体系，可能就是生物能源，你都在运用 相同的技术。
Here's your brute force approach.	这就是施加大规模外力的方法。
Once you get through your brute force approach, then you just rip off whole mountaintops.	一旦你能够 成功地使用这种方法，结果是 整个山头被夷平。
And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions, which are coal-fired gas plants.	最终是 造成最大单一来源的碳排放， 即燃煤燃气发电厂。
That is probably not the best use of bioenergy.	这也许 并不是对生物能源的最好的利用。
As you think of what are the alternatives to this system -- it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves, nor is China.	当你试图发现还有什么更好的选择， 找到一种替代性的方法是很重要的， 因为人们意识到美国的 石油储备在不断减少，但是 煤炭的储备并未减少，中国也是如此。
There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there, and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy, because if we keep treating them as chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're going to be in deep doo-doo.	 煤炭的储备量非常之大， 我们应该开始考虑把煤炭看作 生物能源，因为如果我们继续视其为 化学能源，或机械能源，我们 会陷入大麻烦。
Gas is a similar issue.	天然气也是类似的。
Gas is also a biological product.	天然气也是一种 生物产品。
And as you think of gas, well, you're familiar with gas.	当你想到天然气时， 你会觉得很熟悉。
And here's a different way of mining coal.	开采天然气的方法 是不同于采煤的。
This is called coal bed methane.	这种气体称为煤层甲烷气。
Why is this picture interesting?	为什么 这个画面很有趣？
Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up -- may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.	因为如果煤炭真的是 浓缩的植物体，那么你在 不同的煤矿发现有不同的气体 有的煤矿会爆炸 而有的又不会，可能都是因为 有些东西吃掉了另一些东西而产生气体。
This is a well-known phenomenon.	这是一个广为人知的现象。
You eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas.	你 吃了某种东西后，会产生很多气体。
It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process.	 那可能也是在生物进程中煤矿中发生的 类似过程。
If that is true, then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it may not be to burn coal.	如果这是真的， 那么从煤炭中获取能源的方法 就可以不必夷平整个山头， 也可能不必燃烧煤炭。
It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture.	也许可以对 煤炭进行某种生物处理，就像在 农业中所做的那样。
That is what bioenergy is.	这才是生物能源的含义。
It is not ethanol.	而不是什么乙醇。
It is not subsidies to a few companies.	 并不是说要补贴几个公司，也不是 进口玉米到爱荷华州，去喂饱那些已经建起来的 乙醇工厂。
It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants.	而是要开始 去理解发生在农业中的转变。
It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture, from brute force into biological force.	 从大规模外力的模式转为使用生物力量。
And in the measure that you can do that, you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it pretty quickly.	 在这么做的过程中， 你可以使很多东西变得清洁， 很快就可以做到。
We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff.	我们在这方面已经有了一些生产力的指标。
OK, if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades, you can get a really substantial increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your output.	 如果你将蒸气打入煤矿 或者油田，它们已经被开发了 几十年，你可以获得明显的 增产，比如产量增加8倍。
This is just the beginning stages of this stuff.	 这还只是最开始的 步骤。
And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who did part of the sequencing of the human genome, who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world -- has been thinking about how you structure this.	在你考虑生物材料时，这个人， 就是他完成了对人类基因组测序的一部分工作， 因为他的工作，基因和蛋白质数据库的数据量 倍增，他为此走遍了全世界， 他也在考虑你将如何构建这个体系。
And there's a series of smart people thinking about this.	 还有很多高人 在考虑这个问题。
And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like, a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are trying to do is to think of, how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force?	他们走到一起 成立了像Synthetic Genomics这样的公司， 还有Cambria、Condon等公司，这些公司 都在试图发现，你如何能够运用 生物学原则来避免使用大规模的外力？
Think of it in the following terms.	请用以下的理念去考虑问题。
Think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.	把这事想象成 为了某种特殊目的开始一项计划。
Think of the cell as a hardware.	把细胞想象成硬件。
Think of the genes as a software.	把 基因想象成软件。
And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable, that can become energy, that can become food, that can become fiber, that can become human beings, that can become a whole series of things, then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way.	在你以这种方式 去想象生命的代码 是可以互换的，可以变成能源，也可以 变成食物，还可以变成纤维，还可以 变成人，可以变成一系列的 各种东西。然后你必须转换 你的思维方法，去构思和设想 能源问题，从一个完全不同于以往的 角度。
What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading?	什么是有关这些东西的最重要的原则？
This is one of the gentle giants on the planet.	 我们应向何处去？
He's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met.	这是这个星球上最温顺的 庞然大物。
His name is Hamilton Smith.	他是你所见过的人里面 最好的人。
He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.	他的名字叫汉密尔顿-史密斯。 这种基因称为限制性内切酶。
He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such a modest guy that the day he won, his mother called him and said, "I didn't realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins.	他当时在霍普金斯，他是如此 谦虚的一个人，在他获奖的那天，他的母亲 问他说：我不知道在霍普金斯还有另外一个 Ham Smith。
Do you know he just won the Nobel?"	你知道他刚刚获得了 诺贝尔奖么？我的意思是，这就是母亲。
I mean, that was Mom, but anyway, this guy is just a class act.	 不过，他本人也正是这样的。
You find him at the bench every single day, working on a pipette and building stuff.	你会发现 他每天都在工作台那里，在用 吸液管构建一些东西。
And one of the things this guy just built are these things.	他做的事情之一 就是制造了这些东西。
What is this?	这是什么？
This is the first transplant of naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell, insert it into a different cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate species.	这是第一次移植的 经过剥离的DNA，你从细胞里提取了整个DNA的 运行体系，注入到不同的 细胞，再把那个细胞培育成另一个 物种。
That's one month old.	这个细胞已经生存了1个月。
You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff.	下个月你将看到 很重要的东西， 象这个一样重要。
And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are, we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies.	当你设想这个东西会给我们带来的 影响的时候，我们正在开始的一种转化， 不是那种享有很高的补贴的，将玉米转化为乙醇 的过程，我们正在开始考虑把 生物学用在能源方面。
We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff, both in economic terms and in energy terms.	这种转化过程 代价很高，不论从经济的角度看，还是从 能源的角度来说。
This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks.	这是一种积聚在阿尔伯塔的油砂中的物质， 大堆大堆的硫磺。
Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur.	因为我们在从油砂中 分离石油的时候，要使用 大量的能源进行蒸馏， 用蒸汽分离这些物质——你同时会分离出 硫磺来。
The difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14 bucks a barrel.	轻质原油与重质原油的差别在于， 它们的价格每桶相差14美元。
That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks.	 这就是为什么你会看到这些堆的象金字塔 般的硫磺。
And by the way, the scale on these things is pretty large.	并且，这些东西的 规模相当大。
Now, if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you really do start applying biological principles to energy.	现在，如果你能够把做这部分工作消耗的能源 减少的话，你就简化了整个体系，并且 开始运用生物学原则于 能源的生产。
This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind, to the point where you can get to solar, to the point where you can get to nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault.	这将是联系各种新能源的桥梁， 诸如风能的利用，太阳能的利用， 以及核能的利用，等等。
Just a thought.	 这还仅仅是个设想。
But in the meantime, for the next decade at least, the name of the game is hydrocarbons.	与此同时，至少在今后的几十年里， 唱主角的都是碳氢化合物。
And be that oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're dealing with.	可以是 石油，可以是天然气，可以是煤炭，都是我们的 研究对象。
And before I make this talk too long, here's what's happening in the current energy system.	我不想把这个演讲拖得 太长，这里介绍一下目前的 能源体系的发展。
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons.	我们消耗的能源的百分之八十六 是碳氢化合物。
That means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff.	这意味着我们消耗物质的百分之八十六 是植物、变形虫和其他这类物质 演化而来的。
And there's a role in here for conservation.	那么这里就有一个 环境保护的角色。
There's a role in here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to get that other portion right.	还有一个 可替代物质的角色，同时我们必须 把其余的部分也做好。
How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future.	我们如何对待其余的那个比例是 我们通向未来的桥梁。
And as we think of this bridge to the future, one of the things you should ponder is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today inside those wells.	当我们把这看作是通向未来的 桥梁时，有一件事必须认真思考： 现在我们把大约三分之二的石油留在 那些油井中。
So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there.	这样我们花费巨大的 开支，把大部分的能源留在 地下。
Which, of course, requires more energy to go out and get energy.	当然，这样做需要更多的能源 去获取其他能源。
The ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol.	这个比值会变得 很愚蠢，如果你取得的是乙醇的话。
It may even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and the energy output.	 那样做，产出的能源与消耗的能源之比 几乎就是一比一。
That is a stupid way of managing this system.	这是在用一种很傻的做法 管理这个体系。
Last point, last graph. One of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices.	最后一点，最后一张图表，我们必须做的 事情之一是稳定石油价格。
This is what oil prices look like, OK?	 这就是石油价格的走势，对不对？
This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low.	这是一个很糟糕的体系，因为你的 最低资本预期回收率设置的很低。
People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for wind, or for something else, and then guess what?	人们想出了 很好的太阳能板的设计，或者是利用 风能或其他的方式，猜猜会怎么样？
The oil price goes through the floor.	石油价格跌破了最低点。
That company goes out of business, and then you can bring the oil price back up.	那些公司 只好破产，然后石油价格又 重新上涨了。
So if I had one closing and modest suggestion, let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States.	因此，我最后要提出一个温和的建议， 让我们在欧洲和美国设定一个稳定的 石油价格。
How do you do that?	怎么能做到呢？
Well, let's put a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it basically says for the next 20 years, the price of oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40 bucks.	那么，我们可以在 油价上加一项税——非收入税， 基本理念是说在最近的20年中，石油价格 将是——随便假设一个数字，35美元也好， 40美元也罢。
If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax it.	如果欧佩克的油价低于这个价格，我们 就开征这项税。
If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax goes away.	如果油价高于这个价格，这项税 就取消。
What does that do for entrepreneurs?	这样做对企业家有什么好处呢？
What does it do for companies?	对公司企业 有什么好处呢？
It tells people, if you can produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or less than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a business.	这可以告诉人们，如果你能以 低于35美元或40美元的价格生产能源， 或低于50美元一桶的价格生产能源， 我们可以竞争——你就能赢得生意。
But let's not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as OPEC drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening.	 我们不能让人们进入这样 一种循环，企业付不出研发费用 而破产，这就等于让欧佩克操纵了石油替代品的研发 使生物能源无法取得成功。
Thank you.	 谢谢。
Who are we?	我们是谁?
That is the big question.	这是一个很大的问题。
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained, super-intelligent ape.	但是从本质上讲，我们只不过是能够直立行走、拥有一个相对较大的大脑、 智力超群的猿猴罢了。
This could be us.	这个可能就是我们（若干年前）。
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.	我们属于人科这个家族。
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth.	我们这个物种的学名叫做智人 记住这个很重要。 至于我们今天在这个世界上所属的位置， 以及我们的未来，
We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today.	我们是 今天生存在这个星球上的 大约五千五百种哺乳动物种的一种。
And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times.	而这只是曾经生活在地球上的 所有物种的一小部分。
We're one species out of approximately, or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years.	我们是在过去的6-8百万年中 生存过的16种能够直立行走 的猿类动物之一。
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.	但就目前所知，我们是唯一至今还存活在地球上的 直立行走的猿类，除了倭黑猩猩以外。
And it's important to remember that, because the bonobos are so human, and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.	记住这一点是很重要的, 因为倭黑猩猩和人类如此相像, 他们99%的基因都与我们相同,
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.	同时我们跟有限的几种现存猿类有着共同的祖先。
It's important to remember that we evolved.	要记住我们由猿进化而来，
Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.	我知道这对有些人来说是不敬的说法, 但我们的确与大猩猩、黑猩猩和倭黑猩猩 有着同样的祖先。
We have a common past, and we have a common future.	我们有同样的过去，和同样的未来,
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today.	而且要记住的是所有的猿类 都有着同样有趣的进化旅程, 就像我们人类一样。
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.	正是这个旅程对人类意义重大, 也正是这个旅程成为了我们家祖上三代以来 一直关注的焦点。 我们一直在东非寻找我们祖先进化的化石遗存， 试图把这些碎片拼起来，重现人类的进化过程。
And this is how we look for them.	这就是我们寻找的过程.
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.	一群非常敬业的年轻人慢慢的行走在 广袤的非洲大地, 在搜寻露出地表的骨头和化石碎片。
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.	这仅是一个例子， 是我们在肯尼亚北部搜寻化石的一个例子。
I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.	我怀疑许多观众看不清楚 图片里的化石。 但如果你仔细看，这里有一个颚骨--下颚--， 属于一个四百一十万年前直立行走的猿类， 是在Turkana lake的西边找到的。
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past.	这是非常耗时，耗力的一项大工程, 而且即将有越来越多的人参与其中， 重构我们人类的进化史。
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.	至今为止我们还没有一个完整的框架。
When we find a fossil, we mark it.	当我们发现一片化石后，我们对它进行标记。
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.	今天我们有了先进的技术，我们有全球定位系统GPS.
We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it.	我们用GPS的位置信息对它进行标记， 同时我们也对化石进行数码拍照， 以便于我们能够把它放回原来的位置， 就是我们找到它时的确切位置。
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.	如今我们可以把这些信息放到地理资源系统中进行分析。
When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.	当我们发现了重要的信息， 例如人类祖先的骨骼化石, 我们就开始非常小心翼翼的对它进行挖掘， 使用牙签和很细的毛刷。
And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.	然后所有的遗骸都要经过这个筛子进行过滤， 然后还要进行再次过滤， 寻找小骨头碎片，之后再进行清洗。
And these things are so exciting.	做这件事经常让我很兴奋。
They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.	这些是唯一的, 或者是第一次跟人类的会面。
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors.	这就是一个非常特殊的时刻，使我跟母亲一起 挖掘出猿人的骨骼残骸的时刻,
And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother.	这是你跟母亲一起做的 最特别的事情之一。
Not many people can say that.	并不是很多人都能够这么说。
But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.	现在，让我把你们带回到200万年前的非洲.
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa, it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.	我想指出的是，你要是仔细看看非洲的地图， 它的形状实际上跟人类的头颅十分相似。
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.	下面我们来到非洲东部去看看东非大裂谷.
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi.	它实际上开始于亚丁湾， 一直延伸到马拉维湖，
And the Rift Valley is a depression.	裂谷是一条深陷区域，
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin, carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.	这是一个盆地，河流从高地流进盆地, 带着很多沉积物，其中夹杂了曾经生活在那一带的动物骨骼残骸。
If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried.	如果你想成为一个化石，那就要死在那些 骨骼会被迅速埋藏的地方。
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface.	然后你就盼望着地球的运动 能将这些骨骼重新带回到地球表面。
And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you.	然后你还要期望我们其中的一员 将会找到你的化石碎片。
OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors, because it's incredibly difficult, A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved, and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.	所以说，这是一件让人自豪的事情，我们对我们的祖先 能了解到我们现在所了解的程度， 因为这是及其困难的, 首先，这些东西要能被埋藏和保留， 其次，它们要能够重新露出地表面。
And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains, and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.	我们其实用了50年去寻找这些骨骼碎片, 并开始拼凑我们进化的故事 .
So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country, Kenya.	让我们看看turkana湖，它是一个湖盆地 在我的国家肯尼亚的最北部。
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there.	如果你看北边，有一条很大的河流流入湖中， 河流携带了含有动物遗迹的沉积物 那些曾经生活在那一带的动物。
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin, which represents some 20,000 square miles.	化石可能在湖盆的任何位置被发现， 也就是大约2万平方英里的区域。
That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.	这是我们碰到的一项大工程。
Two million years ago at Lake Turkana, Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors, actually lived in this region.	2百万年前在Turkana湖, 直立猿人，我们人类祖先的一支， 就曾经生活在这个区域。
You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north.	你可以看到我们在北部涉足过的 一些主要的化石遗址。
But, essentially, two million years ago, Homo erectus, up in the far right corner, lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.	但事实上两百万年前 右上角的直立猿人, 和其余的三个种类的人类祖先都曾居住在这一带。
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there.	这里是一个直立猿人的颅骨， 我刚从架子上拿下来的。
But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.	但并不是说地球上只能存在单一物种，
In fact, if you go back in time, it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.	事实上，你要是回到从前, 多种人科动物并存， 或者拥有共同祖先的人科动物并存是很常见的事情。
Where did these things come from?	他们来自何方？
That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.	这正是我们试图找到答案的问题。 而且意识到物种的多样性是非常重要的， 我们的祖先也不例外。
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana.	这里是一些化石的重建结果， 它们是在Turkana湖被发现的。
But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya, essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains.	我很幸运在肯尼亚长大， 能陪伴父母亲去Turkana湖 去寻找祖先的足迹。
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough, fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.	当我们长到一定年纪的时候，我们曾经挖出了 像长嘴鳄这样的化石，
And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.	我们还挖出了巨星龟，大象骨骸这样类似的东西。
But when I was 12, as I was in this picture, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.	这张图片是我12岁时拍的, 那时候在湖盆西部产生了一个让人兴奋的发现， 他们发现了直立猿人的骨骼.
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died.	我对这个骨架记忆犹新， 因为他死去时的年纪跟我那时候的年纪正好一样。
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.	我把他想象成一个个头很高的黑小伙。
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.	他和兄弟们一定跑了很长的路 去追赶猎物，而汗流浃背。
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.	他会用石头当做工具，
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here, actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.	这个个体，就是我手上拿着的这个， 事实上他的背不是很好--很可能在孩童时受过伤.
He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller, members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.	他由于脊柱侧弯因此必须一直 要女性悉心照料 他可能是家里比较小的成员，年仅12岁.
Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out.	不幸的是，他掉进沼泽里 再也没能出来.
Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved.	实际上，他的骨头很快被埋没， 并至今保存完好。
And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.	他一直躺在那 直到160万年后 这位非常有名的化石猎人,Kamoya Kimeu, 沿着一个小山坡 发现一小块头颅骨骼露在表面 躺在鹅卵石中间，他意识到这是祖先的头骨骼.
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.	其实就是最上面的这一小块头颅骨骼。
Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment.	挖掘工程立即开始了, 越来越多的头颅碎片 从沉淀中提取.
And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.	这是一项多么有趣的事啊-- 头颅骨向树边移动, 这棵树是在离现在很近的时候长成大树的， 但他发现头骨碎片已经在山坡上找到了水流。 于是它决定长出自己的根须，将骨头围住， 防止它们被水流冲走。
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones, the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones, things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.	我们陆续发现了尺骨，指骨, 骨盆、脊椎、肋骨、锁骨, 这些对于直立猿类来说都是史无前例的发现。
It was truly exciting.	实在太令人兴奋了.
He had a body very similar to our own, and he was on the threshold of becoming human.	他的骨骼和我们非常相似, 而且他代表的就是即将进化成人的一类。
Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa, and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.	不过，没过多久，这类物种 就开始向比非洲更北的方向迁移， 他们的化石就逐渐在 在格鲁吉亚、中国，以及印度尼西亚的一些地方被发现。
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe.	所以，直立猿类是第一个离开非洲的人类祖先， 之后他们就开始遍布全球了。
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned, from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.	有一些令人振奋的发现，我前面提到过， 是在格鲁吉亚共和国的Dmanisi 发现的。
But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.	最近又有一些让人惊喜的发现 发生在印尼弗洛雷斯岛上， 有一群人类祖先被隔离在了岛上， 他们逐渐变成了侏儒，只有大约一米高。
But they lived only 18,000 years ago, and that is truly extraordinary to think about.	他们生存在距今只有一万八千年前, 这是真正值得我们去研究的问题。
Just to put this in terms of generations, because people do find it hard to think of time, Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.	如果用代来计算的话， 因为这样人们理解起来比较方便， 直立猿人是在9万代之前离开非洲的。
We evolved essentially from an African stock.	我们人类的血统基本上都是从非洲承传而来的。
Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.	我们人类大概经历了20万年进化成今天的样子，
And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.	而我们离开非洲只有7万年。
And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes shared the planet Earth.	而且直到3万年前，至少有三个能够直立行走的类人猿 同时生活在这个星球上。
The question now is, well, who are we?	现在的问题是：我们到底是谁？
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.	毋庸置疑，我们是环境污染，浪费资源，强取豪夺的物种， 偶尔做一些好事情。
For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.	大多是时候我们的行为不令人愉悦。
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.	我们比先人有着体积更大的大脑。
Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?	这究竟是一个有益的进化过程，还是我们向着 地球上最短寿灵长动物这个方向发展的必经之路？
And what is it that really makes us us?	是什么使我们成为我们？
I think it's our collective intelligence.	我想是我们集体智慧的结晶。
It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness.	使我们记录历史的本领， 以及我们的语言和意识。
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones, we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels: we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.	从最原始的开端，使用着最简陋的石器工具， 到现在及其发达的工具，人类对工具的使用 以经达到了一个前所未有的水平。 我们已经有能力登陆火星，我们还能绘制人类基因组， 最近我们由具备了重组生命的本领，这归功于Craig Venter.
And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world, from extraordinary places.	我们已经能够跟世界上任何角落的人们 进行沟通，不管从什么偏远的地方。
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya, we can talk to people about what we're doing.	即便是在肯尼亚北部的山洞里。 我们能够告诉外界我们在做什么。
As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us, we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet.	像阿尔戈尔提醒我们的那样， 在这个地球上生存的人口 已经非常庞大了。
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time.	人类祖先只能在地球上生存, 如果你看这些化石记录, 他们每次只能平均存活一百万年,
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.	作为一个物种，我们人类存在了仅仅20万年， 而我们的数量已经达到了65亿多。
And last year, our population grew by 80 million.	去年，我们的人口增加了8千万。
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.	我的意思是，这个数字是相当庞大的。
You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.	这里，还是引用阿尔.戈尔的书，
But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.	我们的技术 已经对人口增长失去了制衡的作用。
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today.	我们必须控制这个数字，我认为 这跟我们所从事的其他任何事情是同等重要的。
But we have to control our numbers, because we can't really hold it together as a species.	我们必须控制我们的人口数量 因为人太多了这个物种的生存就会有问题。
My father so appropriately put it, that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species."	我的父亲说得很对， 我们人类是唯一的能够有意识的做出 不利于自身生存的选择的动物，
Can we hold it together?	我们能够很好的生存下去吗？
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.	有一点很重要：我们都是从非洲大陆上进化而来的，
We all have an African origin.	我们都有一个非洲血统，
We have a common past and we share a common future.	我们有着同样的过去和共同的未来.
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.	对进化而言，我们只是昙花一现，
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today.	我们坐在悬崖边缘， 我们拥有最好的工具和科技 去帮我们实现让我们这个物种 继续生存下去的目标。
We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.	如果我们想的话，我们当然可以告诉每一个人，
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?	但我们会这样做吗？还是听从大自然的选择？
Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.	最后，我们乐观面对, 从进化的角度而言, 这到头来也许是一件不错的事情，
I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.	让它顺其自然吧,非常感谢.
It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and I believe this is true, especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success.	常言道，别人家的东西 总比自己的好。 我信这话， 尤其是当我听到奧巴馬总统 常常大谈韩国教育系统， 视其为成功典范。
Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not everyone can do well in that environment.	嗯，告诉你吧， 韩国学校系统，人称高压锅 机制僵化， 竞争激烈， 那种环境不会每个人都受得了的。
While many people responded in different ways about our education system, my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building.	虽然大家对 我们的教育系统反应不一， 我对这个高压环境的应对办法是 用我公寓楼旁边捡到的 木片做弓 。
Why bows?	为什么做弓呢？
I'm not quite sure.	我不清楚。
Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure, my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows.	也许，面对持续的压力， 我这山顶洞人的生存本能 自然就联系到弓箭了。
If you think about it, the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times.	设想一下， 弓自史前时代起就真的帮助推进了 人类生存。
The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty, where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.	朝鲜王朝统治时期， 我家三公里范围内 都是桑树林， 桑叶用来养蚕。
In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact, the government has planted mulberry trees.	为了提高大家对这一历史事实的认识， 政府栽种了很多桑树。
The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.	鸟把桑树籽 带到本市高速公路隔音墙附近 一带，到场都是， 高速公路隔音墙是1988 年奥运会时建的。
The area near these walls, which nobody bothers to pay attention to, had been left free from major intervention, and this is where I first found my treasures.	这些墙附近, 无人管理， 树木任意滋长。 我就是在那儿第一次找到了宝藏。
As I fell deeper into bow making, I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.	当我对制弓越来越着迷时， 我开始走出我的小区去找材料。
When I went on school field trips, family vacations, or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes, I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.	当我去学校户外活动时， 同家人度假时，或仅仅是在我从课外班 回家的路上时， 我在树丛附近徘徊， 用我偷偷地塞进书包的工具 收集树枝。
And they would be somethings like saws, knives, sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel.	工具有锯、刀、 镰刀和斧头， 我在树枝上盖了一条毛巾。
I would bring the branches home, riding buses and subways, barely holding them in my hands.	我把树枝带回家， 又是公共汽车， 又是地铁的， 我勉强抱着走。
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.	我没有把工具带到长滩来。
Airport security.	机场安检。
In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust, I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape.	我自己的房间里，满地木屑， 我独自在里面整夜地又锯，又刨光， 终于做出了弓的模样。
One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire.	一天，我正在改一片竹子的形状 结果把竹片给烧着了。
Where?	在哪儿烧的？
The rooftop of my apartment building, a place where 96 families call home.	在我公寓大厦屋顶， 里面住着96户 家庭。
A customer from a department store across from my building called 911, and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned.	大楼对面的一家百货公司的顾客 打了 911， 我跑下楼去告诉我妈妈， 当时我头发一半都烧焦了。
I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom, in the audience today: Mom, I was really sorry, and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.	我妈妈现在就坐在观众席上， 我想籍此机会，告诉妈妈： 妈妈，当时我真的很抱歉， 并且，以后再着火我一定更小心。
My mother had to do a lot of explaining, telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson.	当年，我母亲被迫一再解释， 一再跟人家讲，她儿子没犯 故意纵火罪。
I also researched extensively on bows around the world.	我当时还广泛研究世界各地的弓，
In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow.	其间，我尽力融汇贯通， 取古今韩外各弓之长， 致力于做出世界上最高效的弓。
I also worked with many different types of wood, such as maple, yew and mulberry, and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before.	我试了各种木材， 如枫树、 红豆杉和桑树， 还到市内高速公路旁边的树丛里 做了很多次射箭实验， 就是我之前提到的树丛。
The most effective bow for me would be like this.	我认为：最有效的弓 应该是这样的。
One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow.	第一：弯度适宜的箭尖，这样，拉弓射箭时， 能最大限度地弹射出去。
Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight, which means more power.	第二： 箭弦内拉，让射手能拉满弓， 这样射出的力量更大。
Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage.	第三：在弓的外层使用动物的腱， 以期存储更大拉力。
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.	第四： 用角来存储受压的能量。
After fixing, breaking, redesigning, mending, bending and amending, my ideal bow began to take shape, and when it was finally done, it looked like this.	经过固定，拆卸，再设计， 修补、 弯曲和修改， 我理想的弓初具雏形， 终于做成时， 弓是这样的。
I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own.	独自发明了如此完美的一把弓， 我洋洋自得。
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum, and see how my bow resembles them.	这是韩国传统弓的图片， 是在博物馆照的， 请看一下我的弓有多像这些弓。
Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention.	感谢列祖列宗， 抢了我的发明。
Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage.	通过做弓， 我有幸接触到我先祖的文化传统。
Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me.	学习经年累月积累下来的知识 和读取祖先遗留下来的信息 胜过任何的心理疗法， 强过任何一位在世成年人所能给我的忠告。
You see, I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near.	你看，我当初上下求索， 偏偏没在身边找。
From this realization, I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before.	认识到这一点之后， 我开始对韩国历史产生了兴趣， 之前我对韩史都毫无感觉的。
In the end, the grass is often greener on my side of the fence, although we don't realize it.	总之，原来自己家篱巴里的草 才更绿呢， 尽管我们不意识到这一点。
Now, I am going to show you how my bow works.	现在，请看我的弓怎么样。
And let's see how this one works.	各位请看：
This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights.	这是竹弓， 拉力45 磅。
A bow may function in a simple mechanism, but in order to make a good bow, a great amount of sensitivity is required.	也许，弓机制功能简单， 但为了做把好弓， 正所谓：差之毫厘，失之千里。
You need to console and communicate with the wood material.	您要安抚联络 这些木头材料。
Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being, and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow.	木头里的每一丝纤维 都有其存在原因和作用， 只有其通力合作 才能成就一把好弓。
I may be an [odd] student with unconventional interests, but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you.	我可能是个 [怪] 学生 爱好特异， 但我希望通过分享我的故事 为这世界尽我一份绵薄之力。
My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind, where everyone is needed exactly where they are, like the fibers and the tendons in a bow, a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient.	我的理想世界里 没有落后生， 人人各司其职， 仿佛是弓的纤维和筋， 刚中有柔， 柔中带刚。
The bow resembles me, and I resemble the bow.	这弓就仿佛是我， 而我仿佛是这把弓。
Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you.	现在，我正把我的一部分向你射去。
No, better yet, a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind.	不对，说的再美妙一些，我心灵的一部分 刚刚向你的心灵射去。
Did it strike you?	射中你了吗？
Thank you.	谢谢。
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?	好，你们中有谁查过这个单词？
You know, in a dictionary?	用字典？
Yeah, that's what I thought.	是的，我想也就这个样子。
How about this word?	这个单词呢？
Here, I'll show it to you.	看看解释：
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.	Lexicography:编纂字典的活动。
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."	注意，这是专用的说法，定义里用编纂这个词。
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite, out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.	字典并不是从一大块岩石里凿出的花岗岩， 而是由很多的小块小块合起来的。
It's little discrete -- that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.	分离的， 英语里边的串法是 D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E——小块
And those bits are words.	我们这里说的小块就是指单词了。
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer -- besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words, like lexicographical.	作为字典编纂者的好处—— 除了有机会来 TED演讲以外，就是可以说很有趣的单词， 例如，lexicographical,字典编纂学。
Lexicographical has this great pattern: it's called a double dactyl.	这个词有一种很棒的押韵， 扬抑抑格。
And just by saying double dactyl, I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red.	只要说到扬抑抑格， 古怪指数就可以飙升到红色警戒。
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."	其实， lexicographical与 higgledy-piggledy有一样的押韵。
Right?	对吧？
It's a fun word to say, and I get to say it a lot.	这个词单发音就很好玩， 我常常说它。
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.	同时，作为字典编纂者，一个让人郁闷的地方 是字典从来没有给人留下一个温暖，舒适的印象。
Right?	对吧？
Nobody hugs their dictionaries.	没有人会拥抱他们的字典。
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.	但是，其实人们通常对字典的看法是这样的。
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.	告诉你一件事情，我没有什么纂字哨子，
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary, and keep the bad words out.	尽管大家认为我的工作是让所谓的好词 做一个有难度的左转拐入字典， 而把所谓的坏词挡于门外。
But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.	问题是，我不想当交通警察。
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.	首先，我不喜欢制服。
And for another, deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy.	而且，决定谁是好词 谁是坏词其实一点也不容易，
And it's not very fun.	还不好玩。
And when parts of your job are not easy or fun, you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.	如果你的工作中有这么一部分既不容易又不好玩， 你就会千方百计去回避它。
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.	由此，如果要找一种工作 来比喻我在干的活，我宁可当一个渔夫。
I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.	我要在英语这个深蓝的海洋里撒上我的大网， 看可以从海里捕到什么珍异的海产。
But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?	可是现实中，为什么人们期望我去当交警而不是渔夫呢？
Well, I blame the Queen.	这，是英女王的错。
Why do I blame the Queen?	为什么我要责怪她？
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.	首先，责怪女王比较有趣，
But secondly, I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed.	另外的原因是， 自维多利亚女王以来，字典并没有什么变化。
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.	我们对字典的理解自维多利亚女王统治时期以来没有改变过。
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965.	在现代字典里，唯一不会让女王欢喜的是 对脏话的引入， 自1965年起出现在美国字典里。
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.	看看这位先生，维多利亚时期的，
James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.	詹姆斯 穆雷，牛津英语字典的第一位编辑。
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.	我没有像他那样的帽子，我多希望有这样的一顶帽子。
So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today.	就是他 把我们至今还认为是现代的元素放在字典里。
When a guy who looks like that, in that hat, is the face of modernity, you have a problem.	如果把一个如此打扮的人，看那帽子， 作为现代的代表，那你们就有麻烦了。
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.	詹姆斯•穆雷即使活在今天也还是能为任何一本字典担任编纂工作，
There'd be virtually no learning curve.	而无需学习曲线。
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!	当然，你们中的有些人会说，计算机！
Computers!	计算机！
What about computers?	计算机是新东西吧？
The thing about computers is, I love computers.	不要误会，我喜欢计算机，
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.	我超级喜欢计算机，
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.	如果有人不让我用谷歌的图书搜索，我一定会绝食抗议。
But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.	但是，在字典编纂工作中，计算机能起到的作用， 就是加快了编纂的工作进程，仅此而已。
They don't change the end result.	计算机没有改变最终结果。
Because what a dictionary is, is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.	因为字典就是 维多利亚时代的设计和现代推动力的整合。
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.	没什么，就是一台电动的脚踏车。
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!	给维多利亚时代的设计加上一个引擎，仅此而已！
The design has not changed.	设计上没有任何变化。
And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?	好，那线上字典呢？
Online dictionaries must be different.	线上字典不一样了吧。
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.	这是牛津线上英语字典，目前最好的线上字典之一。
This is my favorite word, by the way.	看一下一个我喜欢的词，
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.	Erinaceous:属于刺猬的；刺猬的本性。
Very useful word.	非常有用的词。
So, look at that.	看看这里，
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.	线上字典目前就是把纸质版本放到屏幕前。
This is flat.	还是很平面。
Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!	两个！
Right?	对吧？
Those little buttons, I had them all expanded except for the date chart.	那些小按键 ， 除了日期纪录，我把他们都展开了。
So there's not very much going on here.	没什么东西，
There's not a lot of clickiness.	没什么可以点击。
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.	事实上， 线上字典继承了 印刷品几乎所有的毛病，除了搜索功能。
And when you improve searchability, you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.	而当搜索功能改善了， 你同时也把印刷品的优势拿走，那就是能不经意间有新的发现的能力。
Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for, because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.	你能发现一些并不是你要找的东西， 其实是因为找到你想找的东西是如此困难。
So -- -- now, when you think about this, what we have here is a ham butt problem.	所以，，现在，当你想到这些， 我们面对的问题其实是火腿屁股的问题。
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?	有人知道火腿屁股的问题吗？
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.	有个女人正在弄火腿，给一个大家庭做晚餐。
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away, and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like, "This is a perfectly good piece of ham.	她正要把火腿根部切去扔掉， 看着那片火腿，她想， 这其实是块好肉，为什么我要把它扔掉呢？
Why am I throwing this away?"	
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."	她继续想，可是我妈都是这么做的，
So she calls up mom, and she says, "Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"	于是她打电话给她妈妈，问， 妈妈，为什么你做火腿的时候要把火腿屁股切掉？
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"	她妈妈说，我不知道，我妈一直都这么做的！
So they call grandma, and grandma says, "My pan was too small!"	于是她们又打电话给外婆，外婆说， 我的锅太小了！
So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.	所以，这不是因为有好词和坏词的存在，
We have a pan that's too small!	只是我们的锅太小了！
You know, that ham butt is delicious!	要知道，其实火腿屁股味道可好了！
There's no reason to throw it away.	没理由把它扔掉。
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map, they think, "This map sucks!"	所谓的坏词——当人们想去一个地方， 却不能在地图上找到这个地方， 他们就认为，这地图一点用也没有！
When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook, they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool!	当人们发现一个旅游指南上没有的夜店或酒吧， 他们又认为， 旅游指南上没有的，这地方一定很酷！
It's not in the guidebook."	
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think, "This must be a bad word."	而当人们发现一个字典上没有的单词，他们就觉得 这个一定是坏词。
Why?	为什么呢？
It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.	这其实更像是一本坏字典的问题。
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?	为什么要责怪火腿比锅大呢？
So, you can't get a smaller ham.	你不能找到小一点的火腿，
The English language is as big as it is.	因为英语本身就很大。
So, if you have a ham butt problem, and you're thinking about the ham butt problem, the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive: paper is the enemy of words.	所以如果你知道火腿屁股这事儿， 而你又正在考虑这个问题， 它引向的结论是决绝又有违直觉的： 纸张是文字的敌人。
How can this be?	怎么可能？
I mean, I love books. I really love books.	我爱书，非常的爱书。
Some of my best friends are books.	我的一些最好的朋友就是书。
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.	但是书本并不是字典最好的载体。
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.	有人会疑惑不要吧，
People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"	人们不是要把优美的纸质字典拿走吧？
No.	不是。
There will still be paper dictionaries.	纸质的字典还是会存在的。
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.	当我们有了车，当车成了主要的交通工具， 就不见得要把所有的马匹都毙了。
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.	纸质的字典还是会存在的， 只是不会再是主要的载体了。
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.	书本形式的字典不将是唯一形式的字典， 而且不会是 将来字典的原型。
So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint, artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.	设想一下，如果你有人为的制约， 这种制约就会引致 一个武断的区分和一个倾斜的世界观。
What if biologists could only study animals that made people go, "Aww." Right?	如果生物学家只研究 人们喜欢的动物，对吧，
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals, and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?	如果我们以审美角度来判断动物， 只研究我们觉得可爱的动物，这会怎样？
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna, and not very much about much else.	我们就只能了解那些有魅力的大群落， 对其它的物种就不太了解了。
And I think this is a problem.	我认为这是一个问题。
I think we should study all the words, because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts.	我们应该研究所有的词， 因为使用词可以创造出美丽的表达， 即使是从非常卑下的部分。
Lexicography is really more about material science.	字典编纂学是研究物质的科学。
We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression: your speeches and your writing.	我们在研究不同物料的偏差， 当你去架构你的表达的时候： 你的演说和写作。
And then, often people say to me, "Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"	于是人们常常对我说， 那好，我怎么知道这词是真实存在的？
They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts, how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?	他们认为，好，如果词语是 我们用于表达思想的工具， 那你怎么可以说起子比锤子要好？
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"	你怎么可以说这种锤子比那种锤子好？
They're just the right tools for the job.	它们只是合适的工具而已。
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"	由此，人们对我说，我怎么知道一个词是真正的词？
You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real.	任何读过儿童读物的人 都知道，爱让事物变真实。
If you love a word, use it.	如果你爱一个词，用它。
That makes it real.	这样子，它就成真了。
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.	词放在字典里只是人工的区分，
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.	这并没有让一个词变得比其它词更真实。
If you love a word, it becomes real.	如果你爱一个词，它才会变真实。
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic, if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less about control and more about description, then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile.	如果我们不需要花心思在指挥交通上， 如果我们超越了纸张，如果我们少担心 控制而更关注表述， 那英语就成为 一个美丽的活物了。
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.	当其中的一个小组件变化了， 被触动了 ——任何时候你接触到一个单词， 你把它用到新的内容中，你赋予它新的涵义， 你就让它活起来了——让它移动了。
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful.	你没有破坏它，只是让它移到一个新的地方， 这新的地方也可以是一样美丽。
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection, or the cars get confused.	现在，你不再是交警—— 交警管理交通的问题是 要么你得在每个十字路口都安排交警， 要么就让车辆犯糊涂。
Right?	对吧？
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic, but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.	然而，如果你的目标不再是指挥交通， 而是去数来往的车辆，那越多双眼睛越好。
You can ask for help!	你可以找人帮忙！
If you ask for help, you get more done.	越多人帮忙，你可以完成更多的活。
And we really need help.	我们真的很需要帮忙。
Library of Congress: 17 million books, of which half are in English.	国会图书馆有一千七百万本藏书， 一半是英语，
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it, that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.	假设其中每十本书 有一个词不在字典里， 那就相当于超过两本非缩略版字典的词汇量。
And I find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like "un-dictionaried," for example -- in almost every book I read.	我发现没收录到字典里边的词—— 以一个像 un-dictionaried 那样的未收录词为例—— 在我读过的几乎每一本书里都有。
What about newspapers?	还有报纸呢？
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759, 58.1 million newspaper pages.	报纸藏品从1759年开始， 共有五千八百一十万个报纸页面。
If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it, it would be an entire other OED.	只要每100页 报纸有一个没有收录的单词， 那就相当于一整本 OED了，
That's 500,000 more words.	超过五十万词，那是很大的词汇量。
I'm not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time.	我还没有说到杂志，博客—— 一周内，我在 BoingBoing发现的新词 比新闻周刊或时代杂志还多。
There's a lot going on there.	那里正在创造出很多的新词。
And I'm not even talking about polysemy, which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves.	这还没说到一词多义， 有些词有贪心的习惯， 自己有好几个意思。
So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow, a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff, and there's one numbered definition in the OED.	当你想到一个词set—set可以指獾的穴， 也可以指伊利沙白时代衣领上的褶—— 在 OED 里就有好几个定义，
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.	在 OED 里set共33种定义。
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.	小小的一个单词，33种定义。
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."	其中一个只是说不同的技术时态。
Do you know what that says to me?	你知道这对我来说意味着什么？
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub.	那就是说周五下午某人想去酒吧。
That's a lexicographical cop out, to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."	用字典编纂学的术语来说， 就是 不同的技术时态。
So, we have all these words, and we really need help!	有那么多词，我们真的很需要帮助！
And the thing is, we could ask for help -- asking for help's not that hard.	事实上，我们可以寻求帮助—— 要求帮助并不困难。
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.	字典编纂不是开发火箭。
See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers, and this is more of a visual explanation.	看，我刚给了你很多词和很多数字， 这里是个更形象的解释。
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language, these bright spots are what we know about, and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.	我们可以把字典当作代表英语的地图， 这些亮点是我们已知的， 黑点是未知的。
If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.	如果这个地图指美国英语的所有单词，我们还有很多不知道。
And we don't even know the shape of the language.	我们连整个语言的轮廓也不知道。
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida, but there's no California!	如果这个是字典，美国英语地图—— 看，我们有个大致的佛罗里达州了， 可是还没有加州！
We're missing California from American English.	连加州都还没有，
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.	我们知道的确实很不够，我们甚至连缺了加州这个事情也不知道。
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.	我们连地图里有个空白也不知道。
So again, lexicography is not rocket science.	再强调，字典编纂不是开发火箭。
But even if it were, rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days.	即使是火箭开发科学， 当今也有热诚的业余爱好者参与其中了。
You know?	是吧？
It can't be that hard to find some words!	发现词语不可能有那么难！
So, enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.	足够多的科学家在其它领域 正寻求大家帮忙，而且大伙也干的不错。
For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings.	例如，有一种电子鸟，业余观鸟爱好者 可以把自己的观察结果上传，
And then, ornithologists can go and help track populations, migrations, etc.	之后鸟类学家可以从中 追踪数量，迁徙情况等。
And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.	有个叫 迈克 奥特斯的人，他住在英国，
He's a director of an electroplating company.	他是一家电镀公司的总监。
He's found more than 140 comets.	他发现了超过140个彗星。
He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.	他发现了如此之多的彗星，有一颗彗星就以他命名。
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.	那些彗星比火星还远，是一个长途旅行。
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.	我不认为他拍过什么照片。
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.	他发现的140颗彗星，并没有用望远镜，
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite, and that's how he found them.	而是从 NASA SOHO卫星下载数据 分析出来的。
If we can find comets without a telescope, shouldn't we be able to find words?	如果我们可以不用望远镜就能发现彗星， 为什么我们就不能发现单词呢？
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.	现在你明白我的立场了。
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.	我要去互联网，就像大伙那样。
And the Internet is great for collecting words, because the Internet's full of collectors.	互联网非常合适搜集单词， 因为互联网上有很多搜集者。
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet, but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.	这是一个关于互联网的不为人知的技术事实， 互联网实际上是由单词和热情组成的。
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography.	而单词和热情正好是 字典编纂的膳料。
Isn't that great?	那不是很好吗？
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now, but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.	现在已经有很多单词搜集网站了， 只是它们中有些还不够科学，
They show the word, but they don't show any context.	有些显示了词，没有显示上下文，
Where did it come from?	词从哪里来？
Who said it?	谁说的？
What newspaper was it in?	源自哪张报纸？
What book?	哪本书？
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.	因为一个词就像一个考古学产物，
If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact, it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.	如果你不知道起源或源头， 这就不够科学——这是应该去考究的。
So a word without its source is like a cut flower.	一个没有来源的词就像一朵被剪下来的花。
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.	看一会还可以，不久就蔫了。
It dies too fast.	蔫得太快了。
So, this whole time I've been saying, "The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."	我一直在说， 字典，字典， 字典，字典。
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because, well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.	而不是一本字典，或很多字典，这是因为， 人们用字典去代表整个语言。
They use it synecdochically.	这是一种借代的说法——
And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically" is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."	知道synecdochically会引起的问题是 你真的很想找个理由去说synecdochically
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.	这整个演讲也就是个借口，为了能让我可以有机会 跟你们说 synecdochically这个词。
So I'm really sorry.	真对不起。
But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language, or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country -- then you're using it synecdochically.	但如果你用一样事物的一部分， 例如字典是语言的一部分， 或者用国旗代表美国作为一个国家的象征—— 那样你在用借代。
But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.	不过，我们可以让字典成为语言的全部，
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.	如果我们有个大一点的锅，那我们就可以把所有的单词都放里边了，
We can put in all the meanings.	还可以把所有的单词解释都放里边。
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?	每个人不都想人生更有意义吗（英语里，意义和单词解释是同一个单词）？
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language.	那样，我们就可以让字典不仅仅是语言的象征， 我们就可以让字典涵盖整个语言。
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son, who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.	你看，我真希望到我儿子的时候—— 这个月他就满7岁了——我想他只记得 这是过去的字典的形式，
This is what dictionaries used to look like.	这是过去的字典的样子。
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.	我想他把这种字典当成8轨录音带类似的东西，
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.	是种已经过时的形式，
It wasn't really what people needed.	不再适合人们的需求。
And the thing is, if we can put in all the words, no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad, we can really describe the language like scientists.	如果我们可以涵盖所有单词， 不再人为的区分好词坏词， 我们就可以像科学家那样的描述语言，
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.	我们可以把审美判断留给作家和演讲者。
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing, and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.	如果我们可以做到这点，那我就可以把我所有的时间花在捕鱼上， 用不着再当交警。
Thank you very much for your kind attention.	谢谢，感谢您的关注。
I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials.	我想我应该谈一谈自然是如何制造材料的。
I brought along with me an abalone shell.	我带来了一个鲍鱼壳。
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein.	这个鲍鱼壳是种生物复合材料， 其中百分之98是碳酸钙 百分之二是蛋白质。
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart.	然而，它比地质学中相对应的 物质要坚硬三千倍。
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells, like chalk.	许多人或许用过类似鲍鱼壳这样的结构， 如粉笔。
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials, and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job.	如今我为自然创造材料的方法所深深着迷， 做到这样的精细活 要经过一系列的过程。
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure, but they're formed at the nanoscale.	这些材料在结构上 肉眼可见， 但是它们是由纳米级材料组成的。
They're formed at the nanoscale, and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures.	它们是由纳米级材料组成的， 它们使用由基因层次控制的蛋白质， 这使得它们能构建非常精致的结构。
So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures, like batteries and like solar cells?	因此，我觉得非常让人着迷的是 如果能赋予非生物结构 以生命会发生什么， 比如电池，比如太阳能电池？
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did, in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure, using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment?	如果它们能有一些鲍鱼壳所拥有的 同样的能力会怎样， 能够 在常温常压下 用无毒的化学物质， 不添加对环境有害的材料 构建精致的结构。
So that's the vision that I've been thinking about.	这就是我曾想到过的愿景。
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?	那么，如果你能在皮氏培养皿中培养出电池将会怎样？
Or, what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so in an environmentally friendly way?	或者说，如果你能把基因信息赋予一个电池， 以便确实能在一定时间内 变得更好， 并以一种环境友好的方式进行时会怎样？
And so, going back to this abalone shell, besides being nano-structured, one thing that's fascinating, is when a male and a female abalone get together, they pass on the genetic information that says, "This is how to build an exquisite material.	回到这个鲍鱼壳， 除了存在纳米结构之外， 令人着迷的一件事是， 当一只雄性鲍鱼和磁性鲍鱼相遇， 他们相互传递基因信息 信息中表明，这是如何构建一个精巧的材料。
Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure, using non-toxic materials."	这就是如何在常温常压下，用无毒材料 做到这些的。
Same with diatoms, which are shown right here, which are glasseous structures.	与硅藻相同，有着光泽，有着玻璃状结构。
Every time the diatoms replicate, they give the genetic information that says, "Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano-structured.	每次硅藻复制时， 它们给出基因信息，其中表明， 这就是如何在海洋中 有完美纳米结构的玻璃。
And you can do it the same, over and over again."	你能同样进行，并不断重复。
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery?	那么如果你能用太阳能电池或 电池做同样的事会怎样？
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old.	我想说我最喜欢的生物材料是我四岁的孩子。
But anyone who's ever had, or knows, small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms.	但任何曾有过或了解小孩的人 都知道他们是多么复杂的生物体。
And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do, it's very difficult.	因此，说服他们去 做他们不想做的事，非常困难。
So when we think about future technologies, we actually think of using bacteria and virus, simple organisms.	当我们思考未来科技时， 我们会想到细菌和病毒的应用， 简单的有机体。
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me?	你能让它们使用新的工具箱吗， 以使它们能构建一种 对我来说很重要的结构么？
Also, when we think about future technologies, we start with the beginning of Earth.	同样地，我们对未来科技进行思考。 我们从地球最初开始，
Basically, it took a billion years to have life on Earth.	基本上，用了十亿年 地球上才开始出现生命。
And very rapidly, they became multi-cellular, they could replicate, they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source.	接着很快地就进化成了多细胞生命， 它们能够复制自己，能用光合作用 作为获取能源的一种方式。
But it wasn't until about 500 million years ago -- during the Cambrian geologic time period -- that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials.	但知道500万年前 -- 在寒武纪地质时代 -- 海洋中的生物开始制造坚硬的材料。
Before that, they were all soft, fluffy structures.	之前它们制造的都是柔软蓬松的结构。
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment, and organisms learned how to make hard materials.	正是在这一时期内 环境中的钙、铁 硅的含量增加了。 生物学会了如何制作坚硬的材料。
And so that's what I would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.	所以我希望能够 -- 确定生物 能与周期表中的其他元素工作。
Now if you look at biology, there's many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you've heard about that are already nano-structured.	现在，如果查看一下生物， 有许多类似DNA、抗体、 蛋白质和核糖体这样你曾听说过的结构， 这些结构以及是纳米结构了。
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale.	因此自然已经给予了我们 纳米级的非常精巧的结构。
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV?	如果我们控制它们 让他们不要变成像艾滋病病毒 这样的抗体将会怎样？
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?	但如果我们能让它们为我们 建造太阳能电池将会怎样？
So here are some examples: these are some natural shells.	这儿有些例子：这是些天然的贝壳。
There are natural biological materials.	它们是天然的生物材料。
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nano-structured.	这个是鲍鱼壳 -- 如果折断它， 会看到它是纳米结构。
There's diatoms made out of SIO2, and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation.	硅藻是由二氧化硅组成， 他们是趋磁细菌， 它们用微小的单极磁体导航。
What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale, and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures.	这些事物的共同之处是 这些材料的结构都是纳米级的， 它们拥有一个DNA序列 这是一个蛋白质序列编码， 这给了它们一个蓝图 使它们能够构建这些奇妙的结构。
Now, going back to the abalone shell, the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins.	现在，回到鲍鱼壳， 鲍鱼用这些蛋白质做成壳。
These proteins are very negatively charged.	这些蛋白质带有负电荷。
And they can pull calcium out of the environment, put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.	它们能吸收环境中的钙， 放上一层钙，然后是一层碳酸盐，再一层钙一层碳酸盐。
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids, which says, "This is how to build the structure.	这是氨基酸的化学序列 其中表明，这就是如何构建这种结构。
Here's the DNA sequence, here's the protein sequence in order to do it."	这是要做到这点的DNA序列， 蛋白质序列。
And so an interesting idea is, what if you could take any material that you wanted, or any element on the periodic table, and find its corresponding DNA sequence, then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure, but not build an abalone shell -- build something that, through nature, it has never had the opportunity to work with yet.	一个有意思的想法是，如果你能选择任何材料或是 周期表中的任何元素， 依照DNA序列， 然后依照蛋白质序列 建立结构，但不是构建一个鲍鱼壳，将会怎样 -- 通过自然构建某种事物， 这是从未有机会进行的尝试。
And so here's the periodic table.	这是周期表。
And I absolutely love the periodic table.	我非常喜欢周期表。
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT, I have a periodic table made that says, "Welcome to MIT.	在MIT，大一新生来的第一课， 我都会提供一个周期表， 欢迎来到MIT。
Now you're in your element."	现在你进入你的元素了。
And you flip it over, and it's the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges.	把它翻过来，是带有PH值的氨基酸 不同的PH值下带有不同的电荷。
And so I give this out to thousands of people.	我把这个发给了数以千计的人。
And I know it says MIT, and this is Caltech, but I have a couple extra if people want it.	我知道这上面写了MIT，写了加州理工， 但如果有人要的话我还有些额外的。
And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT, and I really wanted to give him a periodic table.	我非常荣幸的是， 奥巴马总统今年访问MIT时 造访了我的实验室， 我很想给他一张周期表。
So I stayed up at night, and I talked to my husband, "How do I give President Obama a periodic table?	我熬夜思索，对我的丈夫说 我怎么才能给奥巴马总统一张周期表呢？
What if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,' or, 'I've already memorized it'?"	如果他说，哦，我已经有一张了 或是我已经背下来了该怎么办？
And so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit.	因此他到访我的实验室 四处浏览 -- 这是个很棒的访问。
And then afterward, I said, "Sir, I want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight."	后来，我说， 先生，我想给你张周期表 以备你陷入困境，需要计算分子量时使用。
And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass.	我觉得分子量听起来不像摩尔质量 那么呆板。
And so he looked at it, and he said, "Thank you.	他看了看它， 说到， 谢谢。
I'll look at it periodically."	我会定期看看它的。
And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy, he pulled it out and said, "And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables."	之后在一次关于清洁能源的演讲中， 他把它拿出来，说道， 在MIT时有人给了我周期表。
So basically what I didn't tell you is that about 500 million years ago, organisms starter making materials, but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it.	所以基本上我没有告诉各位的是 大约五亿年前，生物就开始制造材料， 大概花了五千万年变得擅长于此。
It took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell.	花了五千万年时间 学会了完美地制造出鲍鱼壳。
And that's a hard sell to a graduate student.	这对研究生来说很难理解
"I have this great project -- 50 million years."	我拥有这个伟大的项目 -- 五千万年。
And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly.	因此我们不得不找出一种 更快速的方式来完成这些。
And so we use a virus that's a non-toxic virus called M13 bacteriophage that's job is to infect bacteria.	因此我们使用了一种病毒， 一种名为M13噬菌体的无毒病毒， 用它去感染细菌。
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it.	它有简单的DNA结构， 可以剪切、粘贴 附加的DNA序列到其中。
And by doing that, it allows the virus to express random protein sequences.	这样做后，它允许病毒 表达随机的蛋白质序列。
And this is pretty easy biotechnology.	这是很简单的生物技术。
And you could basically do this a billion times.	可以这么做个十亿次。
And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical, but they differ from each other based on their tips, on one sequence that codes for one protein.	这样就能得到十亿个不同的病毒 它们具有相同的遗传基因， 但它们可以基于它们的标签相互区分， 为一个蛋白质 编码的序列。
Now if you take all billion viruses, and you can put them in one drop of liquid, you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table.	现在，收集起所有这些病毒， 可以把它们放入一滴液体中， 可以强制它们与周期表中的任何元素交互。
And through a process of selection evolution, you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you'd like it to do, like grow a battery or grow a solar cell.	通过一个选择性进化的过程， 可以从十亿中选出一个符合你期望的病毒， 比如长出一个电池或是一个太阳能电池。
So basically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.	所以，基本上，病毒不能复制自身，它们需要宿主。
Once you find that one out of a billion, you infect it into a bacteria, and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence.	一旦有亿万中的一个 感染了一个细菌， 就会产生不计其数的那种 特定序列的复制体。
And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales.	生物学的另一个美妙之处是 生物学可以以一种良好的比例 呈现精致的结构。
And these viruses are long and skinny, and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries.	这些病毒长且瘦， 我们能让它们表达生长出一些事物的能力 比如半导体 或是制作电池的材料。
Now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab.	这是我们在实验室培育的高能电池。
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.	我们让病毒收集碳纳米管。
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube.	病毒的一部分抓住一个碳纳米管。
The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery.	另一部分拥有一个 能长出电池的电极材料的序列。
And then it wires itself to the current collector.	然后它把自己缠绕成集电器。
And so through a process of selection evolution, we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature, basically at the bench top.	然后通过一个选择性进化的过程， 我们就从一个制造低劣电池的病毒 得到了一个制造良好电池的病毒 一个制造破纪录的高能电池的病毒 这些都是在常温下，实验台上进行的。
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference.	那个电池去白宫参加过一次记者招待会。
I brought it here.	我把它带到这里来了。
You can see it in this case -- that's lighting this LED.	各位能在这个盒子里看到它 -- 亮着的是个LED等。
Now if we could scale this, you could actually use it to run your Prius, which is my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car.	如果我们能放大这个， 就能用它来 驱动普瑞斯车， 这是我的梦想 -- 能驾驶一辆病毒驱动的汽车。
But it's basically -- you can pull one out of a billion.	但基本上 -- 能从十亿中选出一个。
You can make lots of amplifications to it.	能把它放大许多倍。
Basically, you make an amplification in the lab, and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery.	基本上，能在实验室进行放大。 然后让它自组装 成一个如电池这样的结构。
We're able to do this also with catalysis.	我们也能通过催化作用做到这些。
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water.	这是光触媒 分离水的例子。
And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna, and you get an energy transfer across the virus.	我们已经能做到的是 设计一个病毒，能吸收染色分子 并把染色分子在病毒的表面排成一列， 就像个触须， 然后就能让能量转移穿过这些病毒了。
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels.	接着我们给它第二段基因 以生长出无机材料 这能用于把水分离成 氢气和氧气， 氢气和氧气能用作清洁燃料。
And I brought an example with me of that today.	今天我带来了一个样本。
My students promised me it would work.	我的学生对我保证说它能运作。
These are virus-assembled nanowires.	这些是由病毒组装的纳米线。
When you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling.	当用光照向它们时，能看到他们在冒着泡泡。
In this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out.	这样的情况表明，所看到的是氧气正在冒出。
And basically, by controlling the genes, you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance.	基本上通过控制基因 就能够控制多种材料来改进设备性能。
The last example are solar cells.	最后一个例子是太阳能电池。
You can also do this with solar cells.	也可以这样制造太阳能电池。
We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device.	我们已经能够设计病毒 来收集碳纳米管 然后再外面附着上二氧化钛 -- 并作为通过设备收集电子的一种方式。
And what we've found is through genetic engineering, we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems.	我们的发现是，通过基因工程 我们能真正的增加 这些太阳能电池的效率 为各种类型的 染色敏化系统记录数字。
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward.	我也带了一个到这儿来 稍后各位可以在外面摆弄一下。
So this is a virus-based solar cell.	这是个基于病毒的太阳能电池。
Through evolution and selection, we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.	通过进化和选择， 我们把这个太阳能电池由效能百分之八 变为了百分之十一。
So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great, interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force, or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials, to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making.	我希望我已经让各位相信 关于如何让自然制作材料 有许多美好的、有趣的事情要学习-- 更进一步 看看能否你能够推行， 或是利用自然制作材料的方式 来制作一些自然还未被要求制作的东西。
Thank you.	谢谢。
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.	大约15年前，我去香港拜访一位朋友。
And at the time I was very superstitious.	那个时候我很迷信。
So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city -- I thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks.	所以，在飞机降落之前--那还是在香港的旧机场， 那是Kai Tak,它当时正好在市中心-- 我当时想：如果我现在看见一些好的东西，那么我将会在香港的这2周过的十分快乐。
And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."	 如果我看见一些不好的东西，那么我将会过的十分悲痛沮丧。
So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.	之后飞机降落在一些楼的中间， 并停在了这个小广告牌的前面。
And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there.	笑声（WINNER：胜利者） 实际上，我当时是去参观一些香港的 设计公司。
And it turned out that -- I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.	但结果却是-- 我本来只是想去看看他们在香港正在做什么设计项目。
But I actually walked away with a great job offer.	但是我却轻易的获得了一个很好的工作机会。
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.	之后我飞回奥地利并收拾我的行装。 一个星期后，我又踏上了飞往香港的旅程， 我仍然迷信的想：好的，如果那块Winner(胜利）的广告牌还竖在那里的话， 我将会在这里工作的很开心。
But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."	笑声 但是如果它不在那里的话，我在香港的时间将会很不幸，很痛苦。
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it.	但结果是，不仅那块广告牌还竖在那里， 有人还将这块牌子放在了它的旁边。
On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.	笑声 另一方面，它也让我明白了迷信不可信， 因为之后我在香港真的过很糟糕。
However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life -- of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to as "moments that take your breath away."	笑声 但是，在生活中我确实有过一些真正的快乐时刻-- 就像你们知道的，这个会议宣传册上所提到的， 那种带走你呼吸的美好时刻。
And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.	由于我是一个喜欢列表单的人，所以我将他们都列举出来了。
Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you.	笑声 现在，大家并不需要担心去阅读这些条款， 我也不会在这里将他们一一念出来。
I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.	我知道听别人的欢乐幸福故事是一件令人难以置信乏味的事情。
What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.	笑声 但是，我要做的就是从设计的角度去看待他们 并且将一切与设计无关的条款都移除。
And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.	之后我非常惊奇地发现，实际上有多过一半的条款都与设计有些关系。
So there are, of course, two different possibilities.	所以，这有两种可能性。
There's one from a consumer's point of view -- where I was happy while experiencing design.	一种是从消费者的角度看-- --即当我体验设计时的快乐。
And I'll just give you one example.	我可以举一个例子。
I had gotten my first Walkman.	我得到我的第一个随声听，
This is 1983.	那是在1983年。
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely.	这是我兄弟当时的雅马哈摩托车， 并且他很乐意随时将它借给我。
And The Police's "Synchronicity" cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.	这是那时候The Police发行的名为同步的 专辑磁带。 在我的家乡Bregenz没有规定骑摩托车要带头盔的法律。
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.	所以你可以骑到山上， 自由大声地用新索尼随身听播放Police的音乐。
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.	笑声 我记得那是我真正的快乐时刻。
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects.	当然，这种快乐与他们中的至少这两种东西的同时存在的的结合有关， 即两种有设计的产品。
And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know, situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss.	并且你知道，当我们谈论设计的时候是有一个关于快乐的衡量标准比例的， 但是对于摩托车这种小事将会 位于愉快与极乐之间。
Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint -- if you're happy while actually doing it.	现在，还有另外一部分，从设计师的角度看-- 当你做设计的时候，你是否快乐。
And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?	也许有一种方法可以看到设计师们在从事设计的时候到底有多高兴-- 看他们专著封底的作者照片。
So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy.	笑声 所以，据此，奥地利以及日本 还有墨西哥的设计师们 都非常快乐。
While, somewhat, the Spaniards ...	笑声 然而，西班牙的设计师们有点，
and, I think, particularly, the Swiss , don't seem to be doing all that well.	我看，尤其是瑞士的设计师们， 笑声 并不是那么快乐。
Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum, in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.	笑声 去年十一月，有一个博物馆在东京开放，名为Mori博物馆， 它在一栋摩天楼的第56层。
And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."	他们的首次展览名为快乐。
And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because -- well, also, with an eye on this conference.	那么我就带着非常渴望的心情去参观，因为， 当然此行的目的也着眼于此次会议。
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.	有趣的是，他们将展览分为了四个不同的区域。
Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period -- a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.	在阿卡迪亚展区，他们展出了类似这样的作品，来自于日本江户时期-- --用一百种不同的造型书写快乐的方法。
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.	他们还展示了Yoko Ono 的苹果--当然，之后 你知道，他成为了披头士的标签。
Under "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.	在天堂展区，他们展示了Constable的绘画。
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.	关于抽象有一个小而有趣的理论。
This is a blue field -- it's actually an Yves Klein painting.	这是一块蓝色的区域--它实际上是Yves Kline的绘画。
And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know open as much room for the un-representable -- and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.	这个理论就是，如果你将一个图像抽象化，那么你可以， 为这种非代表性打开许多空间-- --因此，可以使观众更多的参与进来。
Then, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings -- also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.	在欲望的展区，他们展示了这些Shunsho的绘画-- --同样来自于日本江户时代--油墨印在丝绸上。
And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.	最后，在和谐的展厅内，他们展示了这个十三世纪的来自于西藏的曼陀罗。
Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness.	那么，我从这个展览中得到的是， 除了曼陀罗这个特例以外， 展览中的大部分作品实际上都只是给人视觉上的快乐 而不是内心的快乐。
And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization -- that's a really easy thing to do.	并且我觉得有点被欺骗的感觉，因为视觉化-- --那真的是很容易做到的事情。
And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.	并且你知道，我的设计工作室--我们一直致力于这方面的工作。
This is, you know, a book.	这是一本书。
A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.	一条快乐的狗--当你把外壳去掉，这是一条凶狠的狗。
It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.	这是快乐的David Byrne 和愤怒的David Byrne 。
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.	或是一张有着笑脸的爵士乐海报，以及面部好斗的表情。
You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.	你知道，达到这些并没有什么大不了的。
It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view.	在广告行业界，有一种说法， 或者在电影界，就是快乐拥有一个非常不好的声誉，以至于 如果你真的想做与这个主题有关的一些事情 并且是原创的话，那你将不得不 从愤世嫉俗的观点角度切入。
This is, you know, the movie poster.	这是一个电影海报。
Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.	这是我们在几周前，为说话的头设计的包装， 当然快乐的概念在封面上得到了视觉化的体现，
Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness -- and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.	更加困难的是，如何让设计激起人们的快乐， 我将展示三个真正激起我快乐的设计。
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True."	这是一个由一位年轻的纽约设计师领导的设计项目，他将自己称为真实。
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs?	每个曾经做过纽约地铁的人应该 都对这些标识很熟悉吧？
True printed his own version of these signs.	真实设计并印刷出自己的标识版本。
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.	每周三他都会和他的20个朋友在一个地铁站会面。
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.	他们分成不同的小组，将他们的标识版本添加在不同的地铁线路上。
So this is one.	笑声 这是一个。
Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.	笑声 实际上并没有人会去看原来的这些标识系统。
So you're you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.	所以 笑声 当你十分无聊的在坐地铁的时候，你会盯着某些东西看，
And it takes you a while until it actually -- you realize that this says something different than what it normally says.	然后你花了一定时间直到你意识到-- 这些标识和以前正常的标识表达的内容并不一样。
I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.	笑声 我意思是，这至少让我快乐。
Now, True is a real humanitarian.	笑声 真实是一个真的人道主义者。
He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested, so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.	他那时也不想朋友们被逮住， 所以他给每位朋友制作了这个假造的志愿者卡片，
And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody -- sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.	笑声 并且给了他们每个人这封假造的，来自于MAT的信-- --使其看起来有点像是一个由 地铁部门资助的一个艺术项目。
Another New York project.	笑声 另一个来自纽约的项目。

There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.	当然，除了我现在展示的这三张投影图片之外，还有许多其他的天空光影的效果。
I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud" a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.	我可以确定的说，几年前在麦哈顿观察Vik Muniz设计的云项目 确实同样让我感到高兴。
But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.	我要展示的最后一个项目，是由一位年轻的纽约设计师所做，
He's from Korea originally.	他其实是韩国人。
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.	他主动印了55，000个卡通造型的语言留言板-- --空的卡通留言贴，有大型号的和小型号的。

And other people go and fill them in.	笑声 其他人走过并填写这些空的留言贴。

I think that was -- the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.	笑声 我想这个是-- 让我最吃惊的是，这些文字都很漂亮
This is on a musician poster, that says: "I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units and that, as a result, my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me, after which, my contract will be cancelled, and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."	这是在一个音乐海报上面的留言，写着： 我担心我的CD将不会卖到超过200，000张， 那么结果将是，我将不会再有自己的 唱片。 在这之后，我的合约将会被取消， 之后我将会回到Bleecker街翻唱别人的歌。
I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.	笑声 我想这个项目可以达到使人快乐的原因是每个人都获得了一些东西。
Jee gets to have his project; the public gets a sweeter environment; and different public gets a place to express itself; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.	Jee做了这个项目； 公众获得了一个更亲切的环境； 以及不同的人获得了一个可以表达他们自己的地方； 并且登广告的人最终获得了一些人去关注他们的广告。
Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while: You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?	笑声 当然，在我的思想中有个问题存在了一段时间： 你知道，我可以在设计中做更多我想做的事， 做更少我不想做的事吗？
Which brought me back to my list making -- you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.	这个问题又将我带回了我的这张列表-- --去看看到底我喜欢我工作的那些方面。
You know, one is: just working without pressure.	其中之一就是：可以没有压力的去工作。

And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?	并且就在那时，一个奥地利的杂志社联系我并问我 是否愿意设计六张杂志广告--设计六张 可以将杂志内不同章节分开的杂志广告？
And the whole thing just fell together.	这个正好与我的想法走到一起了。
So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned -- in this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" -- and we made these spreads right out of this.	所以我在其中挑选了一条我认为我已经学到了的东西-- 那就是，我常常想起我做的每件事情-- --并且我们的这个设计就源于此。

So, people want a lot of things out of life, but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.	众所周知，人类为了各种各样的理想而奋斗， 但是我认为，归根究底，他们要的是幸福。
Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end towards which all other things aim.	亚里士多德把称幸福为至高无上的精神享受， 所有奋斗和追求的终极目标。
According to this view, the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.	根据这个观点，我们之所以渴望一间大房子 或者一辆豪车 或者一个好工作 本质上来说，并不是因为这些东西对我们特别有价值。
It's that we expect them to bring us happiness.	而是因为我们期待这些财富能给我们带来 幸福。
Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want.	在过去的50年里，我们美国人的物质生活 达到了前所未有的高度。
We're richer.	我们更富有了。
We live longer.	平均寿命更长了。
We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.	廉价而又实用的科技产品 使我们的生活看起来犹如科幻小说一般 仅仅是几年的功夫。
The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically, we haven't actually gotten any happier.	但是令人费解的是，虽然 客观上我们的物质生活水平有了极大的提高， 我们的幸福感却一点也没增加，
Maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness, there's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself.	也许是因为这些传统意义上能增加幸福感的方法 其实对幸福感并没有什么大的影响， 近些年来越来越多的人对 幸福本身产生了浓厚的兴趣。
People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years, but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.	很长一段时间，大家都在争论到底是什么带给人类 幸福感，事实上这场争论已经持续了数千年之久， 但是看起来这些争论都没有令人信服的结果。
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.	恩，如同生活中很多领域一样，我认为 科学研究是可以来回答这个问题的。
In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion in research on happiness.	其实，在过去的数年里，对于幸福的研究 有了一些突破性的进展。
For example, we've learned a lot about its demographics, how things like income and education, gender and marriage relate to it.	比如，我们通过对 人口统计学的研究了解到，外界因素诸如收入 和教育，性别与婚姻状况对幸福感有一定的影响。
But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.	但是令人觉得矛盾的是 上面提过的这些都不是决定性的因素。
Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less, or to graduate from college instead of dropping out, but the differences in happiness tend to be small.	的确，多挣些钱是件好事， 大学毕业肯定比中途辍学好很多， 但是这些对幸福感的影响都微乎其微。
Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?	这不禁让我们陷入思考中，什么才是幸福感的决定性因素呢？
I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet, but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.	我觉得这个问题我们还没有百分之百肯定的答案， 但是我认为我们已经找到一种很可能是答案的观点 就是 也许幸福感是取决于 生活中各式各样的瞬间感受。
It certainly seems that we're going about our lives, that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about, have a big influence on our happiness, and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult, in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.	这就好像我们正面对的日常生活中， 我们正在做的事情，我们和谁在一起，我们正在考虑什么， 对我们的幸福指数有很大的影响，不仅如此 还有很多因素他们很难， 事实上几乎是不可能，作为研究的素材。
A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never been able to do before.	几年前，我找到一种研究幸福感的方法 随时随地进行研究在人们日常生活中 并在全世界范围内开展，这些我们曾经 想都不敢想的事。
Called trackyourhappiness.org, it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.	我们把它命名为 trackyourhappiness.org(网址） 它能通过Iphone实时监测大家的幸福指数。
How does this work?	它的工作原理是什么呢？
Basically, I send people signals at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal.	基本上，我会联系他们 在一个随机的时间，随后我会问他们 一些问题关于他们的即时感受 在我联系他们之前的那一瞬间。
The idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day, minute to minute in some cases, and try to understand how what people are doing, who they're with, what they're thinking about, and all the other factors that describe our day, how those might relate to those changes in happiness, we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness.	这么做的原因是，如果我们可以观察到他们的幸福指数 上升或者下降伴随着这一天的进行， 有些案例是每分钟联系一次， 并且尽量找出大家在做什么 他们和谁在一起，他们在想什么，和其它 所有能描述我们生活的因素，这些因素是如何 跟幸福指数联系在一起的，我们也许能通过它 去发现那些真正能 对幸福感产生重大影响的东西。
We've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before, over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people.	我们很幸运的通过这个途径 收集到了大量的资料，比我预期的还要多的资料 前所未有的多， 超过65万的即时信息 来自超过1万5千名志愿者。
And it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group, people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s, a wide range of incomes, education levels, people who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.	不但人数众多，而且分布广泛， 志愿者分布在不同的年龄层，从18岁到80岁， 不同的收入阶层，教育层次， 已婚的，离婚的，丧偶的，等等。
They collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.	这些志愿者出在 86个不同行业并且来自超过80个国家。
What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating, and that's mind-wandering.	在今天剩下的时间里我要做的是 和大家探讨一下其中一部分我们已经 研究了一段时间的东西，那就是走神。
As human beings, we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present.	作为人类，我们有这种独一无二的能力 把我们的注意力从眼前的事物转移到别处。
This guy is sitting here working on his computer, and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month, wondering what he's going to have for dinner.	这个人正坐在电脑前工作， 但是他可能正在回味 上个月的旅行， 考虑一会去哪儿吃晚饭。
Maybe he's worried that he's going bald.	可能他正在担心自己快要秃了。
This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing.	这个能力使我们能让我们把更多注意力转移到其它地方 而不是当下正在做的事 这实在是太惊人了。
It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.	这个能力让人类 以自己独有的方式学习，设计和理解。
And yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness.	至今我们还是不能确定使用这种能力 和我们的幸福感有什么关系。
You've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present.	你肯定曾经听到别人建议你 做事情要专心致志。
"Be here now," you've probably heard a hundred times.	不要走神， 你肯定听得耳朵都长茧了。
Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.	也许，想要幸福，我们应该沉浸 并且专注在我们曾经经历过的美好瞬间。
Maybe these people are right.	也许这些人是对的。
Maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing.	也许走神 不是件好事。
On the other hand, when our minds wander, they're unconstrained.	但另一方面，走神可以让 我们的思想无拘无束。
We can't change the physical reality in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.	我们不能改变在我们 面前的现实世界，但是我们的思想却可以飞到任何地方。
Since we know people want to be happy, maybe when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving.	我们知道人类渴望得到幸福，也许 当我们走神时，思想正飞往比眼前 更幸福的地方。
It would make a lot of sense.	这样就说得通了。
In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.	换句话说，也许思想中的愉悦 通过走神提高了我们的幸福感。
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness.	好吧，作为一个科学工作者，我希望尽量 用数据来解决这个争论，所以我会特别想 展示一些数据给大家。
Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.	请记住，这些都来自 人们日常生活中的瞬间感受。
There are three questions.	这里有三个问题。
The first one is a happiness question: How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad to very good?	第一个问题关于快乐： 你心情怎么样，衡量标准从非常差 到非常好？
Second, an activity question: What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV?	第二个问题，关于行为： 你在干嘛，我们的清单上记录了22中不同的活动 包括吃饭，工作和看电视？
And finally a mind-wandering question: Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing?	和一个关于 走神的问题： 你在想些别的事吗 而不是专心在眼下正在做的这件？
People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task -- or yes -- I am thinking about something else -- and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant, neutral or unpleasant.	有人会回答 没有--或者换个说法，我正专注在我的工作上-- 有人会说 是的--我正在想些别的事-- 这些事可能是高兴的， 平淡无奇的或者不高兴的。
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.	这些事就是我们所谓的走神了。
So what did we find?	所以我们发现什么了什么？
This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis, and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present, when they're not mind-wandering.	这些柱状图为我们描述了各种状态下的幸福指数， 大家可以看到 眼前这个柱状图代表了 人们集中精神在当下时的幸福指数， 当他们没有走神的时候。
As it turns out, people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not.	事实证明，人们的幸福指数明显降低了 当他们走神的时候相对于没走神时。
Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure, on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering, but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with, at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.	现在看着眼前的结果大家可能会说，好吧，一定是这样， 普遍情况下人们在走神的状态下会觉得不幸福， 但是很有可能当人们的注意力从 一些令人不爽的事情上转移到其它地方时， 至少这个时候走神能让我们觉得快乐一点。
Nope.	不是的。
As it turns out, people are less happy when they're mind-wandering no matter what they're doing.	事实证明， 人们并不会因为走神而变得更幸福 无论他们正在干嘛。
For example, people don't really like commuting to work very much.	例如， 所有人都很不喜欢每日通勤这档子事。
It's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else.	它是公认的最令人不愉快的活动,即便如此 当人们只把注意力放在赶路上的时候 依然会感觉比走神到其它事情上 更快乐一点。
It's amazing.	太让人吃惊了。
So how could this be happening?	是什么导致了这样的结果呢？
I think part of the reason, a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things, and they are enormously less happy when they do that, our worries, our anxieties, our regrets, and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral, they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind-wandering at all.	我认为部分原因是， 很大程度上吧，是因为当我们走神的时候， 我们经常会想起一些不太愉快的事情，这些事情比 眼下正在做的事情悲惨多了， 我们的担心，忧虑，心中的悔恨， 即便是当人们正在想一些 平淡无奇的事情，人们的幸福指数依然低于 集中精神的时候。
Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant, they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind-wandering.	甚至当人们想着那些令人愉悦的事情时， 人们的幸福指数依然略低于 不走神的时候。
If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars or one dollar.	如果把走神看成一台老虎机，跟它赌只有三种结果 输50块，输20块 或者输一块钱。
Right?	对吧？
You'd never want to play.	你肯定不想玩它。
So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps, that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.	索然我已经说了很多关于幸福感的，建议，假设， 走神也许会降低我们的幸福感，但是 我真正想为大家展示的是 走神和幸福感两者是有关联的。
It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.	也许走神会降低幸福感，但是也有可能是另一种情况 人们因为觉得不幸福才走神。
Maybe that's what's really going on.	也许这才是真相。
How could we ever disentangle these two possibilites?	我们怎么才能 从这两种可能性中解脱出来？
Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not backward.	好吧，我们可以利用一个事实，我认为这个事实 大家都同意它的存在，这就是时间总是向前的，而不是 倒退的。
Right?	对吧？
The cause has to come before the effect.	原因一定出现在结果之前。
We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person, and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight into the causal direction.	我们很幸运的从大家那里搜集到这些数据， 据此我们可以观察并且找出，是走神 在痛苦之前出现，还是痛苦 在走神之前出现，通过这种以因果为导向 的方法。
As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later, consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.	事实证明，很多时候人们会觉得不快乐 当他们刚刚走神了以后， 这很符合我们对于走神会降低幸福指数的推测.
In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind-wandering a short time later.	相比之下，没有证据表明走神发生在 人们觉得不快乐之后。
In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.	换句话说，走神看起来很像是 是导致不幸福的真正原因，而不是结果，不幸福的后果。
A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play.	就在刚才，我把走神比喻成 一台无人问津的老虎机。
Well, how often do people's minds wander?	恩，人们走神的频率有多高呢？
Turns out, they wander a lot.	数据证明，走神的现象非常普遍。
In fact, really a lot.	事实上，简直是无时无刻。
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing.	47%的时间里，人们都在思考别的事情 而不是眼下正在做的。
How does that depend on what people are doing?	走神与否跟正在做的事情有什么关系呢？
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent — — when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth, to 50 percent when they're working, to 40 percent when they're exercising, all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at.	这里我们可以看到22种活动的走神比重 有的活动走神时间长达65%———— 当人们洗澡，或者刷牙的时候， 当人们在工作的时候50%的时间出在走神中， 当人们在运动的时候40%的时间出在走神中， 依次往下直到最短的这个柱状图 我相信很多人都会笑出来的。
Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex.	10%的时间在走神 当他们在做爱的时候。
But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph, and that is, basically with one exception, no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think, that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.	但是我认为这张图告诉了我们意见很有意思的事情， 这就是，基本上没有例外， 无论人们在做什么，他们都会走神 至少在30%的时间里走神，这告诉我们，我认为， 走神不仅仅频繁的出现，走神无处不在。
It pervades basically everything that we do.	走神遍布在所有的人类活动中。
In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering, a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness.	我们聊了这么多，我已经给大家讲了一些关于走神的观点， 一个已被明确证实得 存在于幸福方程式中的变量。
My hope is that over time, by tracking people's moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness, and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier, but happier as well.	我希望随着时间的过去，通过追踪人们的 即时幸福指数和他们的经历 在日常生活中，我们可以找出那些真正影响我们幸福感的因素， 最后，我相信科学并且系统的理解幸福 将会为我们创造一个更美好的未来 不仅仅是更富有 更健康，也更加幸福。

Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.	麻烦了，人太多了我都数不过来了
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction.	但是我估计，举手的人大概占60% 因为这差不多就是做过视力矫正的人 在发达国家的比例
The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people.	世界卫生组织评估过 他们通过不同的方式评估过需要戴眼镜的人数 最少也得有一亿五千万人
They also have an estimate of around a billion.	还有的估计是差不多10亿
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population.	但是事实上，我们在这里刚刚统计了一次 说明世界上有差不多一半的人 需要佩戴眼镜
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.	视力差，实际上不仅仅是个健康问题 它还是教育问题 经济问题，生活质量的问题
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.	眼镜不贵，也不紧缺
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world.	问题在于，没有足够的眼科方面的专业人士 会使用我们在发达国家中所用的 视力矫正器
There are just way too few eye care professionals.	眼科护理专家实在是太少了
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K.	幻灯片上表示的是一位验光师 一个蓝色小人代表大约一万人 这是在英国的比例
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.	这是在撒哈拉以南非洲中验光师占总人口的比例
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.	事实上，有一些撒哈拉以南非洲的国家 八百万人里只有一个验光师
How do you do this?	怎么办？
How do you solve this problem?	怎么解决这个问题？
I came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.	我有个办法 这个方法是基于自适应光学的
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem.	自己做眼镜，自己调整 这样问题就解决了
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.	我接下来给你们演示自己如何做副眼镜
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.	我来给你们演示一下，我把它放在口袋里
I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.	我近视，几乎看不到最后排的标志
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there, and I can see that guy running out there.	这样，好了，我能看见有个人跑出去了 我还能看见那边有个人跑出去了
I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.	我通过自己诊断，做了副处方眼镜
Next step in my process.	接下来要这么做
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.	我给自己诊断，做了副眼镜
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...	好，这个眼镜...
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...	...只要自己就行
... I've just ...	就快好了
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.	这就是我自己做的眼镜
Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.	这副眼镜不是独一无二的
In fact, this technology's been evolving.	事实上，这种技术一直在发展
I started working on it in 1985, and it's been evolving very slowly.	我从1985年开始从事这个工作 这项技术发展得非常缓慢
There are about 30,000 in use now.	现在世界上有大约三万人在使用
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.	他们分布在十五个国家，遍布全世界
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.	我有个梦想，想要跟大家分享
I have a global vision for vision.	一个关于视力的全球性的梦想
And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.	就是让十亿人 到2020年，能带上这种眼镜
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.	要实现这个梦想----这只是个早期演示品
The technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down.	现在技术已经大幅进步了 必须减小成本
This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.	这副眼镜，事实上，成本大约19美元
You start to get into detail.	这里我简要的介绍下可能遇到的各种问题
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.	怎么运输？
How do you work out how to fit the thing?	怎么让人们意识到他们有视力问题？
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?	怎么处理工业生产的问题？
How do you deal with the industry?	答案就是研究
And the answer to that is research.	我们已经建立了发展中国家视力中心 在这所大学里
What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university.	如果想进一步了解，请登录我们的网站。
Thank you.	请看这幅图。
Can you tell what it is?	 因此我已经看过了很多这类图片。
I'm a molecular biologist by training, and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.	他们通常被称作模型图片, 展示我们对细胞或分子过程 是如何进行的理解。
They're usually referred to as a model figure, a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs.	这幅图描述的是这样一个过程, 它叫网格蛋白介质的内吞。
This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.	该过程是指一个分子可以 从细胞外转运入细胞内。
It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell.	 转入的方式是通过先被捕捉进小泡或囊中, 随后被细胞内在化。
There's a problem with this drawing, though, and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.	但这幅图有一个问题, 这个问题主要是这幅图所没有表现的东西。
From lots of experiments, from lots of different scientists, we know a lot about what these molecules look like, how they move around in the cell, and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment.	从大量的实验中, 从大量不同的科学家身上, 我们对这些分子的样子, 它们是如何在细胞内移动的了解很多。 这些都发生在 一个不可思议的动态的环境中。
So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen, we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that.	因此，在与网格蛋白专家托马斯·科切豪斯合作中, 我们决定创造一个新的模型图片。 它可以展示所有的细节。
So we start outside of the cell.	于是我们从细胞外开始。
Now we're looking inside.	现在，我们看到的是内部。
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.	网格蛋白就是那些三条腿的分子。 它们可以自己组合成足球的形状。
Through connections with a membrane, clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle, that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell.	通过膜的相互连接, 网格蛋白可以使膜发生变形, 然后形成这种像杯子一样的形状 接着形成这种像小泡或小囊样的形状, 现在它正在捕捉一些 细胞外的蛋白质。
Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle, making it separate from the rest of the membrane, and now clathrin is basically done with its job, and so proteins are coming in now — we've covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage.	蛋白质正在进入，基本上掐断了小囊, 使得它从膜上分离开来。 现在，网格蛋白基本上已经完成了它的使命, 于是，蛋白质就进来了。 我们用黄色和橙色来标记它们。 它们负责将网格蛋白形成的笼子拆开,
And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again.	于是所有这些蛋白质基本上都可以循环, 重新加以利用。
These processes are too small to be seen directly, even with the best microscopes, so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis.	这些过程太小了以至于无法看到, 即使是用最好的显微镜, 因此，像这样的动画就提供了一个强大的工具 把一个假说可视化。
Here's another illustration, and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.	这是另一个例子, 这幅图展示了研究人员是如何猜想 艾滋病毒进入与离开细胞的。
And again, this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes.	同样，这是一个极大的简化, 而且还没开始显示, 我们对这些过程实际的了解。
You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses.	你可能会惊奇的发现, 这些简单的图画就是 绝大多数生物学家 可视化他们分子假说的唯一途径。
Why?	为什么？
Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard.	因为将我们认为实际上发生的过程 用电影的形式创作出来是非常困难的。
I spent months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software, and I spend months on each animation, and that's just time that most researchers can't afford.	我在好莱坞花了数个月学习三维动画软件。 每一个动画我都花了数月来制作。 这些时间对大多数研究员来说太长了。
The payoffs can be huge, though.	但是，回报也是巨大的。
Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.	分子动画是前所未有的。 它们能向广大的观众 传达大量精准的信息。
And I'm working on a new project now called "The Science of HIV" where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail.	我现在正从事一个新的项目, 它的名字叫艾滋病病毒的科学。 在这个项目中，我会尽可能准确地 将HIV病毒的整个生命周期用动画描绘出来， 所有的这些都会细致到分子级别。
The animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades, data on what this virus looks like, how it's able to infect cells in our body, and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection.	动画会取材于数千名科学家 在近几十年来收集的数据。 这些数据告诉我们这种病毒的形态, 它如何感染我们身体中的细胞, 以及如何对感染进行治疗。
Over the years, I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea, but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis.	多年以来，我发现动画 不仅仅便于交流思想, 它们同样在 探索假说上发挥作用。
Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study, and with the data we have now, that's just not good enough anymore.	许多生物学家仍使用笔和纸 来将他们研究的过程可视化, 使用的也是我们目前已有的数据, 但这远远不够。
The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas.	创作动画的过程 可以像催化剂一样，让研究人员 把想法清晰化，使之完善。
One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together, and in this way, animation can feed back into the research process.	我与一位研究员合作过, 她的研究方向是 神经变性疾病的分子机理 她提出一些与动画有直接相关的实验， 于是我和她齐心协力, 这样，动画就能反馈到研究过程中。
I believe that animation can change biology.	我相信动画能够改变生物学。
It can change the way that we communicate with one another, how we explore our data and how we teach our students.	它可以改变我们与他人的交流方式, 我们如何分析数据, 以及我们如何教育学生。
But for that change to happen, we need more researchers creating animations, and toward that end, I brought together a team of biologists, animators and programmers to create a new, free, open-source software — we call it Molecular Flipbook — that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations.	但要想这些改变发生, 我们需要更多的研究人员创作动画。 为实现这一目标，我召集了一支 由生物学家、动画师和程序员组成的团队。 开发了一款全新的、免费的、开源的软件。 它为生物学家而生, 专门用来创作分子动画。
From our testing, we've found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis.	测试显示，仅需要15分钟 一个从未接触动画软件的生物学家 就可以将她的假说猜想 创作成她的第一个分子动画。
We're also building an online database where anyone can view, download and contribute their own animations.	我们同时也建立了一个在线数据库, 任何人都可以查看、下载 以及上传他们自己的动画。
We're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today.	我们非常激动地宣布 这款分子动画制作软件的测试版 今天就可以下载了。
We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures.	看到生物学家用它来创作东西 以及他们从自己创作的动画中 得到的启示 我们为此感到激动不已。
Thank you.	谢谢。
I'm a filmmaker.	我是一个电影制片人
For the last 8 years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.	在过去的八年中 我全身心 投入到了 关于以色列人和巴勒斯坦人 用和平方式解决冲突的 纪录片拍摄中
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up: Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?	每当我为了工作了出差 无论在欧洲还是美国 我总碰到一个问题 巴勒斯坦的甘地在哪里
Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance?	为什么巴勒斯坦人 不采用非暴力抵抗
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers.	每当我听到这个问题就感到为难 因为这时 我往往才从中东工作回来 在那里 我的工作是 拍摄几十位巴勒斯坦人 他们通过非暴力的手段 保卫土地 和水资源 免受以色列士兵和定居者的剥夺
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region.	这些领导人正在努力 组织一场全国范围的大规模非暴力运动 来结束侵占 在这个地区建和平
Yet, most of you have probably never heard about them.	然而 大多数人 可能从来没有听说过他们
This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful.	真相与外界猜想 之间的隔阂 就是关键原因之一 解释为何 巴勒斯坦和平抵抗运动 尚未取得成功
So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention, the power of your attention, and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere -- but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.	我今天来 谈论的是关注的力量 你们的关注的力量 以及约旦河西岸 加沙地带和其它地方 非暴力运动的兴起和发展 而今天 我案例分析的主角是巴勒斯坦
I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence, but for us to start paying attention to those who already are.	我认为非暴力运动的成长 最欠缺的 并不是让巴勒斯坦人 开始进行非暴力运动 而是让我们开始关注 那些早已开始非暴力运动的人
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus.	请容我带领你们进入这个村庄 来解释这个道理 这个村庄叫布德鲁斯
About seven years ago, they faced extinction, because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier, and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village.	大约七年前 这里的人们面临着灭顶之灾 以色列宣布它将筑起一堵围墙 而其中一段 将跨过这个村庄
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded, so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank.	村民将失去40%的土地 并被包围起来 失去从这里进入 约旦河西岸地区的自由
Through inspired local leadership, they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening.	在当地领导人的激励下 他们发动了一场和平抵抗运动 以避免发生这样的结果
Let me show you some brief clips, so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground.	我给大家播放影片的一些片断 让你们大致了解 实地发生的情况
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel.	巴勒斯坦女子：他们说那堵围墙 会将巴勒斯坦和以色列分隔开来
Here in Budrus, we realized the wall would steal our land.	在布德鲁斯 我们意识到 那堵墙会抢占我们的土地
Israeli The fence has, in fact, created a solution to terror.	以色列男子：这堵围墙事实上 是防止恐怖行动的一项解决方法
Today you're invited to a peaceful march.	今天 我号召大家 加入一场和平的游行
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.	与你们并肩行动的 是几十位以色列兄弟姊妹
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition.	以色列行动主义者： 最令军队害怕的 就是非暴力抵抗
We saw the men trying to push the soldiers, but none of them could do that.	女子： 我们看到男人们 试图推开那些士兵 但是没有人成功
But I think the girls could do it.	而我认为姑娘们能够做到
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds of traditional thinking.	法塔赫组织成员：我们必须清空头脑中 传统的观念
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.	哈马斯组织成员： 我们是完全和平的 我们希望让它遍及整个巴勒斯坦
Chanting: One united nation.	口号声：团结一致的民族
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!	法塔赫 哈马斯 人民阵线
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.	新闻主播：围墙附近的冲突仍在继续
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.	记者：以色列边警受命驱逐抗议人群
They were allowed to use any force necessary.	他们被允许采用一切必要的强制手段
These are live bullets.	男子：他们正在开火
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.	这里就像费卢杰（伊拉克城市） 到处是枪声
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.	以色列行动主义者：我知道我们是去送死
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.	但是我身边的许多人没有一丝畏惧
Israeli A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear].	以色列士兵：一场非暴力抗议 无法阻止我们建立这堵墙
Protester: This is a peaceful march.	抗议者：这是一场和平的示威游行
There is no need to use violence.	我们不需要使用暴力
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!	口号声：我们必胜 我们必胜
We can do it!	我们必胜
Julia Bacha: When I first heard about the story of Budrus, I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago, in 2003.	朱莉娅·帕夏：当我第一次 听说布德鲁斯的这段故事 我感到非常惊讶 全球媒体居然 没有报道在2003年 也就是七年以前所发生的 这一系列了不起的事件
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful.	而更令人吃惊的是 布德鲁斯最终取得了胜利
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance, convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line, which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.	经过长达10个月的和平抵抗运动 那里的居民 说服了以色列政府 将围墙从他们的土地迁出 转而迁到绿线上 也就是国际公认的 巴以领土分界线上
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.	布德鲁斯的抵抗运动的影响 从此遍及 约旦河西岸的所有村庄 以及耶路撒冷境内的巴勒斯坦人居住区
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories.	然而 媒体对这些事件 几乎只字未提
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow, or even survive, in Palestine.	这种漠视 给巴勒斯坦 非暴力运动的成长 甚至生存 产生了沉重的打击
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause.	暴力抵抗 和非暴力抵抗 有一个非常重要的共同点 两者像一个剧院 渴望吸引观众的青睐
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue, it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight.	如果暴力演员 总是领衔主演 将全球目光 聚焦巴勒斯坦问题 那么 非暴力领导人 就很难向他们的民众证明 和平的反抗 才是带他们脱离苦海的 可行方案
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room.	在座为人父母的 估计对关注的力量 并不陌生
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit.	如果孩子第一次闹脾气 就得到父母的注意 那么你的孩子以后 肯定会闹得更厉害
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior, since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it.	闹脾气就会成为 儿童心理学家所说的 功能性行为 孩子学会 用这种方式引起父母的注意
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children.	父母可以通过 关注或不予理睬 来鼓励或抑制此行为
But that's true for adults too.	而这也适用于成年人
In fact, the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced, depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention.	事实上 社区和国家的行为 是能够受到影响而改变的 而这取决于 国际社会 选择关注的方面
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.	我相信 解决中东地区的冲突 给这里带来和平 关键是 我们要通过 更多地关注 当地的非暴力领袖 来把非暴力行动转变为一种功能性行为
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation.	在约旦河西岸 加沙地带以及东耶路撒冷地区拍摄那里的村庄时 我亲眼目睹了 区区一部纪录片 对行为转变所带来的影响
In a village called Wallajeh, which sits very close to Jerusalem, the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus.	在离耶路撒冷很近的 一个名叫瓦拉杰的村子 那里的村民面临着 与布德鲁斯相似的困境
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access, either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.	他们即将被包围起来 失去大片土地 无法自由进入 约旦河西岸或耶路撒冷
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention.	在进行了长达两年的非暴力抵抗之后 他们最终心灰意冷 因为他们没有得到任何人的注意
So we organized a screening.	于是我们在那里组织播放了纪录片
A week later, they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date.	一周之后 他们组织了一场在当时 参与人数最多 最有纪律的游行示威
The organizers say that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film, felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing, that people cared.	组织者们说 当村民在纪录片中看到 布德鲁斯的故事 他们感觉到 确实有人与他们志同道合 人们是在乎的
So they kept on going.	于是他们没有放弃
On the Israeli side, there is a new peace movement called Solidariot, which means solidarity in Hebrew.	以色列 有一个新的和平运动 被称为索里德拉尔特 在希伯来语中意为团结一致
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools.	布德鲁斯的故事成为了这个运动的领导者 招兵买马的主要手段之一
They report that Israelis who had never been active before, upon seeing the film, understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities.	他们反映说 那些从未加入任何运动的以色列人 看了纪录片之后 了解了非暴力抵抗的力量 并开始加入他们行动
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior.	瓦拉杰 和索里德拉尔特运动的例子 告诉我们 即使是小成本的独立电影 也能够帮助 非暴力抵抗 转变为一种功能性行为
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in, Ni'lin, Wallajeh, in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible, valued and effective in their work.	想象一下 主流媒体若是开始报道 每周在贝拉因 尼亚林 瓦拉杰等村庄 以及耶路撒冷境内的 香克哈拉和西路万 巴勒斯坦居住区里 发生的非暴力示威活动 这将产生多么巨大的力量 更多的人会关注 非暴力运动领导者 重视他们 让他们的工作更有成效
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts, they are invisible, and it's as if they never happened.	我相信 最重要的是 我们要认识到 如果我们不关注这些运动 它们就是隐形的 仿佛从来没有发生过
But I have seen first hand that if we do, they will multiply.	但我以亲身经历为证 如果我们关注 这些运动就会得到发展
If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.	它们一旦发展 其影响力 就会遍及巴以冲突
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation.	这种影响 能够最终 将冲突化解
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus.	这些领导者证明了非暴力运动 在布德鲁斯这样的地方是可行的
Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere.	我们一起来关注他们 让他们证明这在任何地方都是可行的
I'm going to give you four specific examples -- and I'm going to cover at the end -- about how a company called Silk tripled their sales by doing one thing, how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact, to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect.	 艺术家杰夫-昆斯是怎样从一个原来什么都不是 变成一个挣了一大堆钱并且十分有影响力的人， 弗兰克-盖里是怎样重新定义一个建筑师所代表的正真含义。
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years, a record label I started that had a CD called "Sauce."	最为一个市场营销人员，在过去的几年中我犯得最大的错误之一就是， 创建了一个唱片公司，发行了一张叫酱汁的唱片。
Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread, and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.	在开始之前我得和你们说一个名叫奥托-罗韦德尔的家伙以及发生在他和切片面包之间的故事。
Now, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said?	好，1910年在切片面包被发明之前 我想知道那时的人们说了什么？
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something.	像之前的伟大发明一样，电报或者别的什么东西。
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread, and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.	当时这个名叫奥托-罗韦德尔的家伙发明了切片面包， 和大多数发明家所做的一样，他把所有的注意力集中在销售和制造上。
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -- that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it; no one knew about it; it was a complete and total failure.	事实上关于切片面包这项发明当初是这样一个情况—— 最初15年里在人们可以得到它的情况下 没有人购买，没有人知道。它是一个彻头彻尾失败的发明。
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread, no one wanted it.	原因就在于Wonder牌面包出现之前， 在切片面包的理念走进千家万户之前，根本就没有人想要它。
That the success of sliced bread, like the success of almost everything we've been talking about at this conference, is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like -- it's about can you get your idea to spread, or not.	其实切片面包的成功， 就像今天我们在这里讨论其他所有成功的事物一样， 它并不是总带着诸如它的专利是怎样的，或者它的工厂是怎样的疑问， 关键是你能不能把你的想法传播开来。
And I think that the way you're going to get what you want, or cause the change that you want to change, to happen, is that you've got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread.	我认为得到你想要的， 改变你想改变的，你想让它发生的， 关键是你得想出一个能使你想法得到传播的方法。
And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual, or you're in business, or you're flying hot air balloons.	对我来说无论你正经营着一家咖啡馆 还是你是一个知识分子，或者你是一个商人，甚至你正驾驶着一个热气球在天上飞。
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.	这适用于任何你所从事的任何职业不管我们是干什么的。
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.	我们正生活在一个想法蔓延的年代。
That people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.	只有懂得传播想法的人才是赢家。
And when I talk about it I usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation, and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.	通常说起它我就会拿做生意作为例子 因为我可以把最好看的剪贴画放到我的呈现中来 并且生意的成功与否很容易衡量
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.	但是当我使用这些例子的时候我希望你们能原谅我 因为我所说的一切都需要你们自己花时间去验证。
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.	想法传播的核心是电视和类似电视的东西。
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.	某种程度上电视和大众传媒使得我们传播想法变得更加容易。
I call it the "TV-industrial complex."	我称之为电视工业中心。
The way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution.	它的运作流程是这样的，首先你买了一些广告—— 它影响一些人——接着你得到客户。
You use the distribution you get to sell more products.	然后把更多的产品买给他们。
You take the profit from that to buy more ads.	最后赚了钱的你继续做更多的广告。
And it goes around and around and around, the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.	它就是这样不停地循环循环循环， 相同的方法我们的军工业已经用了很长时间。
And that model of, and we heard it yesterday, if we could only get onto the homepage of Google, if we could only figure out how to get promoted there, if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat, and tell them about what we want to do.	并且那样的模式，我们昨天就已经听说了， 如果我们能上谷歌的主页， 如果我们想办法在那里获得排名， 如果我们能抓住那些人的要害， 告诉他们关于我们想做的事。
If we do that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.	如果我们那样做的话每个人都会引起注意，这样我们才有可能达到推广的目的。
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.	是的，这样的电视工业中心曾经鼓舞着我的整个童年或许还有你的。
I mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting, in a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad, over and over and over again until they bought it.	我的意思是，所有那些成功的产品是因为有些人知道 怎样用一种出人意料的方式与人建立起联系， 用一种未必需要一个广告的方法， 反反复复直到人们买下它。
And the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.	接着就发生了一件事，大家都把电视给关了。
That just over the last few years, what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to.	只是在最近几年里， 那些推销产品的人发现 以前的工作方法现在已经失效了。
This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it.	这张图片十分模糊，我很抱歉，那是我感冒时拍的。

The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year.	产品经理为那个装在蓝色盒子里的东西花了一亿美元 试着在一年内引起我的注意。
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff -- all so I could ignore every single message.	用一亿美元制造出来的电视广告和杂志广告还有垃圾邮件 外加那些优惠券、限量供应、红利—— 那些所有我都可以直接忽略掉的单个信息。
And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem.	于是我就把它们给忽略了因为在购买止疼药这一点上我没有任何疑问。

Now there are magazines about water.	现在居然出现了只谈论水的杂志。
New products from Coke Japan -- water salad.	这是来自可口可乐日本公司的新产品——色拉水。
OK. Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks, because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not.	不错。每过三个星期，他们就会推出一款新产品。 因为他们完全不知道哪样产品会大卖，哪样不会。
I couldn't have written this better myself.	接下来的这个更绝。四天前出来的。
It came out four days ago -- I circled the important parts so you can see them here.	 我就圈出了关键的部分然后你可以在这里看到。
They've come out ... Arby's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold, hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.	它们来了……阿比汉堡打算花八十五亿美元来宣传一只隔热手套 用汤姆-阿诺德的声音， 希望那会使人走进阿比汉堡店买一个烤牛肉三明治。
Now, I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold, that would get you to get in your car, drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich.	我在想，他们究竟要在一个动画电视广告里搞些什么鬼， 还要配搭上汤姆－阿诺德的声音，才能让你开着车， 穿过城，去买一个烤牛肉三明治。

Consumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care.	消费者一点都不在乎你，他们就是不在乎。
Part of the reason is -- they've got way more choices than they used to, and way less time.	部分原因是——他们比过去有更多选择的机会， 和更少的时间。
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.	在一个我们有太多选择 而时间有限的世界里，无疑我们会对有些东西视而不见。
And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before.	打个比方来说，当你正在路上开车的时候 如果你看见一头母牛，然后你会继续开车 因为你之前见过母牛。
Cows are invisible.	母牛是视而不见的。

I could do that again if you want it.	只要你愿意我可以重复一遍。
If the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while.	如果那只母牛是紫色的，你可能就会留意它一段时间。
I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too.	我的意思是，如果所有的母牛都是紫色的，你同样会感到无趣。
The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is: is it remarkable?	一件事它可以决定人们谈论什么， 做什么，改变什么， 购买什么，制造什么， 关键是——这是一件不同寻常的事吗？
And "remarkable" is a really cool word because we think it just means neat, but it also means -- worth making a remark about.	与众不同实在是一个十分酷的词因为我们常常把它理解为巧妙的意思， 它还意味着——值得我们去讨论。
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going.	这就是想法传播的本质。
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car, big enough to hold a mini in its trunk.	在美国所有热销的汽车中，两辆中的其中一辆是价值五万五千美元的大汽车， 大到足够在它的后备箱中再放入一辆小汽车。

Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes.	在美国每周DVD销量排行榜的第一名都在变化。
It's never "The Godfather;" it's never "Citizen Kane;" it's always some third rate movie with some second rate star.	不会永远都是《教父》，不会永远都是《公民凯恩》， 他们通常是一些三流电影配上二流影星
But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out.	但它成为第一名的原因仅仅是因为它是这周发行的。
Because it's new, because it's fresh.	因为它是新出的，因为它是新鲜的。
Because people saw it and said -- I didn't know that was there -- and they noticed it.	因为大家看见了都会说——我不知道它在那里—— 然后就会去留意它。
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box, and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them.	近二十年零售业里两个最成功的故事—— 一个是把装在蓝色盒子里的东西卖得超贵， 另一个是尽可能地把他们制造出来的东西卖得更便宜。

We're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living, we're in the fashion business.	最近很流行做服装生意，为了生存不管我们做什么， 服装行业都会长盛不衰。
And the thing is, people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it.	有一件事就是，服装行业的人 知道这个行业会变成什么样子，因为他们早就习惯了。
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.	对于剩下的我们不得不想清楚应该怎样去思考。
How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads, or insisting on meetings with people.	怎样去理解这不是关于用整幅大页面广告去妨碍人们， 或者是坚持让别人看见。

This chair -- they sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair.	这个家伙，他叫莱昂内尔-普尔兰，全世界最有名的面包师—— 就在两个半月以前他刚刚去世， 他是我心目中的英雄和好朋友。
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought, to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work.	他住在巴黎。去年他总共卖出了价值一千万美元的法式面包。
This guy, Lionel Poilane, the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago, and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.	每条面包在他自己的面包房里进行烤制，一位面包师负责一条面包那样，在一个木质的烤箱里。
He lived in Paris.	他们不想买这种面包。
Last year he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread.	它看起来不像法国的面包。
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.	但正是因为这种面包的巧妙和与众不同，慢慢地它被人口相传 直到最后，它变成了巴黎三星级酒店的官方面包。
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it.	现在莱昂内尔生活在伦敦，而他的面包正被联邦快递运至世界各地。
They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like "French bread."	过去我们的商家常常生产普通的商品给我们普通人。
It wasn't what they expected.	这就是大众营销。
It was neat; it was remarkable; and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.	不管极端消费者，只管主流消费群 那确实是一个很大的市场。
Now he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.	但他们对极客， 对有特殊爱好的人，对落伍者均视而不见。
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people.	所有产品均向着中间这部分的人而去。
That's what mass marketing is.	但是一个电视工业中心的世界正在离我们远去， 我认为这不再是一个我们会继续使用的销售策略。
Smooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market.	我认为不需要把东西卖给那些 经常对你产品视而不见的人。
They would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards.	应该把东西卖给真正在乎和关心你产品的人。
It was all about going for the center.	那些热衷于某些东西的人。
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken, I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.	当你讲话他们就会听 因为他们喜欢听——去和他们交流。
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you.	如果你足够幸运，他们会转告自己的朋友 那些在剩余曲线上的个体，然后它就会传播开来。
But market to these people because they care.	最后蔓延至整个曲线。
These are the people who are obsessed with something.	他们有一些东西我称之为御宅——这是一个伟大的日本单词。
And when you talk to them they'll listen because they like listening -- it's about them.	它是用来描述狂热的人 比方说，他们会大老远驾车穿过东京去品尝一款新推出的拉面， 因为那就是他们所做的。他们对此十分着迷。
And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread.	对于制造一个产品，营销一个想法， 提出任何你想解决问题的办法， 任何地方如果没有一群这样的御宅族 那几乎是行不通的。
It'll spread to the entire curve.	反之，你不得不找出一群人， 那些真正地，不顾一切地愿意听你说话的人。
They have something I call "otaku" -- it's a great Japanese word.	和他们交谈然后他们很容易就会把你的想法转告给朋友。
It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say, drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place, because that's what they do: they get obsessed with it.	这里有一个喜欢辣酱宅男，但是没有喜欢芥末的宅男。
To make a product, to market an idea, to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku, is almost impossible.	这就是为什么会有许多许多许多种类的辣酱， 而没有许多种类的芥末。
Instead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares about what it is you have to say.	不是因为很难去生产有趣的芥末 ——你可以制造出有趣的芥末—— 但是没有人会对芥末着迷， 因此也没有人会把它告诉朋友。
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.	香脆甜甜圈就是一家已经把这些事都给弄明白的公司。
There's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku.	他们有一个策略，他们所做的是， 进入一个城市，和御宅族的人交流 就这样在城市蔓延 哪怕是正巧在过马路的人。
That's why there's lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces, and not so many kinds of mustard.	这个溜溜球卖一百十二美元，但它在这只待了十二分钟。
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out.	这些家伙造出了世界上音量最大的车载音响。
Krispy Kreme has a strategy, and what they do is, they enter a city, they talk to the people with otaku, and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street.	它的声音可以媲美波音747，所以你进不去 这辆车装有防弹玻璃 不然的话它们可能会把挡风玻璃都给吹掉。
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes.	但事实依然告诉我们当有人 想把几个喇叭放进自己的汽车里时， 如果他们够宅 或者他们从哪里听说有人喜欢， 那么他们可以继续干下去而有人会为这辆车买单。
Not everybody wants it but they don't care.	真的很简单——把东西卖给听你说话的人， 或许，仅仅是或许，那些人会说给他们的朋友听。
They want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.	所以当史蒂夫-乔布斯在他的演讲上和五万人谈天说地的时候，没错， 那些来自一百三十个国家的人同时锁定同一个频道 一起观看他两个小时的商业演讲—— 这就是唯一能使他的公司正常运作的关键—— 有五万多个观众不顾一切地 看了他两小时的演讲，然后告诉他们的朋友。
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world.	珍珠酱乐队，最近的两年里发行了九十六张专辑。
It's as loud as a 747 jet.	并且每张专辑都赚到了钱。
But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car, if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does, they go ahead and they pick this.	那些在网上购买专辑的人都是御宅族 然后宅男会告诉他们的朋友，就这样一直传播下去。
It's really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening, and maybe, just maybe those people tell their friends.	这辆医院专用的婴儿床卖一万美元，比普通的婴儿床贵十倍。
So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote, right, who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-hour commercial -- that's the only thing keeping his company in business -- is that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial, and then tell their friends.	但比起其他婴儿床医院却以更快的速度买下它们。
Pearl Jam, 96 albums released in the last two years.	这是硬糖公司生产的指甲油，当然不会吸引到每一个人， 但只要碰上喜欢它的人，她们就会疯狂地谈论它。
They only sell them on their website.	它比一般涂料要贵百分之三十五 因为它们造出了一个人人都在谈论它的外壳，因为它与众不同。
Those people who buy them on the website have the otaku, and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.	不仅仅是他们在产品上扔出一个新的广告这么简单， 而是他们颠覆了传统意义上的油漆桶子。
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard.	我红不红网站——每天都有二十五万的人光临， 网站由两个志愿者管理，我能告诉你他们是相当苛刻，可是 他们没有绞尽脑汁在上面放更多的广告
It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.	我父亲就有一个这样的东西在他的写字台上， 老人家每天看着自己不断长大的孙子。
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product; they changed what it meant to build a paint product.	而且每个来他办公室的人 都想知道到关于这个相框是怎样来到他桌上的故事。
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site, run by two volunteers, and I can tell you they are hard graders, and they didn't get this way by advertising a lot.	每次只要有一个这样的人，想法就会得到传播。
They got this way by being remarkable, sometimes a little too remarkable.	这不是钻石，不是真正的钻石。
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back, and you plug it into the wall.	在你被火化以后你也可以把自己的骨灰变成宝石。
My father has this on his desk, and he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly.	哦，你喜欢戒指吗？它可是我的祖母。
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk.	于是墓葬行业变得十分火爆。
And one person at a time, the idea spreads.	不过你不需要变成奥齐-奥斯本—— 你不必非得变得像他一样超级无耻来做这件事。

They're made from "cremains."	这样的规则能快速总结出两三条。
After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem.	第一条是：当你达到一定规模使时设计就是免费的。
Oh, you like my ring?	宝洁公司很清楚，不是吗？
It's my grandmother.	作为典范整个宝洁公司 总是提供普通的产品给大家。

What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them.	很棒太无趣了。很棒太普通了。
A couple of quick rules to wrap up.	不管你是否正在录制一张专辑， 或者你是一个建筑师，还是你在社会学上有所建树。
The first one is: Design is free when you get to scale.	如果一件事很棒，它就不会产生效应，因为没有人会去留意它。
And the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them.	因此我有三个故事。
Number two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe.	首先是丝绸公司。他们将自己公司生产的不需要冷藏的产品 紧挨着牛奶冷藏区域放置。
Proctor and Gamble knows this, right?	销售额就这样翻了三倍。为什么？
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people.	牛奶，牛奶，牛奶，牛奶，牛奶——不是牛奶。
That's risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable.	对于那些看着冷藏区域里的产品的人来说， 这样的陈设就立刻变得与众不同了。
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.	三倍的销售额他们没有做任何广告， 他们只是把产品挪了一下位置变得更惹眼而已。
Very good is boring.	这是一件与众不同的艺术品。
Very good is average.	你用不着去喜欢它， 但一个四十英尺高的用灌木做成的狗 竖立在纽约市中心确实很与众不同。

Put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section.	我拿出一整套 专辑，但愿他们全部是 SACD格式——这是一种全新的储存格式—— 然后我把它卖给一个家里放着两万美元立体声音响的人。
Sales tripled. Why?	可他不喜欢这种新的音乐。

For the people who were there and looking at that section, it was remarkable.	有哪些人会举起他们的手然后对你说， 我想知道接下来你准备干什么， 把东西卖给他们。
They didn't triple their sales with advertising; they tripled it by doing something remarkable.	这是最后一个我想给你们举的例子。
That is a remarkable piece of art.	这是一副肥皂湖的地图，在华盛顿。
You don't have to like it, but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable.	正如你所见，它是在一个寸草不生鸟不拉屎的地方
Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum; he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see.	但是他们确实是有这么一个湖

The last example I want to give you.	谢谢所有在座的。
This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.	在人类文明中，有很多关于未来的 故事， 也许正是这些故事激励我们前行。
As you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it.	在一些故事中 有些人努力去收集和利用所有事物。
But they do have a lake.	在另一些故事中，所有事物都濒临灭亡。
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake.	但是我今天将带给你们一个不同的故事。
They don't anymore.	与所有故事一样，它也有一个开头。
So the founding fathers said, "We've got some money to spend.	在很长一段时间，我一直潜心于教育事业， 教大家 可持续性实用技能， 比如 在自家种菜， 利用本地的材料建造房子， 挖掘本地的能量源等等，这些都是为了帮助人们更好的承担责任。
What can we build here?" And like most committees, they were going to build something pretty safe.	我生活在爱尔兰，在那儿我建造了第一个稻草屋， 和一些圆形建筑以及类似的。
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist's rendering -- he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town.	很多年来我的工作都集中在 一个想法--可持续性， 它意味着：着眼于 全球经济增长模型， 既监控着自身就有的东西， 也监控着所产出排出的东西，
That's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing.	然后我就开始接触并以长远的目光观察 在实际中变化巨大的这一切。
I don't know about you but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.	为了介绍清楚， 在这里我打算揭开 一个当代伟大奇迹的发现。
Thank you very much for your attention.	它是如此惊天动地， 我想我还是先揭开它的面纱， 并好好喘口气，然后再告诉大家比较合适。
As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future, and where we might move forward from this point.	如果你们能帮我一把，那就完美了。
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.	这儿有一升石油。
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.	这瓶油 提炼取自上亿年前的地质， 经过远古的阳光照射， 它饱含的能量相当于5周的 艰苦的体力劳动， 也相当于35个壮劳力 为你服务。
But I want to tell you a different story here today.	我们可以用石油再加工成琳琅满目的新材料： 药物，现代纺织料， 笔记本电脑，还有其他不同的材料。
Like all stories, it has a beginning.	石油给予我们的历史发展中所需的无法想象的能量循环。
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education, in teaching people practical skills for sustainability, teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food, how to build buildings using local materials, how to generate their own energy, and so on.	我们赖以生存的社区设计， 经济学模型，旅游计划， 甚至经济增长的观点，可能有些人会怀疑， 假设我们将会永久持续使用石油。
I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland, and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.	如果我们退一步看， 整个人类历史， 我们所谓的石油时代， 仅仅是历史的一小段， 从我们发现这个特别的材料， 到完全依赖石油。
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model, and moderating what comes in at one end, and moderating the outputs at the other end.	但现在当我们处在能源的顶峰， 过去，我们的经济成功， 个人能力和福利 直接取决于我们消耗的石油的多少。 到现在我们对石油的依赖 正是我们的弱点。
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly.	越来越清晰的表明：我们 永远基于石油的事实 是站不住脚的。
And in order to introduce you to that, I've got something here that I'm going to unveil, which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.	我们每消耗4桶石油， 却只能发现1桶。
And it's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.	这个差距越来越大。
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.	事实是我们从石油中得到的能源 正在减少。
This is a liter of oil.	在1930年代，我们每个人可以从提炼石油中 得到100单位的能源。
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials, medicine, modern clothing, laptops, a whole range of different things.	就是为什么现在， 石油萃取的新突破技术，新边疆的 争夺如此激烈，不管是在Alberta地区， 还是在海底。
It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.	世界上有98个石油生产国，
We've based the design of our settlements, our business models, our transport plans, even the idea of economic growth, some would argue, on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.	但，其中65个已经超过了开采的峰值。
Yet, when we take a step back, and look over the span of history, at what we might call the petroleum interval, it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material, and then based a whole way of life around it.	世界平均开采早晚都会超过这个峰值， 人们只是想知道什么时候发生。
And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever.	不是的。
For every four barrels of oil that we consume, we only discover one.	而是伴随这个想法的 基础是基于一个现实的假设， 我们已经达到了开采巅峰。
And that gap continues to widen.	面对气候变化时， 也同样支持了这种转变方法。
There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.	当我和气候学家讨论时，我注意到 他们眼里与日俱增的恐惧， 伴随着最近的更新数据， 要比IPCC（联合国政府间气候变化专门委员会）讨论中的数据更有说服力，
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it.	IPCC的结论是： 我们可以预见2100年 在最坏的情况下，北极冰川严重断裂。
Completely unprecedented, historically.	事实上，如果目前的趋势继续恶化， 它将在5年或者10年内发生。
Already that's fallen to about 11.	如果北极永冻土中包含二氧化碳的3%， 在全球变暖中释放， 它将抵消我们所有为减少二氧化碳所做的努力， 在未来的40年间防范难以捉摸的气候变化。
And that's why, now, the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta, or at the bottom of the oceans.	除了我们深入实施紧急的二氧化碳减排，我们没有其他选择。
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.	但我一直很感兴趣地思考 故事可能是这样的： 我们以后的几代人 将会告诉我们。
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.	后代们生活在山顶， 忍受艰难，他们的遗产也很可怜。
The moment when the world on average passes this peak, people wonder when that's going to happen.	我喜欢的方法之一是 回首往事时人们通常这么说： 在拥有便宜的汽油和化石燃料之前， 人们依赖于他们的肌肉，动物肌肉中的能量， 或者一些风能，一些水能。
And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high.	我们有七联赛靴的故事： 一旦巨人穿上这样的靴子， 每迈出一步就可以完成7联赛，或者21英里， 对于没有这种功能靴子的人们来说， 这是一种完全无法想象的旅程。
But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are.	 假如你记得其他咒语，就可以停止做燕麦粥。
There is also the issue of climate change, is the other thing that underpins this transition approach.	否则，整个城市将被温燕麦粥淹没。
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists, is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes, as the data that's coming in, which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.	还有一个鞋匠和小矮人的故事。
So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.	鞋匠晚上没做完鞋就睡着了，当他早上睡醒的时候， 却发现所有的鞋子都神奇地做好了。
Actually, if current trends continue, it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.	对人类来说，这真是不可思议。
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.	现在，有Ryanair和Easyjet飞机形式的 七联赛靴。
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.	也有类似神奇魔术锅（格林童话神奇锅） 的Walmart和Tesco大型超市。
But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us.	还有就好比小矮人一样的中国。
"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain, that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."	但是我们不欢迎这些令人吃惊的 正发生的事情。
And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels, and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy, or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.	现在我们要讲的 正是我们期盼的关于前途的问题。
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots": the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on, with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles, a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.	我认为，有4个方向。
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot, where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words, this pot would just make as much food as you liked, without you having to do any work, provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.	通常的商业想法是 未来仅仅是现在的延续，甚至是更好。
Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.	但回顾去年，我认为那个想法 正在成为一个问题。
There is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."	从气候变化来看， 事实上这有点行不通。
The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and all the shoes are magically made for them.	还有一个碰壁的想法， 所有东西都变得很脆弱， 即将瓦解，全部崩溃。
It's something that was unimaginable to people then.	在一些地方，这种观点比较普遍。
Now we have the seven-league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.	第三种想法是：科技可以解决所有问题。
We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco.	 科技可以带领我们完全客服困难。
And we have the elves in the form of China.	我认为，这种观点在TED讨论者中比较普遍， 我们发明一种方法走出严峻的 经济和能源危机， 一种知识经济运动可以 远离能源束缚。 有观点是我们发现一些极好的新能源， 使得我们可以对 能源安全问题搁置一边， 我们可以轻松地迈入到 一个全新的可再生能源的世界。
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been.	但世界并非第二人生。
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now, as we look forward about where we're going to go.	我们不能凭简单地点击鼠标，然后创造出了新大陆和新能源体系。
And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual, that the future will be like the present, just more of it.	当我们坐在这里，彼此自由交流思想的时候， 仍然有人在挖煤， 目的是提取矿物质，为一些服务提供能量， 使它们运转。
But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question.	当我们早上坐下来， 查收我们邮件的时候， 早餐正从很远地方运来， 这通常影响了当地的，自给自足，更具恢复性的 餐饮系统，这种餐饮系统长久以来就有， 而我们却有效低估，甚至让这种餐饮系统消失。
There is the idea of hitting the wall, that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse.	能源和科技不是同一个事物。
This is a popular story in some places.	我潜心于转变响应的积极措施。
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything, that technology can somehow get us through this completely.	这是当前关于 石油开采峰值和气候变化的巨大挑战， 以及创造性和适应性和 我们迫切所需的想象力的响应。
But the world isn't Second Life.	像病毒一样，好似在雷达下的快速传播。
We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.	它是开源的。
And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other, there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals to make all of those things.	每个潜心于转变发展的人， 在工作中传递。
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances, usually at the expense of the local, more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past, which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.	自我组织，没有庞大的中央组织 去推动；人们仅仅有了一个想法 并且运行，贯彻执行。
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative.	集中解决问题。
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.	关注人们能够做什么， 设身处地的进行转变响应。
Energy and technology are not the same thing.	就不同地方和规模都会有出入。
What I'm involved with is the transition response.	转变也就完全不同。
And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need.	智利的转变小组，美国的转变小组，这里的转变小组， 你去的每个地方，大家的看法都不一样。
It's something which has spread incredibly fast.	从错误中可以学习到很多。
And it is something which has several characteristics.	这转变很有历史影响。它创造一种 历史性的机会 让人们去做不同寻常的事情。
It's viral.	在此过程中的确充满乐趣。
It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.	身体力行的人们感到无限乐趣， 人们也乐于联系在一起做这些转变。
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it.	支撑上述观点的是可恢复性理论。
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this; people just pick up an idea and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.	我认为，在多方面，这种可恢复性理论 比可持续理论更有用。
It's very much looking at what people can do where they are, to respond to this.	是关于系统， 安居置业，如何抵挡外部冲击。
It's sensitive to place and to scale.	当他们遇到外部冲击时， 他们不只是分解，或者崩溃。
Transitional is completely different.	我认为可恢复性理论比可持续理论更有用，正如我所说。
Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here, what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.	在任何时候，当超市只有2，3天的食物储备时， 通常可持续理论关注于 冰箱的能效， 和包裹生菜的包装。
It learns very much from its mistakes.	从可恢复性理论角度看， 我们从根本上质疑我们竟依赖于这种 如此脆弱的超市消费模式。
And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary.	可恢复性理论可以更广泛地运作： 它是基于我们所要转变的模块化建设， 和我们怎样组织生产自给自足必需品的转变社区建立。
And it's a process which is really joyful.	这是布里斯托尔市Bristol和湖区District的照片， 1897年，农业菜园市场协会Market Gardeners Association成立。
People have a huge amount of fun doing this, reconnecting with other people as they do it.	当时，布里斯托尔市Bristol 就在这个附近， 周围是商业市场菜园， 提供给城市所需的大量食物， 也创造很多就业机会，等等。
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.	这就是可恢复性的一个例子，希望你们喜欢， 我们现在只能带着羡慕的眼光回首那时。
And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.	因此，这个转变的想法如何运作？
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.	大体上有很多人为这个想法而兴奋不已。
When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.	他们观看电影，开展讨论等等。
And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.	这个转变过程有趣而富有创造力， 并增长见识。
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.	然后他们开始组建工作组，分别负责不同的方面， 因此基于此，形成了很多转变项目， 然后转变项目本身 开始运行和完善。
Looking through the lens of resilience, we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable.	在爱尔兰我开始了相关的工作， 爱尔兰是我教学的地方，也是工作开展的地方。
Resilience runs much deeper: it's about building modularity into what we do, building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.	目前已经有超过200个正式的转变项目。
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association, in 1897.	在我们所谓的酝酿阶段，有过千的工作人员。
This is at a time when the city of Bristol, which is quite close to here, was surrounded by commercial market gardens, which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.	他们正在酝酿方案将来的可行性。
There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time, which we can now only look back on with envy.	实际上大部分人做了大量的的工作。
So how does this transition idea work?	但他们实际上做什么呢？大家知道，这是一个新颖的想法， 但他们付诸的实际情况如何？
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.	因此，我认为重申这一点非常重要， 实际上大家知道，转变不是一个自身就能完成所有工作。
They pick up some of the tools that we've developed.	我们需要哥本哈根大会的国际立法等等。
They start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town.	我们需要得到国内的响应，本地政府的响应。
They show films, they give talks, and so on.	但所有事情都会变得非常简单， 如果我们有活跃的社区以及最新的想法交流， 然后领导转变响应，使得相关政策通过候选立法， 在接下来的5到10年。
It's a process which is playful and creative and informative.	自然而然的就有一些当地的食物项目， 例如社区团体支持的农业计划， 城乡食物计划，当地食物目录等等。
Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this, and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable.	目前很多地方都开始建立自己的能源工厂， 社区自建能源工厂， 由社区独立投资， 开始建立 可再生能源基础设施，这正是我们需要的。
So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland, where I was teaching, and has since spread.	在许多地方，学校也参与进来。
There are now over 200 formal transition projects.	位于迪恩森林国家公园附近的Newent市：人们在学校建起大型保温棚， 孩子们学习如何种植食物。
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.	提倡再循环利用，例如菜园共享， 使得没有菜园的人们 可以在被人闲置的菜园地方，种植食物。
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.	在广阔的城乡种植经济树木。
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.	同时开始推广 可替换的流通货币的想法。
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea, but what do they actually do on the ground?	这是在苏塞克斯Sussex的刘易斯市Lewes 最近投放上市的刘易斯英镑， 它只能在当地流通， 成为了当地循环经济的开始。
Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.	而你在其他地方用这种货币，它就一文不值了。
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.	但实际上这种循环经济模式在当地 非常有效。
We need national responses. We need local government responses.	他们做的另一件事，我们称之为节约能源计划， 是为城镇而开发的另一个B计划。
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies, community-owned energy companies, where the community can invest money into itself, to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.	这也吸引了政府议员，这个国家能源部长埃德米利班德Ed Miliband的兴趣， 我们邀请他参加我们最近的会议 作为一个演讲听众。
A lot of places are working with their local schools.	他 并从此成为整个转变想法的极力提倡者。
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food.	这个国家目前有两个当地政府 声明它们要转变为不依赖石油的当地政府， 莱斯特郡Leicestershiere 和萨默塞特郡Somerset。在斯特劳德市Stroud 转变组真的为当地政府起草了食物计划。
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.	委员会主席说， 如果我们没有转变斯特劳德市Transition Stround，我们也得首次创新 所有社区的基础设施。
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.	正如我们看到的转变响应的蔓延，国家的转变提上议程。
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.	正如大家所见，目前所有地方都开展了。
This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.	不过，转变的关键是我们现在没有改变所有， 但很多已经不可避免的改变了， 我们所做的就是创造性的开展工作， 提出正确的问题。
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.	我们自己谈论着实际中的故事， 除这里分享的，我们还缺乏大量故事来指导我们创新的转变。
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.	关键的一点是 人们把他们做的这种转变创新的故事用来分享。
Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.	例如，社区可以自行生产 21英镑纸币， 把学校的汽车停车场转变为一个食物菜园地， 建立自己能源工厂的社区等等的故事。
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on.	对我来说，最近一个精彩的故事 是奥巴马夫妇在白宫南草坪 开辟蔬菜园地。因为上次这么做还要 提起埃莉诺罗斯福Eleanor Roosevelt， 它引领了全美2千万蔬菜菜园的兴建。
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody?	所以我留给你们的问题是， 为了你们社区繁荣，考虑所需的方方面面 的事情， 如何实施这种转变响应来 大幅降低二氧化碳排放， 又同时建立可恢复性的繁荣？
As a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."	从我个人而言，我非常的感谢 我所经历过的廉价石油年代。
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.	我曾非常幸运，我们曾非常幸运。
From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world.	让我们为石油所提供给我们的一切感到荣幸， 但从现在起要转变改进。
We're getting a lot of interest from government.	因为如果我们依然依靠石油，继续这样的消耗 支撑着我们的选择权， 我们所要面对的未来会越加难以驾驭。
Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener.	由热爱石油，到远离石油 和石油年代供给给我们的一切， 我们将开创 一个更具有可恢复性的， 更有活力的世界， 我们将发现人与人彼此间更加健康，更加优秀， 和联系的更加紧密。
Which he did -- -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.	非常感谢。
There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities, Leicestershire and Somerset.	人会干傻事。
And the head of the council said, "If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time."	这句话是一家英国报纸的头条， 不久之前出版的《卫报》。
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.	我很好奇，请大家举个手，谁同意这句话？
In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this.	哦，有一两位勇士。
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now, but that things are already inevitably changing, and what we need to do is to work creatively with that, based on asking the right questions.	这句话实际上出自一位流行病学家之口 她研究HIV已有15年， 足迹遍布四大洲， 你们现在正看着她。
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories.	我现在想说明 这句话只说对了一半。
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.	理智是公共卫生的 首要准则。
Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company.	 现在你戴上公共卫生怪胎眼镜， 你便会知道如果你提供给人们必要的信息 告诉他们什么对他们好，什么不好， 如果你给他们必要的服务 使他们能对上述信息做出反应， 再加上一丁点的鼓励， 人们就会做出理智的决定 从此健康长寿。
And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden.	好极了。
So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?	 如果你参加了TED07， 就知道HIV与咖啡的价格紧紧相关；
Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil.	实际上，HIV和性交，毒品脱不了干系。
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.	 如果说世上有两样东西 使人类丧失理智， 那就是勃起和上瘾。
But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point.	那么，我们先说说瘾君子认为什么不和逻辑。
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.	我曾经和一位印尼的朋友，Fankie，聊天。
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other.	我们一起吃午餐，他跟我讲 他在巴里岛监狱里注射毒品的经历。
Thank you very much.	那天是一个人的生日，他们偷偷将一些海洛因 弄进了监狱， 他非常大方地邀请牢房里的兄弟们 一起享用。
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper, The Guardian, not that long ago.	 过生日的那个人 准备好注射器， 蹲下身，开始给兄弟们注射海洛因。
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for 15 years, worked on four continents, and you're looking at her.	Frankie说：我是第22个， 我看见针管离我越来越近， 地上到处都是血。
And I am now going to argue that this is only half true.	针管越来越钝。
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm in public health, and if you put your public health nerd glasses on, you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them, if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information, and a little bit of motivation, people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives.	我脑子里在想， 真是恶心死了 太危险了， 但是我更关心的是， 拜托，拜托到我的时候 针管里还有点海洛因。
Wonderful.	拜托给我留一点。
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV, and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality, and if you were at TED '07 it's about coffee prices ...	 故事讲完后， Frankie说： 你知道，天， 毒品真能让你蠢到极点。
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction.	而且，你知道，他这句话你挑不出一点毛病，
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.	但是Frankie那时， 是个瘾君子，而且他被关在监狱。
We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.	所以他只能选择 要么接受那血迹斑斑的针头，要么就没法过瘾。
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail, and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues.	如果真有什么地方你确实很想过过瘾， 那就是监狱。
And so everyone lined up, all the smackheads in a row, and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit, and he went down and started injecting people.	但现在我是位科学家， 我不会用八卦故事当数据， 所以现在来看看数据。
So he injects the first guy, and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt, and he injects the next guy.	我们采访在印尼的三座城市的 600名瘾君子， 我们问他们：你知道你怎么感染HIV的吗？
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line, and I can see the needle coming down towards me, and there is blood all over the place.	哦，当然知道。
It's getting blunter and blunter.	共用一个针头。
And a small part of my brain is thinking, 'That is so gross and really dangerous,' but most of my brain is thinking, 'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me.	我是说，差不多100%，对，都是共用针头害的。
Please let there be some left.'"	我们又问：你知道在哪可以买到 干净又便宜的针头吗？
And then, telling me this story, Frankie said, "You know ... God, drugs really make you stupid."	
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.	100%的人都答道：哦，知道。
But, actually, Frankie, at that time, was a heroin addict and he was in jail.	我们吸毒，我们当然知道上哪儿去弄干净的针头。
And if there's one place you really want to get high, it's when you're in jail.	那你们会带着针头吗？
But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes, so let's look at some data.	我们采访的那些地方就在街上， 瘾君子们聚集在一起服毒。
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that?"	我们这样问他们，他们说：你疯了？
"Oh yeah."	你当然不会愿意和别人共用针头，就像你绝不愿意共一把牙刷， 就算他是你的情人也不行。
"So are you carrying a needle?"	
We're actually interviewing people on the street, in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.	现在，在印尼 如果你被逮到藏有针头，就会被警察抓走， 丢进监狱.
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10, and the other nine in 10 are sharing.	因为这时你的选择就是， 要么用现在自己的针头， 要么现在和别人用一个针头 感染上病 过个十年因此而死， 或者我可以现在用自己的针头 明天就去蹲监狱。
So you've got this massive mismatch; everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV, but they're all sharing anyway.	虽然瘾君子们认为 置身于感染HIV的危险中绝不是什么好事， 但是在监狱里过一年 更加糟糕， 你很可能在监狱里遇上Frankie所说的情况 最终还是可能感染HIV。
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.	现在我们从政策决策者的角度看看这个问题。
There's just kind of an ick factor there.	实际上非常简单。
"No, no.	终于有一次，大家达成了一致意见。
We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."	从公共卫生角度，我们得出了理性的答案。
So, in Indonesia at this time, if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up, they could put you into jail.	我们希望瘾君子用干净的针头， 瘾君子也想用干净的针头。
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?	所以我们只用使瘾君子们能随时拿到针头 同时让他们不必担心被逮捕 就能解决这个问题。
And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV, they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway.	在这些国家里，你们可以看到， 低于百分之四的吸毒人员 曾因注射而感染HIV。
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles.	再看，没有实行这一政策的国家，比如纽约， 莫斯科，雅加达， 在峰值时， 每两个注射毒品的人中 就有一个感染了这种致命疾病。
Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.	撒切尔首相做这些 不是因为她对瘾君子有恻隐之心，
This is a really easy problem.	她这样做是她执政的国家 有国家免费医疗系统。
For once, your incentives are aligned.	所以，如果她不在有效疾病预防方面投资， 她以后就必须为疾病的治疗 付出昂贵的费用， 而且治疗的费用昂贵的多。
We've got what's rational for public health.	所以她做出了一个政治上很理智的决定。
You want people to use clean needles -- and junkies want to use clean needles.	现在，如果我带上我 公共卫生怪胎的眼镜， 再看看这些数据， 这完全不合逻辑。
So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest.	在美国，我们一直在做的事情是 验证数据，不断地验证。
Now, the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher.	于是上百个研究的数据 被大型的muckety-mucks 美国科学界圣人验证， 而大量的研究表明 针头计划是有效的。
And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program, and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.	再看，这些表明针头计划无效的研究 你们认为在这张烦人的幻灯片上， 我按一下手中的遥控器，剩下的数据就会出现， 但是，没有，这张幻灯片上就这么多内容。
And in all of those countries, you can see, not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV.	另外一栏什么也没有。
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example, Moscow, Jakarta -- we're talking, at its peak, one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease.	那么，这完完全全没有道理。 你肯定这样想，
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies.	只是，等下，不对，政客们也是理智的， 而且他们所做的事情是他们认为选民们想做的。
She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service.	我们看到的是选民们都 十分愿意回应这种情况 而不愿意回应这种情况。
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention, she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on, and obviously those are much higher.	所以拒绝向瘾君子提供服务 就显得很有道理。
So she was making a politically rational decision.	现在来说说性交。
Now, if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data, it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?	我们在性交上更理智吗？
But in this country, where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens, we've taken a very different approach.	呃，我根本不会去评论 天主教徒们那些 完全不和逻辑的想法。
So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.	 以为只要你免费发保险套， 人们就会出去找乐子。
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States, and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.	我不知道本尼迪克特教皇 是否会在线看TED的演讲， 但是教皇，您看的话，我有话要跟您讲。
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective -- you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up, but no -- that's the whole slide.	 我随身带着保险套， 但从来没机会用。
There is nothing on the other side.	这种机会可不容易找。
So, completely irrational, you would think.	接着，也许你的运气好一点。
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too, and they're responding to what they think the voters want.	OK，严格地说， HIV不是很容易 通过性交传染。
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this.	是否传染取决于你血液和体液所含的 病毒数量
Now let's talk about sex.	 而到了那一阶段，这里， 你会看起来很糟，感觉很不好， 不会发生很多性交。
Are we any more rational about sex?	所以通过性交感染HIV基本取决于 当你体内的病毒达到高潮时 的那一段非常短的时间段内 你有多少位同伴。
Well, I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church, who think somehow that if you give out condoms, everyone's going to run out and have sex.	这一来人们就要发疯了 因为这意味着你必须谈论 有些人在较短的时间内 比另外一些人有更多的同伴， 这样就太侮辱人了。
I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online, but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict -- I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid.	我一直都对此很好奇 因为我认为侮辱是件很不好的事情， 而然性交频繁却是件很好的事， 不过这事就这样吧。
It's not that easy!	事实是20年来 很出色的研究 告诉我们 有一些人更倾向于 在短时期内有很多伙伴，
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.	而基本上这些人， 都是出卖色情，有更多的同伴，
Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually.	在派对上的同性恋拥有的伙伴数量 平均比派对上的异性恋 多出两倍，
So, it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids.	还有些异性恋 他们来自的国家 有一妻多夫的传统 女性有较强的自主权， 大多数此类国家都在南部非洲的东部。
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected, then you start making antibodies, and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -- 10 or 12 years -- you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.	这些都反映在现在大范围流行的疾病上。
But basically, nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS, and by that stage, you're not looking great, you're not feeling great, you're not having that much sex.	大家看来自非洲的这些数据，让人不寒而栗。
So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia.	这些全部是南部非洲的国家 七分之一 到三分之一 的成年人 都感染了HIV。
Now, this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups, and that's considered stigmatizing.	而在世界其他国家， 基本上普通大众平安无事， 非常低的比率， 但是HIV携带率 在高危人群中的比率异常的高， 像注射毒品的瘾君子，性工作者， 男同性恋。
The truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time.	你只有和在传染期的携带者 发生无预防措施的性交才会染病。
And those groups are, globally, people who sell sex and their more regular partners.	在世界大多数地方， 有些预防措施失效了 但不多， 在性交易行业里 实际上，我们做的很不错。
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy, and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.	对公共卫生讲这是理智的行为 对个体性工作者也是理智的。 因为染上病会影响生意。
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.	没人希望如此。
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.	而且，也没有哪个顾客想带病回家。
These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven, and one in three of all adults, are infected with HIV.	所以最终，你可以在性交易行业 达到高安全套使用率。
Now, in the rest of the world, we've got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very, very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk: drug injectors, sex workers and gay men.	但是在亲密关系中， 就困难的多了 因为也许你的妻子或男友， 或你想进一步发展成为恋人或配偶的那个人， 因为某种浪漫的幻想 信任和亲密， 没有什么比亲爱的，用你的安全套还是我的 这样的问题，更让人扫兴的了。
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles: 25 percent prevalence among gay men.	所以，在那种情况下， 你需要有强大的意愿 才会使用安全套。
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.	就像这位先生，他叫Joseph。
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person.	来自海地，患有艾滋，
In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries.	现在他大概没有什么性交， 但是他提醒着其他的人们， 你为什么想用 安全套。
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.	这张也在海地，提醒着你 为什么想上床。
What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI.	好了，挺好笑，这张还是Joseph。
No one wants it.	 在进行抗病毒治疗6个月后（的照片）。
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.	这就是为什么我们称之为拉撒路效应。
So essentially, you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.	但是这样一来等式两边就不平衡了 在性交时 什么样的决定才是理智的。
But in "intimate" relations it's much more difficult because, with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things, we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy, and nothing is quite so unromantic as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.	我们听到 有些人说：这没什么要紧的 因为实际上，治疗非常有效 治疗使你体内的病毒减少了 所以就很难传递HIV了。
So in the face of that, you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms.	那么，如果大家再看看感染病毒的情况， 如果你在生病时就开始治疗， 你体内的病毒携带量就会下降。
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now, but he is a reminder in the population, of why you might want to be using condoms.	这些绿色部分，包括SPIKES， 是因为你没有去看医生 或者你没有药了，或者你去派对狂欢三天 完全忘记吃药， 或者你的身体开始产生抗药性，或者随便别的什么， 这些全部是病毒 不是因为治疗，这些都不会在这里。
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.	那我的意思是，好啊，多棒的预防策略啊，
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.	我们必须尽量让更多的人接受抗病毒的治疗。
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making.	但是我要提出一个问题 问那些说只要更多的治疗就足够我们预防艾滋的人 你们凭什么这么说。
So, what we've got -- some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much because, actually, treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."	我们看到 实际上，安全套的使用率 非常，非常高 同性恋群中，对HIV的反应也很迅速， 几乎不需要 公共卫生人员的帮助 接受治疗后，安全套的使用率开始锐减 主要有两个原因。 有一种想法是：呃， 要是他感染了，他肯定在吃药， 那他的病毒携带量就很低，所以我安全的很。
So, if you look at the viremia thing again, if you do start treatment when you're sick, well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.	另一个原因是人们根本 不像害怕艾滋一样 害怕HIV，这样想也对。
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes -- which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy, or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs, or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever -- all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.	真无聊， 就和每次做爱都要用安全套 一样的无聊， 不管你喝的多醉， 不管你和几个瘾君子上床，什么都不管
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.	看看数据，我们会发现 问题的答案就在 嗯——
Of course not, of course not.	不管是异性恋，大多数是性工作者 还是瘾君子， 在开始治疗之后，基本上没有出现任何状况， 这要归功于我先前提到的 那些鼓励政策
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.	但是男同性恋中， 在治疗广泛推行的 三四年内 数量却急剧上升。
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need.	这些是新增的感染者。
That's simply not necessarily true, and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now.	这意味着什么？
And what we've seen is that, actually, condom use rates, which were very, very high -- the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV, with extremely little help from public health nerds, I would say -- that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really: One is the assumption of, "Oh well, if he's infected, he's probably on meds, and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."	这意味着一方面人们不再那么害怕 而另一方面，病毒携带者的数量增加了， 更多人活的更长，更健康， 更可能身为HIV携带者依然进行性交 这些综合因素的影响 已超过了低病毒携带的影响， 这让我很担心。
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.	这意味着什么？
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you, and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day.	这意味着医疗方法越进步，我们越要加强预防力度。
And that's boring, but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex, no matter how drunk you are, no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?	实际情况时这样的吗？
If we look at the data, we can see that the answer to that question is, mmm.	不，我把这种情况称作同情难题。
So these are data from Scotland.	这两天我们常常讨论同情心。 现在的情况是人们 很难做到 为性工作者提供高质量的性和生育健康服务， 很难给瘾君子发针头，
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program.	但是一旦他们不再是不可饶恕的 瘾君子或性工作者， 而成为了艾滋病人， 我们会抛开一切情绪 为他们买昂贵的药物，直到他们生命终结的那天。
Then it came way down.	从公共卫生的角度讲 这完全没有道理。
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users, you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins, and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier.	我想对Ines说几句离别的话。
But in gay men, you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available.	Ines是为变性人，她在雅加达的街上当妓女。
This is of new infections.	 她是有小鸡鸡的女生。
What does that mean?	她为什么当妓女？
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer, healthier lives, more likely to be getting laid with HIV -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load, and that's a very worrisome thing.	当然是因为她被逼无奈 别无选择，等等等等，
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days, and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers, unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.	每个省份的情况稍微有点不同。
But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims, we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.	这张幻灯片上的数据 来自我在和15000名性工作者的谈话。 这是性工作者自报的 每小时的薪水。
It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view.	这个工作不怎么样，但是对很对人而言 确实很明智的选择。
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.	OK，Ines。
Well, of course, because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.	都是因为政治原因。
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.	当政治介入后，一切都变得毫无道理。
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia: on average, 20 cents.	Elizabeth Pisani：当政治介入后，一切都变得毫无道理。
It varies a bit province to province.	从性工作者的角度看， 政客们完全没有道理。
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?	这为什么重要呢？
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.	大约是市郊居民水平的 三分之一， 主要是因为居住在市郊的居民开车更多 而且他们住在相对比较分离的建筑里 你有那么多的外表面 会有能量流失．
Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."	所以如果严格的从 气候变化的角度来看， 城市已经 相对＂绿色＂了．
So, from the point of view of a sex worker, politicians are making no sense.	有一个减少 温室气体排放的好机会 实际上是把市郊变得更 ＂城市化＂．
From the point of view of a public health nerd, junkies are doing dumb things.	我们在市郊做的事， 实际上要求我们开两倍的路程．
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet, and that's one of the glories of human existence.	这一点就增加了我们对 外国石油的依赖， 尽管能源的利用率是在提高的．
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another, so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician, and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want.	我们多开了这么多路程， 但技术上我们并没有提高这么多．
But here's the thing: we are the voters.	公共卫生是另一个 让我们考虑旧城改造的原因．
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.	CDC和其它机构的研究者们 逐渐更多的把市郊的 发展模式和久坐不动的生活习惯 联系在一起．
And everyone who's in this room, and everyone who's watching this out there on the web, I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense.	而久坐不动的生活习惯又一直与 相当让人警觉的 肥胖率的增加联系在一起， 这地图里就显示了这一点， 而且肥胖症也是心脏疾病 和糖尿病急剧增加的 一个诱发原因 这个问题已经发展到了，一个现在新出生的婴儿 将会有三分之一的可能 发展成为糖尿病．
It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there, but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV.	这一比率也随着孩子们不再走路 去学校的比率一起 逐步升级． 原因同样也是我们发展模式的问题．
Thank you.	而且还有最后一个问题－－关于是否能负担得起的问题
In the last 50 years, we've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences.	我是说，照着汽油的价格 不断上涨的趋势，还有多少人 能负担得起在市郊生活呢？
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia.	把市郊扩大到便宜的土地去， 在过去的五十年里－－ 便宜的土地也基本耗尽了－－ 帮助了几代人 享受美国梦．
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots, I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing, especially retail, sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places.	但越来越多的情况是， 住在市郊，开车开到我们能负担起的好环境居住的想法， 能帮我们省下的钱－－ 这也基本上是我们的范例－－ 这些能省钱的便利也基本都没有了， 如果你考虑到交通的开销的话．
And in the process, what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost, and have the infrastructure in place, instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges.	举例来说，在亚特兰大， 大约有一半的有房的人 年收入在二万到五万美金之间． 他们要用去百分之29的收入 在房子上 并要用掉百分之32的收入 在交通上．
So why is this important?	这是2005年的数字．
I think there are any number of reasons, and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.	这是在汽油价格涨到每加仑4美元之前．
Just from the perspective of climate change, the average urban dweller in the U.S.	其实，我们中没有人 真的愿意来计算我们在交通上花的钱． 而且这个数字在 近期之内也不会减少．
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller, mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more, and living in detached buildings, you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of.	不管你是不是喜欢市郊那种有很多树木又很隐私的地方， 又或者你讨厌市郊路边那种没什么灵魂的商业小店 总会有很多理由来说明改建是很重要的．
So strictly from a climate change perspective, the cities are already relatively green.	但它可行吗？
The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs.	我认为是的．
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs, we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.	June Williamson 和我一直在研究这个课题 有十年多的时间了． 我们找到了80多个 各式各样的项目．
It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency.	但这都是根据市场的需求来的． 具体的推动市场的原因有： 第一条是有大的人口变动．
We're just driving so much more; we haven't been able to keep up technologically.	我们总是认为市郊是 一个特别以家庭为中心的地方． 但其实已经不是这样的了．
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting.	从2000年开始， 有三分之二的市郊家庭 已经不再有孩子了．
Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles.	我们只是还没跟上现实的脚步．
And those have been linked then with the rather alarming, growing rates of obesity, shown in these maps here, and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes.	这其中的原因有很大程度和 现在两大的人口群体占主要 势力有关． 二战后生育高峰期出生的人已经退休， 这之后是一个间断， 二十世纪六七十年代出生的人，是人较少的一代．
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore, again, because of our development patterns.	他们还要孩子． 但之后出生的拥有互联网的这一代人 还没有到养育孩子的年龄．
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.	他们是另一个人较多的一代．
But increasingly, the savings promised by drive-till-you-qualify affordability -- which is basically our model -- those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs.	并且市场调研和消费者调研 调查生育高峰期的出生的人和拥有互联网的一代人， 他们想要什么， 他们想住在什么样的地方， 告诉我们将有对更多的城市生活方式的很大需求 其实我们已经能在市郊里 观察到 这一点．
For instance, here in Atlanta, about half of households make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year, and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation.	生育高峰期出生的一代想在合适的地方安度晚年， 拥有互联网的一代又想过 城市的生活方式， 但他们的工作依旧大多数在外面的市郊．
I mean, that's 2005 figures.	另一个巨大的变动是 那些不被充分利用的 沥青的表现。
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.	我一直想，对一个独立的摇滚乐队 这会是一个很棒的名字． 但开发商一直用它来 指未充分利用的停车场． 市郊到处是这样的停车场．
You know, none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs, and they're not going down any time soon.	当战后，人们第一次在 远离市中心的便宜的土地上 建市郊的时候， 只修建路面的停车场 是很乎道理的．
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips, there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.	但这些地方已经成了孩子们 玩跳蛙游戏的地方， 而我们只知道再接着像更远的地方延伸． 现在这些地方 已相对是中心的地带了．
But is it practical?	只修路面停车场已经不再合适了．
I think it is.	这些土地远不止路面停车场这样的价值．
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade, and we've found over 80 varied projects.	现在，合适的做法是回到从前的做法， 在这些地方向上建， 建几层的停车场．
But that they're really all market driven, and what's driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts.	所以我们该拿 荒废的商场， 荒废的园区公园怎么办呢？
We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place, but that's really not the case anymore.	其实可以用来做很多事．
Since 2000, already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them.	在一个较慢发展的经济条件下，就像我们这样 把不再利用的房子重新利用起来 是一种很普遍的策略．
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.	这是一个在圣路易斯 不被利用的商场 被重新改建成了艺术空间．
The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now: the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap, Generation X, which is a small generation.	它现在既是艺术工作室， 也是剧团和舞蹈表演队的排练场所．
They're still having kids -- but Generation Y hasn't even started hitting child-rearing age.	它现在虽然不能吸收像以前一样多的 税收收入． 但它还在为它所在的社区服务．
They're the other big generation.	它始终都亮着．
So as a result of that, demographers predict that through 2025, 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them.	在我看来，它现在成为一个很好的机构．
And the market research, consumer research, asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like, what they would like to live in, tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we're already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia.	其它被重新利用的商场， 有的改成了养老院 有的改成了大学， 还有各种办公场所．
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place, and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle, but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.	我们还找到了许多 把废弃的集装箱式的商场 改建成为 各式各样的服务社区的机构， 比如许多的学校，教堂， 还有像这样的图书馆．
The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt.	这原来是一个很小的杂货店，名叫＂Food Lion＂ 现在成了一个公共图书馆．
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band, but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots -- and suburbia is full of them.	除此之外，我认为，还做了一个很漂亮的适应性的重新利用， 挖开原来的停车空间， 改建成生物湿地，以此来收集并清理雨水， 建了更多的人行道 来连接到附近的地区．
When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown, it made sense to just build surface parking lots.	有人已经把 街边的一家商店 改建成了社区集会的场所．
But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again, as we've just continued to sprawl, and they now have a relatively central location.	这是一个小的L形状的购物中心 在凤凰城，亚利桑那州．
It no longer just makes sense.	他们只是把这重新粉刷过，看上去更新一点， 弄成一个美食杂货店， 他们又把旧的邮局改造成了饭店．
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.	千万别小看了美食的力量， 它能把一个地方彻底改变 变成大家都想去的地方．
It turns out, all sorts of things.	贴在附近的房地产广告里 很骄傲的说， ＂走路就能到勒格兰德＂ 因为它给附近的地区 提供了社会学家们称之为的 ＂第三个地方．＂
In a slow economy like ours, re-inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies.	如果家是第一个地方， 工作单位是第二个地方 第三个地方就是你出去休闲 和社区的人打交道的地方．
So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that's been re-inhabited as art-space.	尤其是当市郊已经不再 那么重视家庭的时候， 对于有家的人们， 确实是有一种需求 想要有一个＂第三个地方．＂
It's now home to artist studios, theater groups, dance troupes.	最戏剧性的重建 是在下一类里要谈到的， 是另一个策略，重新发展．
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was, but it's serving its community.	在繁荣时期，就有过几个 很戏剧化的重新发展的项目 那些原来的建筑 被推倒了．整个地区内相当多的地方 都进行了重新建造， 建造成了一种紧凑的，能走路从一个地方到另一个地方的市区环境．
It's keeping the lights on.	这些地区有些在这一过程中升值了．
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.	这是Mashpee公共用地， 我们找到的最老的翻新例子．
Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes, as universities, and as all variety of office space.	在过去的二十年里，这逐渐地在 停车场上 建起了城市的格局．
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools, lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one.	黑白照片显示的是 60年代简单的购物中心．
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store, that is now a public library.	上面那张图 显示了它逐渐改变 成一个紧凑的结构， 和新英格兰村庄想接 并在新的计划里， 它被批准和 新的住宅区域联在一起 跨过干线 在另一边接着发展．
In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse, they tore up some of the parking spaces, put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff, put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods.	所以有时候，它是逐渐改变的．
And they've made this, what was just a store along a commercial strip, into a community gathering space.	有时候是一次性完成的．
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix, Arizona.	这是另一个在停车场基础上进行填补的项目， 这是一个华盛顿特区外的办公停车场．
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint, a gourmet grocery, and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.	当华盛顿地区的地铁通到市郊 并在这个停车场附近设了一个站台后， 停车场的所有者决定在这 再建一个新的停车场 并在原来的地面停车场的地方 新建一个大街，几栋住宅 和公寓楼， 并同时保留了原来的办公大楼．
Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination.	这是这里1940年时的样子． 那时这里只是一个小的农场 在一个叫作Hyattsville的村庄里．
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.	到1980年，这里已经被分割成了 一边的大的购物商场 和另一边办公园区的花园． 之后又在缓冲区建了图书馆 并在最右边建了一座教堂．
The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim, "Walking distance to Le Grande Orange," because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call "a third place."	现在，公共交通， 主要街道和新的建筑 都已经建好．
If home is the first place and work is the second place, the third place is where you go to hang out and build community.	逐渐地，我想那些街区 很可能会延伸到重新开发的商场去．
And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family, the family households, there's a real hunger for more third places.	关于重新发展在商场上面的 那些大量花园式公寓 的计划已经公布了．
So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category, the next strategy: redevelopment.	公共交通系统是改建的一个主要推动力．
Now, during the boom, there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density, a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.	这是它看起来的样子．
But some of them have been much more incremental.	你能隐约看见那些时髦的新式公寓 建在办公大楼的中间 还有公共空间和新的主要街道．
This is Mashpee Commons, the oldest retrofit that we've found.	这是我最喜欢的一个项目，在Belmar．
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years, built urbanism on top of its parking lots.	我认为他们真的建了一个很吸引人的地方 并且全部用了绿色建筑．
So the black and white photo shows the simple 60's strip shopping center.	楼顶上有大量的光电转换阵列 还有风力发电的涡轮．
And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact, mixed-use New England village, and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side.	这里原来是一个很大的商场 建在一个一百英亩的大街区里．
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.	现在这里有 22个适宜步行的城市街区 和公共街道， 两个公共公园，八条公交线路 以及许多种不同的住宅样式． 所以它真的给了科罗拉多州的Lakewood 一个市中心 一个这个特殊的市郊从来没有的东西．
Sometimes, it's all at once.	这是这个商场在它最繁华的时期．
This is another infill project on the parking lots, this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.	人们在这商场里开舞会，他们都很喜欢这里．
Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville.	这是1975年的样子 商场在里面．
By 1980, it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right.	到1995年，商场荒废了．
Today, the transit, the Main Street and the new housing have all been built.	建筑还留在那． 我们发现这是个很普遍的现象．
Eventually, I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.	百货商场是个多层建筑，他们都建得很好．
Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped.	他们也很容易就能被重新利用．
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.	但如果是一家店挨着一家店的格局...
So here's what it looks like.	就真得变成历史了．
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street.	所以，这里是计划中的样子．
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.	这个项目，我认为和 周边的地区有很大联系．
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction.	它给1500户家庭提供了一种 更城市化的生活方式．
There's massive P.V.	“我们一直在想弄醒他，都有半个小时了。”
arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines.	弗里茨说，“可他睡得像死人一样。”
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock.	当客人们都走了，我和乔、毕蒂心情稍好一些，我们一起吃了顿安静的晚餐。
It's now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets, two public parks, eight bus lines and a range of housing types, and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had.	我决定在铁匠铺过夜，这使乔十分高兴，我对自己提出这样做也感到高兴。
Here was the mall in its heyday.	第二天早晨，一丝风都没有，我们距离岛的东岸还有半英里。尽管阳光灿烂而温暖，我却憎恨这个金银岛，害怕可能发生的一切。
They had their prom in the mall.	教授们意识到我在从事一项重要的工作，因而给了我一间实验室。
They loved their mall.	实验室的上面有一个小的套房，我就住在里面；有时候我一个星期都呆在那座建筑物里不出去。
So here's the site in 1975 with the mall.	戈弗雷认为织布匠太自私了。
By 1995, the mall has died.	“我认为，马南，”他坚决地说，“你得想想怎么样对埃比最好。
The department store has been kept -- and we found this was true in many cases.	我很抱歉，可我想照顾我自己的女儿是我的责任。”
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.	“那就照实收尾。”
They're easy to be re-adapted.	牛子还是不肯吃喝。
But the one story stuff ...	但最糟糕的是他还在发狂。他的头脑还是没有好转……

But where was Silas while this was happening?In the evenings he sometimes used to open his door and look out.He had some idea that his money would come back,or that some-one would come with information about the thief Tonight was New Year's Eve,and the villagers had told him to stay awake until midnight,because it would bring him good luck if he saw the beginning of the new year.So tonight he was more restless than usual.He opened his door several times during the evening,and stared out,but he saw and heard nothing in the silent,freezing night.The last time,as he was standing at the door,he had one of his fits,and stood there completely uncon-scions,holding the door open.	这时西拉斯在哪儿呢？他晚上有时会打开门看看外面，总觉得有一天他的金子会回来，或者什么人会给他带来关于贼的消息。今晚是新年夜，村里人告诉他今天午夜前不要睡觉，因为看着新的一年到来会给人带来好运。所以今晚他比平时更坐立不安。
When he became conscious again,he closed the door and turned back to the fire.But when his shortsighted eyes looked at the floor in front of the fire,he seemed to see gold there!Gold—his own gold—taken and then brought back to him in the same strange way!His heart beat excitedly,and for a few moments he was unable to move.At last he reached out his hand to touch the gold,but instead of hard,metal coins his fin－gers felt soft,warm curls.	最后一次站到门口的时候，他又犯病了，站在那儿完全失去了知觉。门开着。恢复知觉以后，他关上门回到炉火前，但当他的近视眼看到炉前的地板时，他好像发现了金子！金子——他的金子——奇怪地离他而去又以同样的方式奇怪地回到了他的身边！终于他伸手去摸那金子，可是没有摸到硬硬的金币，却摸到了软软的暖暖的鬈发。

I haven't seen Cathy since then.Once I went to the Heights to visit her,but I was not allowed to see her.About six weeks ago I had a long conversation with Zillah,the housekeeper,who gave me news of Cathy.It appeared that,when she ar rived at the Heights,she did her best to look after her sick husband.He was obviously dying,although Heathcliff refused to call the doctor.Only a few weeks after her arrival,Linton died in the night,with only Cathy by his bedside.Heathcliff inherited all of Linton's,and what had been Cathy's,fortune,so Cathy is now very poor.	此后我就没有见过凯茜。看来在凯茜到呼啸山庄后一直尽心尽力照顾她生病的丈夫。很明显他快要死了，尽管如此，希斯克利夫还是不让找大夫。在她到呼啸山庄仅几个星期之后，林顿在夜里死了，当时只有凯茜陪在他床边。希斯克利夫继承了林顿的（原本是凯茜的）所有财产，所以现在凯茜一贫如洗。

During the next few weeks,however,I noticed Cathy's behaviour change.She was always writing on little pieces of paper,which she kept in a locked drawer in her room,and every morning she got up surprisingly early to go down to the kitchen.I suspected something,and day I decided to break open her drawer.In it I was horrified to find a whole pile of love letters from Linton.The two cousins had been writing to each other in secret for several weeks,and Cathy had used the milkman as a messenger.I told her at once that I knew her secret,and made her promise not to send or receive any more letters.We burnt Linton's letters together.	可在过后的几个星期里，我注意到凯茜的举动有些异样。她老是在小纸条上写字，把纸条锁在她房间的抽屉里，每天早晨起床出奇地早，然后下到厨房。我怀疑她在搞什么鬼，于是一天我决定橇开她的抽屉。我震惊地发现里面是一大撂林顿写来的情书。这两个表姐弟偷偷地相互通信已有好几个星期了，凯茜是让送牛奶的替他们捎信。我们一起把林顿的信烧了。

'Well,I advise you to work hard,and hot to look back into your past.If something which we know is wrong tempts us,then we must make every effort to avoid it,by putting our energy to better use.A year ago I too was very miserable,because I was bored by the routine life of a country vicar,and I was tempted to change my profession.But suddenly there was light in my darkness,and God called me to be a missionary.No profession could be greater than that!Since that moment of truth,I have been perfectly happy,making my preparations for leaving England and going abroad in the service of God.Happy,that is,except for one little human weakness,which I have sworn to overcome.'	“那么我建议你努力工作，不要去回首往事。一年前我也非常痛苦，因为乡村牧师的单调生活让我感到厌倦，我起了换个工作的念头。然而黑暗中突然出现了光明，上帝召唤我去做一名传教士。没有什么职业比这更伟大了！从那个真理显现的时刻起，我就一直非常快乐，准备着离开英格兰，到国外去为上帝效力。这就是快乐，除此之外，我还有一个人性的小弱点需要克服。”

One night in London,nearly a year later, a servant girlwas sitting at her bedroom window, looking out at themoonlit street.	差不多一年以后，一天晚上在伦敦，一个女仆坐在她卧室的窗台边，看着洒满月光的街道。
