This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.	大卫.盖罗：这位是比尔.兰格， 我是大卫.盖罗。
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.	我们将用一些影片来讲述一些深海里的故事。
We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen, and we're not going to show you any of it.	我们这有不少精彩的泰坦尼克的影片， 可惜您今天看不到。
The truth of the matter is that the Titanic -- even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records -- it's not the most exciting story from the sea.	泰坦尼克号 是拿了不少票房冠军 但事实上它并不是关于海洋的最刺激的故事。
And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.	原因在于我们一直没把海洋当回事儿。
When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.	大家想想，海洋占了地球面积的75％。
Most of the planet is ocean water.	地球的大部分都是海水。
The average depth is about two miles.	海洋的平均深度是两英里
Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach, or we see images like this of the ocean, and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides, but you have no idea for what lies in there.	当你站在海滩上 或是当你看到海洋里的图像， 当你看着这么一大片蓝色，它泛着光， 不断地变动着，一会儿是海浪，一会儿是波涛， 一会儿又涨潮， 你却不知道它里面到底有些什么。
And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.	其实地球上最长的山脉都在海洋里。
Most of the animals are in the oceans.	大部分的动物也都生活在海洋里。
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea, at the bottom of the sea.	大多数地震和火山喷发也都发生在海洋里 在海洋的最底部。
The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places, than it is in the rainforests.	海洋里生物的多样性和密度要比 雨林带还高。
It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.	这儿基本上都没有被开发过，但是像这些美丽的景色， 它吸引着我们并被我们所熟知。
But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.	但我想告诉你的是，当你站在海边时， 你面对的是一个完全陌生的世界。
We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world.	我们得用非常特殊的仪器 才能到达那个陌生的世界。
We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras, and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.	我们用的是深海潜水艇Alvin号和摄像机， 摄像机是比尔.兰格和索尼共同研发的。
Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."	马塞尔.普鲁斯特说过：真正的探索之旅 不是为了新的发现，而是为了找到新的视角。
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes, not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself.	和我们合作的人们帮我们找到了新的视角， 我们不仅看到了哪些已经存在的 那些深海里的景观， 同时我们也重新认识了生命本身。
Here's a jelly.	这是一只水母。
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.	是我最喜欢的，因为它哪都能动。
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.	原来它是海洋中最长的生物。
It gets up to about 150 feet long.	它可以伸展到150英尺长。
But see all those different working things?	看到这些在动的东西了吗？
I love that kind of stuff.	我真喜欢这些东西。
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom.	底下这些都是鱼饵。
They're going up and down.	它们上上下下的浮动。
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.	还有这些摇晃着，旋转着的触角。
It's a colonial animal.	这是一种群栖动物。
These are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature.	其实它们都是由单独的动物， 结合在一起就成了这样大的一个生物。
And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment, and a little light.	还有前面的这个是推进引擎。 它一会儿会用到它，还有一些光。
If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that, put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals on the other side, those guys win hands down.	如果你把所有的鱼类， 放在天平的一端，然后把所有水母状的动物 放在另一端，水母那边要重的多。
Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.	大多数的海洋生物都是由这类生物。
Here's the X-wing death jelly.	这只是x翼死亡水母。
The bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating.	它们用这种生物荧光来吸引伴侣， 食物和交流。
We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.	我们没办法从我们档案中的水母介绍起。
They come in all different sizes and shapes.	它们大小不同，形状各异。
We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.	比尔.兰格：我们通常忘了海洋平均有好几英里深， 我们对于 两三百尺深处的动物很了解， 但从那往下就不太知道了。
And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space, that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.	而像这样的动物 就生活在 我们没有探索过的微重力的三维空间里。
You hear about giant squid and things like that, but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.	你一定听说过巨型章鱼之类的东西。 但像这样的动物可以伸张到140到160英尺长。
They're very little understood.	它们还没有被研究透。
This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.	大卫：这也是其中之一，是我们另一个最爱，一个小的八爪鱼。
You can actually see through his head.	你真的能看穿它的脑袋。
And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.	它的耳朵在上下摆动，还很优雅地向上游着。
We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.	我们能在不同深度，甚至最深处看到这样的动物。
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.	它们有的几英尺长，有的几尺长。
They come right up to the submarine -- they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.	它们有的会贴近潜水艇－－ 它们的眼睛会贴着潜水艇的窗口向里看。
This is really a world within a world, and we're going to show you two.	这里的世界中还有另一个世界， 我们将给您介绍两个。
In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.	像这一个，当我们到达了中海一下就能看见像这样子的物种。
This is kind of like an undersea rooster.	它看起来有点像深海里的公鸡。
This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.	看这个，它看起来真的太正经了。
And then one of my favorites.	还有这也是我的最爱之一。
What a face!	看这张脸！
This is basically scientific data that you're looking at.	你们看到的这些基本上都是科学数据。
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.	它们都是我们为了科学研究而收集的影片。
And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing, is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this, in the world where they belong.	这个是比尔正在做的， 为了让科学家们看到这些第一手材料 这些在它们生存的环境中获取的。
They don't catch them in a net.	他们不会用鱼网来捕这些生物。
They're actually looking at them down in that world.	他们会在它们的世界中观察它们。
We're going to take a joystick, sit in front of our computer, on the Earth, and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.	我们会用一个控制杆， 在地面上我们只用坐在电脑前， 移动控制杆就能环游地球了。
We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge, a 40,000-mile long mountain range.	现在我们看一个海中央的山脊。 一个40，000英里长的山脉。
The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.	这些山脉顶端的平均深度都有1.5英里。
And we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there -- but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America, and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.	我们已走遍了大西洋－－那就是山脊， 现在我们要穿过加勒比海，中美洲， 最后到达太平洋，北纬九度。
We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar, and this is one of those mountain ranges.	我们用声纳来制作这些山脊的地图， 这是这些山脊中的一个。
We're coming around a cliff here on the right.	我们现在向右转过一个悬崖。
The height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases.	这些山脉两侧山谷的高度 大多数都比阿尔卑斯山脉还要高。
And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.	这里还有成千上万的山脉不在地图上。
This is a volcanic ridge.	这是一个火山脊。
We're getting down further and further in scale.	我们现在往更深处走。
And eventually, we can come up with something like this.	最终我们会看到像这样的东西。
This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.	这是最具代表性的一个机器人－他叫杰森。
And you can sit in a room like this, with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time.	你会坐在这样的一间房间里， 用遥控杆和耳机来这样驾驶机器人 同时机器人在海底行走。
One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.	在伍兹霍尔，我们还希望和我们的合伙人 把这个虚拟的世界－－ 这个未曾背发掘的地带－带回实验室里。
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.	因为我们现在看到的都是些点滴片断。
We see it either as sound, or we see it as video, or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors, but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.	我们获取了一些声音，一些影象， 或是一些图片，或是一些化学成分 －－但我们从没把它们放在一块来看。
Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine.	这里是比尔的相机真正出彩的地方。
This is what's called a hydrothermal vent.	我们叫这个热泉喷出口。
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed, hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.	您现在看到的是一团密度很高的 强硫化氫液体 从海底的火山中轴喷出。
Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.	有时可以达到600到700华氏度。
So that's all water under the sea -- a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.	这些都是海水中的液体－ 一点五英里，两英里，三英里深。
And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.	六七十年代时我们只知道这是一座火山。
And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism, water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor, come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.	后来我们发现了这些物质 存在于它的轴心周围，因为假如你知道这里有火山运动， 这些液体会流向海底并且进入海床的裂缝， 和岩浆汇合，然后喷出热浪。
We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.	我们真没想到硫化氢的含量会这么高。
We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.	我们当初根本不知道这些是什么，我们叫它们烟囱。
This is one of these hydrothermal vents.	这是这些热液出口中的一个。
Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.	300多度的液体从地里涌出。
On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps, so the setting here is very dramatic.	我们两侧的山脊都比阿尔卑斯山高， 所以说这的地形是惊人的。
The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees C.	比尔：这些白色的物质是一种细菌 它能在180度的高温下生存。
I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea, is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria.	大卫：现在我们要讲一个最不可思议的故事 我们现在看到的是 我们最开始看到的从海底冒出来的 火山喷发后的细菌。
And we started to wonder for a long time, how did it all get down there?	我们开始想 它为什么在那里？
What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.	我们现在知道它可能是来自地球内部。
Not only is it coming out of the Earth -- so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life.	它不仅从地球里出来－－ 它的生物源来自于火山活动－－ 但这些细菌供养群居在这里的生物。
The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.	这里的压力是平均每平方英尺4000磅。
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here.	离地表一点五英里，两三英里深 没有任何阳光的照射。
All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.	支撑所有的生命形式的能量 都来自地球内部－那些化学合成物。

These are called tube worms.	它们被叫做管道蠕虫。
These worms have no digestive system.	比尔：这些蠕虫没有消化系统。
They have no mouth.	它们没有嘴。
But they have two types of gill structures.	但它们有两种腮组织。
One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water, another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria, which takes the hydrothermal fluid -- that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom -- and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.	一种可以从深海液体中吸收氧气， 另一种吞近这些 靠热液生存的化合细菌 就是这些从海底冒出来的热水－－ 然后再转化成管道蠕虫可以消化的简单糖份。
You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.	大卫：你可以看到－这是一只生活在这里的螃蟹。
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms.	它能钳住蠕虫的一小部分。
Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.	它们通常一碰到螃蟹就缩回去。
Oh!	恩！
Good going.	厉害。
So, as soon as a crab touches them, they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.	所以，一旦螃蟹碰到它们 它们就缩回壳里，就像指甲。
There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology.	这样的故事被一一展开 我们只是开始对它们有些认识 全都靠这个新的摄影技术。
These worms live in a real temperature extreme.	比尔：这些蠕虫都生活在这样极端的温度下。
Their foot is at about 200 degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C, so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.	它们的脚有大概200度 它们的头是3度左右， 这就像是你的手放在沸水中而你的脚在冰水里。

Here they go.	看这里。
On one of the last dive series, we counted 200 species in these areas -- 198 were new, new species.	在过去的潜水系列中有一次 我们在这个区域里找到200种物种。 198种都是新的物种。
One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.	比尔：对生物学家来说最大的问题之一 是在这些地点工作，更不用说采集物种。
And they disintegrate on the way up, so the imagery is critical for the science.	因为采集上来它们就会破裂， 所以这些影像对科学来说是至关重要的。
Two octopods at about two miles depth.	大卫：这是两条在两英里深处的章鱼。
This pressure thing really amazes me -- that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.	这里的压力真的让我很吃惊， 这些动物居然可以在这样的深度生存 这里的压力足够把泰坦尼克号压成一只空百事可乐罐。

They're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.	它们会粘在岩石的表面 并从岩石表面把细菌扒下来。
Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.	这里有一个很小的出口在那个很大的柱子上。
Those pillars get up to several stories.	这些柱子可以有几层楼高。
So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.	现在你可以看到这样一个难以置信景色鬼魅的峡谷 这里有在这样的柱子，热泉，火山喷发和地震， 这些奇异的动物就生活在这里 靠地里冒出的化学能量为生。

It's actually a light-sensing organ.	它们实际上是感光器官。
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents.	它们就是靠它来找到热液出口。
The vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an IR signature -- and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.	这些出口发射出一种黑体的辐射－一种红外线－ 所以它们能在很远的距离外找到这些出口
All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today, as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.	大卫：所有这些都发生在40000英里长的山脊周围 我们称之为生命带，即使是今天， 此时此刻，生命正诞生于火山活动中。
This is the first time we've ever tried this any place.	这是我们在这里的第一次尝试。

There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites.	有很多科学小组都认为 生命是从这些热液喷口开始进化的。
Although the vent sites are short-lived -- an individual site may last only 10 years or so -- as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions -- well, billions -- of years.	尽管这些喷口的存在时间很短－－ 大概每个只能延续10年左右－－ 但作为一个生态系统，它们已经很稳定地存在了几百万，甚至几十亿年。

Radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education.	学校教育的全方位开放 目前还是一件可望而不可及的事。
We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity.	我们历尽艰辛才弄明白 学习不是一个在哪学的问题，而是一项活动。
But I want to tell you the story of PISA, OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds around the world, and it's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy.	以下我要给大家介绍一下PISA（国际学生评估方案）， 这个方案是OECD用来测量世界上 15岁孩子们知识和技能的测试方案， 这一测试方案向我们展示了国与国之间的教育比较 是如何把原本是一国内政事务的教育领域 全球化的。
Look at how the world looked in the 1960s, in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school.	我们先从高中毕业生的比例这一标的 来看看20世纪60年代世界各国的教育 是什么样子的。
You can see the United States ahead of everyone else, and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education.	我们可以看到，美国遥遥领先排在首位， 而美国所取得的经济成就在很大程度上 得益于其长期 作为教育先行者的教育强国地位。
But in the 1970s, some countries caught up.	到了70年代，有些国家赶上来了，
In the 1980s, the global expansion of the talent pool continued.	到80年代，全球性的 人才扩展持续。
And the world didn't stop in the 1990s.	90年代，世界各国教育的发展并没停步。
So in the '60s, the U.S. was first.	所以，在60年代，美国教育排第一。
In the '90s, it was 13th, and not because standards had fallen, but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.	到90年代，其排名第13位， 其排名的下降，不是因为其本身的教育水准降低了， 而是因为别国的教育水平大大提高了。
Korea shows you what's possible in education.	韩国教育的经验向我们展示了教育的无限可能性。
Two generations ago, Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today, and was one of the lowest education performers.	两代人以前，韩国的生活水平 跟今天的阿富汗一样 其教育水平也是全球表现最差国之一。
Today, every young Korean finishes high school.	而今天，韩国普及了高中教育。
So this tells us that, in a global economy, it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success, but the best performing education systems internationally.	这告诉我们，在全球经济中， 衡量一国教育成功的基准不再只局限于本国的进步， 而是要将其放到国际上最好的教育系统中去进行比对才有意义。
The trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do.	可问题是 测量一个人在学校花的时间的多少 或者他们取得什么样的学位 并不能判断其实际工作能力。
Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets, while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need.	目前的情况是，大街上到处都是失业的毕业生 而雇主却说他们招不到 他们所需要的专业技术人材。
And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives.	这说明拥有好的学位并不等于会拥有相应的 好技能、好工作和美好生活。
So with PISA, we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly.	所以我们想运用PISA方法， 直接测量人们的知识和技能 以此来改变这种现象。
And we took a very special angle to this.	我们对此采取了一个非常特殊的视角。
We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school, but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations.	我们对学生是否能简单地 复制他们在学校里学到的知识不很感兴趣， 我们想测试的是他们能否运用 他们已学的知识来进行推理 并将新知识运用到解决末知领域的问题中去。
Now, some people have criticized us for this.	可有人因此批评我们。
They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people, because we test students with problems they haven't seen before.	他们说，这种测量得出的结果 对人们是非常不公平的，因为我们用 学生们以前没见过的问题来测试他们。
But if you take that logic, you know, you should consider life unfair, because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school, but whether we are prepared for change, whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created, to use technologies that haven't been invented, to solve problems we just can't anticipate today.	但是，如果按这种逻辑 你会认为，人生十分的不公平， 对生活的真理的检验，不在于我们是否能记住了多少 我们在学校里学的东西， 而在于我们是否作好了随时应变的准备、 在于我们是否已经作好了从事那些 需要使用还没有发明的技术 去解决我们今天还没无预料的问题的新工作岗位的准备。
And once hotly contested, our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.	经过激烈的争议， 我们测量的结果却很快成为公认的标准。
In our latest assessment in 2009, we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy.	在2009的最新评估中， 我们测评了74个学校系统， 这些被测国的经济总量占全球经济总量的87%。
This chart shows you the performance of countries.	这个图展示了这些国家的表现。
In red, sort of below OECD average.	红色表示稍低于OECD的平均值。
Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.	黄色代表一般般，绿色的国家做的很好。
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia; Finland in Europe; Canada in North America doing really well.	你可以看到，亚洲的上海，南韩，新加坡； 欧洲的芬兰； 和北美的加拿大都做的很好。
You can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile, and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance.	从表中明显一个巨大的差距在于： 在受教育程度方面， 在15岁年龄阶层，上海的孩子比和智利孩子平均多受了3年半的教育, 如果算上其它教育更落后的国家， 这个差距将达到7个学年。
There's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today's economy.	现在的年青人 对现代经济所做的准备也存在着巨大的差异。
But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture.	我想在这讲一下我们评估的 第二个重要依据。
Educators like to talk about equity.	教育家们喜欢讨论公平。
With PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity, in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances.	我们就用PISA来测试他们是如何做到教育公平， 也就是如何确保学生 无论其来自哪种不同的社会背景都有均等的受教育机会。
And we see that in some countries, the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very, very strong.	我们看到在有些国家， 学生的社会背景对其受教育机会的影响 非常巨大。
Opportunities are unequally distributed.	由于受教育机会的不均等。
A lot of potential of young children is wasted.	很多小孩子的潜能没有得到开发而被埋没了。
We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born.	在其他一些国家，学生的社会背景 对其受教育的机会没有太大的影响。
We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant, where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.	很多国家都想挤进右上象限里去， 因为一象限代表着这些国家的教育业绩很好，学习机会分配均等。
Nobody, and no country, can afford to be there, where performance is poor and there are large social disparities.	在教育落后地区， 没有任何个人和国家能进入优良教育象限， 这造成了社会教育的巨大不公平。
And then we can debate, you know, is it better to be there, where performance is strong at the price of large disparities?	这样我们就能辩论， 我们是应该为了一国的教育成就 而牺牲学生受教育的公平机会？
Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?	还是我们要注重教育的公平性而接受平庸呢？
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture, you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity.	事实上，看一看这张图上出现的国家的教育成就， 可以看到很多国家实际上 做到了优秀和平等的统一。
In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence.	事实上，从这个比较得到的最重要的教训之一 就是你不必为了达到优秀 而向平等妥协。
These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all, a very important lesson.	这些国家已经走出了由为部分人提供优质教育 到为所有人提供优质教育的发展之路， 这是个很重要的教训。
And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people.	这也挑战了很多学校体系 一贯主张的教育的功能就是要将人分为三六九等的思维模式.
And ever since those results came out, policymakers, educators, researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what's behind the success of those systems.	自从这些结果出现后， 来自世界各地的决策者，教育家，研究人员 都在试图搞清楚 这些教育系统成功的背后是什么。
But let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA, and I'm giving them a colored bubble now.	让我们先回顾一下 关注实际开始了PISA的这些国家， 我用彩色的泡泡来表示这些国家。
And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students.	我用不同的大小 比例 来表示这些国家花在学生身上的钱。
If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes, you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?	如果教育投入的钱能够解释 学生学习的质量， 那照理在上面的那些国家的泡泡应该都很大才对，不是吗？
But that's not what you see.	但你看到的却不是。
Spending per student only explains about, well, less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries, and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system, doesn't do particularly well.	生均教育经费投入 对一个国家教育质量的影响 大约不足20%， 例如，卢森堡是教育投入是最高的， 但其教育效果并不太好。
What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results.	我们看到的是，两个经费投入相似的国家 可以取得完全不同的成就。
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson.	你也看到--我认为也是最鼓舞人的发现之一-- 我们居住的世界不是很一刀切地划分成 富有和教育程度高的国家， 与贫穷和教育程度很差的国家， 这是个很重要的教训。
Let's look at this in greater detail.	让我们看一些细节。
The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth.	这个红点表示 生均教育经费投入与一国财富的关系。
One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well, and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession.	一种投放方法是提高老师工资， 韩国在这方面投入大量资金 来吸引好的优秀的人才加入教育行列。
And Korea also invests into long school days, which drives up costs further.	同时，韩国延长了学校时间， 此举进一步拉高教育投入。
Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop.	最后，韩国要求他们的老师 不但要教好书，还要做好个人的职业发展。
They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things.	他们在教师的职业发展与协作 和其它很多方面投入资金。
All that costs money.	所有这些都得花钱。
How can Korea afford all of this?	韩国怎么付得起呢？
The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.	答案是，韩国学校实行大班额教学。
This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.	从这根蓝棒可以看出，此举大大降低了办学费用。
You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg, and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea, so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.	看下一个国家，卢森堡 这个红点的位置和代表韩国的红点位置差不多， 所以，卢森堡和韩国的生均教育经费是一样的。
But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes.	但你看，卢森堡的家长、老师甚至决策者们 都喜欢小班教学。
You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.	走进小课堂时很令人愉快。
So they have invested all their money into there, and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.	所以他们把钱花在那里了， 从这根蓝棒可以看出，小班教学使办学经费大幅增加。
But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once, and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well.	但就算是卢森堡这样的国家，其教育经费的投入也只能是一次性的， 而这种投入模式的代价是： 老师的收入不太好。
Students don't have long hours of learning.	学生在校学习时间不长。
And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.	基本上，老师除了教学没时间做别的。
So you can see two countries spent their money very differently, and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.	所以你看到两个国家花钱不同， 实际上他们如何花钱的影响 远远超过他们在教育上投入的金额。
Let's go back to the year 2000.	我们来看看2000年。
Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.	还记得吧？那是在iPod发明之前的一年。
This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance.	如果用其PISA的表现来看， 当时各国的教育是这个样子的。
The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?	这些泡泡当时还很小，不是吗？
We spent a lot less on education, about 35 percent less on education.	我们在教育方面的投入也少得多， 只占不到35%。
So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive, has it become so much better?	扪心自问，既然教育都变得如此昂贵了， 它变得更好了吗？
And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries.	一个严酷的事实是， 并没有很多国家取得相应的成就。
But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements.	但是有一些国家 已经取得了可喜的改善。
Germany, my own country, in the year 2000, featured in the lower quadrant, below average performance, large social disparities.	2000年我的祖国---德国 被划在较低的象限里， 比平均表现还低，社会差距很大。
And remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.	别忘了，若只按拥有学位的人数来算， 德国曾是教育强国之一。
Very disappointing results.	现在的结果却令人失望。
People were stunned by the results.	测评结果也令人吃惊。
And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education, not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education was the center of the public debate.	几个月以来，教育而不是税务和其他的话题， 成了德国公开辩论的热门话题 这是史无前例的。 教育成了公共辩论的中心话题。
And then policymakers began to respond to this.	接着决策者开始有了回应。
The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.	联邦政府大幅度提高教育投入。
A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.	做了很多有利于 有移民或不良社会背景学生的事情。
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies, but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education.	更有意思的是，这不仅 优化了现有政策， 还改变了德国教育的 一些信仰和规范。
For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten.	譬如，传统上，幼儿教育 被视作家庭的事，很多时候 当妇女把孩子送去幼儿园 被视为疏忽职守。
PISA has transformed that debate, and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany.	PISA改变了这场争论， 促使德国把儿童早期教育纳入了 公共政策的中心。
Or traditionally, the German education divides children at the age of 10, very young children, between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers, and that mainly along socioeconomic lines, and that paradigm is being challenged now too.	传统上，德国教育 在孩子10岁时，非常年幼的时候，就划分成 从事知识职业的工作者 和为知识工作者工作的两大群体， 这基本上与社会经济分工一致， 这个范例现在也在受挑战。
A lot of change.	很多的改变。
And the good news is, nine years later, you can see improvements in quality and equity.	有个好消息是，九年后， 你会看到教学质量和公平性的改进。
People have taken up the challenge, done something about it.	人们已经接受了挑战并采取了一些措施。
Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.	看这个范围的另一头韩国
In the year 2000, Korea did already very well, but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.	在2000年，韩国已经很好了， 但韩国人担心 只有一小部分学生达到了很优秀的水平。
They took up the challenge, and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.	他们接受了挑战， 在十年间，韩国能将 阅读能力优秀学生的比例提高了一倍。
Well, if you only focus on your brightest students, you know what happens is disparities grow, and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction, but still, an impressive improvement.	如果你只是专注于最出色的学生， 差距就会产生， 这个泡泡稍微往右偏移， 但还是有令人印象深刻的改进。
A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools, turn around many of the lowest-performing schools, and raise performance by over half a school year.	波兰教育的主要革新 在于大幅度减少学校间的差异， 使很多表现不佳的学校得到重生， 并在半年时间内就提高了教学业绩。
And you can see other countries as well.	其他一些国家也一样。
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system, raise quality and improve equity, and so did Hungary.	葡萄牙是能够巩固其分散的学校系统， 提高质量和改善公平性， 另外，匈牙利也做到了。
So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.	所以确实能看到，很多的改变。
And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture, of economic factors, of social issues, of homogeneity of societies, and so on, these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.	即使那些抱怨的人说 那些相对有名次的国家 PISA只是文化的产物， 经济因素和社会的产物， 以及社会一致化的产物，等等， 这些人现在必须承认教育改良是可能。
You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.	波兰并没有改变它的文化。
It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population.	没有改变它的经济， 没有改变人口的组成。
It didn't fire its teachers.	没有解雇老师。
It changed its education policies and practice.	它改变了教育政策 和实践。
Very impressive.	却非常引人注目。
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity, high levels of performance, and raised outcomes?	所有这些给我们带来了新的命题： 我们能从这些在绿色象限的国家学到什么？ 谁取得了高水平的业绩和提高了成果？
And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere?	当然，问题是，在一个环境下有效的 在别的地方能用做典范吗？
Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale, but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share.	很显然，你不能把一国的教育体系生搬硬套到别国去， 但这些比较也确实帮我们找出了 所有高效能的教育系统的共性因素。
Everybody agrees that education is important.	人人都同意教育很重要。
Everybody says that.	人人都这样说。
But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority against other priorities?	但问题是，你如何做到， 两害相权取其轻，两利相权取其重呢？
How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers?	各国应如何支付他们的教师工资 和其他高级技术工人的工资呢？
Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer?	你想让你的孩子成为老师 而不是律师吗？
How do the media talk about schools and teachers?	媒体应该如何报道学校和老师呢？
Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems, the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education, their future, more than consumption today.	这些都是关键问题。而我们从PISA看到: 在高性能的教育体系里， 领袖们已经说服市民 重视教育，重视个人前途， 而不应该只着眼当前的消费。
And you know what's interesting?	在这过程中有一些很有趣的事。
You won't believe it, but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school.	说出来令人难以相信， 在很多国家，最吸引人的地方 不是购物中心而是学校。
Those things really exist.	而事实确实如此。
But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture.	高度重视教育 只是其中的一方面。
The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success.	另一方面，这是基于一种信念： 所有的孩子都有能力成功。
You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages.	有些国家 学生们很年幼时就被实施分层教学。
You know, students are divided up, reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world-class standards.	学生们被分开， 这反映了他们的信念： 只有部分小子能达到世界一流的学业水准。
But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.	但通常是有很强的社会不公有关系。
If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe, parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed, and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.	如果你去亚洲的日本，或欧洲的芬兰， 这些国家的父母和老师们 期待每个学生都成功， 你会看到这些都会在学生的行为上表现出来。
When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics, students in North America would typically tell us, you know, it's all about talent.	当我们问学生 在数学上什么算是成功 北美的学生一般会告诉我们， 就是天分啦。
If I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.	如果我生来就不是数学天才，我最好去学别的。
Nine out of 10 Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort, and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.	10个中有9个日本学生会说 这要看我的付出和努力， 这些都反映了他们所在的教育系统的理念。
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways.	过去，不同的学生受教方法相似。
High performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices.	PISA中的业绩突出者 用有因材施教的方法来接纳多元性。
They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents, and they personalize learning opportunities.	他们意识到 普通的学生也有杰出的天分， 他们把学习机会个性化。
High-performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.	高性能系统也普遍认同 整个范围中的明确和有抱负的标准。
Every student knows what matters.	学生们都知道什么重要。
Every student knows what's required to be successful.	学生们都知道成功需要什么。
And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers.	没有一个地方教育系统的质量 超过老师的质量。
High-performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them.	高性能的系统很小心地 招聘和选择老师 并培训他们。
They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling, and how they structure teacher pay.	他们留意如何帮助那些 在困境中挣扎的老师提高教学效率， 和如何去核定老师的工资。
They provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice.	他们提供一个老师们能团结工作的环境 去构架好的做法。
And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers.	他们为老师提供各种途径 促进教师的职业成长。
In bureaucratic school systems, teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.	在官僚的学校体系中， 老师常常被孤零零留在教室里照本宣科 因为教师们被很多的法规束缚着教与不教什么。
High-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.	高效能的系统很清楚什么样的表现是好的。
They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable their teachers to figure out, what do I need to teach to my students today?	他们设定雄心勃勃的标准， 但他们能让老师们去想办法弄清楚， 我今天需要给我的学生教什么。
The past was about delivered wisdom in education.	过去教育是传递知识和智慧的桥梁。
Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.	而现在挑战在于让学生自己学习其所需的智慧。
High performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control -- sort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education -- to professional forms of work organization.	高效率的执行者已经从职业或责任控制的管理者 转变成了专业的工作机构。 就好像，你如何检测 人们是否做了他们应该做的事
They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.	他们鼓励老师们在教学中勇于创新。
They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices.	他们为老师提供其所需的发展机会 去制定更有力的教学方式。
The goal of the past was standardization and compliance.	以往的目标是标准化和服从。
High-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive.	高效率的体系让老师 和校长们富有独创性。
In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes, on provision.	以前，政策专注于结果， 专注于条规。
The high-performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher, the next school around their lives.	高效率的体系帮助老师和 校长们放眼于他们人生中的下一个老师， 下一个学校。
And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system.	世界级系统的最令人印象深刻的结果是 他们在整个系统中实现了高性能。
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA, but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools.	你以看到芬兰在PISA中做的挺好， 但芬兰给人留下深刻印象的是 只有5%的学生的表现 在这些学校当中有变化。

They make them coherent over sustained periods of time, and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.	他们使之持续连贯， 确保始终如一地执行。
Now, knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve.	知道了成功的系统怎么做的 并没有告诉我们如何改进。
That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are.	也很清楚，这就是PISA国际比较 的一些极限。
That's where other forms of research need to kick in, and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing.	也是其他形式的研究需要介入， 也是为什么PISA不冒险介入 告诉这些国家它们应该做什么。
But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing.	但PISA的长处在于告诉他们 别人都做了些什么。
And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems.	PISA的例子显示 数据比我们常用的通过运行教育系统 行政管理财务补贴更有威力。
You know, some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards.	有人会提出 改变教育行政管理 就像移动墓地。

Thank you.	谢谢大家！
I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper.	今天我想跟大家说说 有关于报纸头条新闻背后的 科学家们所付出的努力
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.	事关气候变化时，报纸头版是这样的 这个是关于空气质量和烟雾的头条
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.	它们是大气科学的两个分支
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system.	这是最近的报纸头条， 当时，联合国政府间气候变化专门委员会，即IPCC 发布了一份针对理解大气系统形势的报告
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.	这份报告由来自40个国家的 共620名科学家撰写
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic.	在这个主题上，他们倾注了近一千页的努力
And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers, from 113 countries.	同时，来自113个国家的400多位科学家 和观察员审读了整份报告
It's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.	这是一个很大的群体， 事实上，我们年会是全球物理学界最大的会议
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that.	每年开会时，逾15000名科学家云集洛杉矶
And every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics.	他们中的每一个都代表着一个研究小组 以及每个小组的大量研究课题
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I happen to study.	在剑桥，我们的研究方向各式各样 有影响天气和气候的厄尔尼诺现象 有卫星数据同化 还有生产生物燃料的农作物的排放，这也是我正好在研究的
And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules.	在每一个研究领域里，当然远不止这些 都有像我这样的博士生 我们都在研究非常狭窄的课题 窄到只是寥寥几个反应或者几个分子
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it.	我正在研究其中一种叫异戊二烯的分子 大家看，是种小有机分子，你们可能从未听过
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene.	一个回形针的质量大约等同于 10的21次方个异戊二烯分子
And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system.	正因如此，这种分子对大气系统举足轻重
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.	这是位于西班牙的EUPHORE装置的烟雾室
Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car.	分子在大气中经过充分的燃烧 这个过程所花费的时间比在你车里反应所花的长15000倍
But still, we look at the pieces.	即便如此，我们仍然观察反应结果
We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do.	我们在超级计算机上运行大量的模型 这正好是我在干的事
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.	我们的模型里有成百上千的网格 每个网格在分钟级的时间尺度上计算成百个变量
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations.	我们花费数周的时间整合数据
And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.	为了理解究竟发生了什么， 我们进行数十次的整合
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing.	同时，我们在世界各地搜寻这种物质
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others.	最近我在马来西亚参加了一个野外研究项目，别处也有类似的项目
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there, in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene, and of course, other things while we were there.	我们在当地雨林里建立了一个全球大气监视塔 我们在塔上悬挂了 价值数十万美元的科学设备 这是都是为了探测异戊二烯分子 当然，也可以探测别的存在的东西
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest, from above.	这就是雨林中的那座塔，这是从上看
And this is the tower from below.	再从下方看看
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us.	在上次的野外考察中我们还动用了
And this plane, the model, BA146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people.	FAAM旗下的BA146型飞机 这种飞机通常客容量在120至130人之间
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.	也许在座的各位今天就是搭乘类似的飞机到达会场的
But we didn't just fly it.	但科学家的工作可不只是搭乘飞机这样简单。
We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff.	 为了测量这种分子飞机的飞行高度离森林中天棚似的树荫仅为100米--很危险
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements.	为了进行测量，飞机要保持在一个特殊的飞行角度
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering.	为此我们请来军事和飞机试驾飞行员来驾驶飞机
We have to get special flight clearance.	此外我们还准备了特殊飞行许可
And as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs.	当飞机一路从河谷飞过，阻力就已高达2G
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board.	要进行测量 科学家们就一定要在机舱里进行控制
So, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation.	想象一下 我们的飞机机舱可不是普通飞机可以媲美的
It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule.	它是测量分子的空中实验室
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule.	这是我们为了解化学分子所进行的努力
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject.	像我一样的学生们要是对某一分子情有独钟 或有独到见解 就会把自己的看法写成科学论文
And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules.	然后对那几十种分子的研究就会积累 几十篇文章
And as a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others.	这样知识体系就构建起来了 次级学科，或次次级学科就形成了 包括IPCC在内，我们有很多这样的研究
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.	IPCC的11个章节中 都有六至十个次级学科
So you can imagine the scale of the effort.	科学的努力付出可见一斑
In each one of those assessments that we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience.	我们的每一篇研究报告 都会有一个 为普通大众所写的摘要
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers, in order to make headlines like these.	然后摘要就交给记者和政策制定者 新闻报道的标题就形成了
Thank you very much.	非常感谢
Hi.	嗨，请大家跟我一样将你的双手举起来回摆动。
I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back, just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.	 就像我这样，有点像皇室出巡向人民挥手致敬般的摆动。
You can mimic what you can see.	你可以直接模仿我的挥动方式。
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.	你可以安排你手臂中的上百条肌肉运作。
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program, control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.	很快的你就可以看到你脑部内的运作方式， 编程、控制着脑部里各个不同区块的运作。
I'm going to tell you about that technology.	我现在就要来告诉大家这项技术
People have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain, for thousands of years.	人类数千年来都想一窥心智的内部运作 人的脑部运作。
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.	如今在这科技发达年代的我们有机会去达成它。
People envision this as being very difficult.	人们总认为这会是一向艰难的挑战。
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.	因为你必须要将太空梭缩小后注射入人体的血管中。
It was terribly dangerous.	这是极度危险的事情。
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.	你可能会被动脉中的白血球攻击。
But now, we have a real technology to do this.	但现在我们真的有这样的技术去做这项研究。
We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.	我们将要进入我同事彼得的脑中。
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.	且是用非侵入性的方法，那就是使用核磁共振造影。
We don't have to inject anything.	不必注入任何东西进入体内。
We don't need radiation.	不需要冒着辐射的危害。
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body -- but more importantly, we can look into his mind.	就能够进入彼得的脑部的解剖结构中，确确实实地飞入他的体内。 但更重要的是我们可以观察他的心智运作。
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.	当彼得挥动他的手臂，你可以看那个黄色的点 是彼得脑中对应功能发生运作的地方。
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms, that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.	你们之前已经看过了，你可以透过电极控制机械手臂， 脑部成像及扫瞄器可以显示出你大脑内部。
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.	最新的进展是原本这个程序一般需经过几天甚至是几个月的分析。
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.	我们现在用最新技术可将时间缩短至几毫秒钟而已， 且当彼德在扫描器中可以同时看到自己的脑部运作。

If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.	如果你烧到自己一定会马上缩手。
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time, it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.	但如果你痛持续了6个月或6年， 这是因为这些神经回路产生的疼痛感对你不再具有帮助。
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain, we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information, and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.	如果我们可以观察大脑产生这些痛苦的活动情况， 我们便可以制作3D模型并即时观察大脑处理信息的方式， 我们就能够找出产生疼痛的区域。
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.	把你手臂放在背后并使二头肌收缩。
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing.	现在，想象你将很快能够看到你的大脑的内部 并选择脑部的区块去做同样的事。
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.	你所看到的是我们已经找出一位慢性疼痛病人的大脑途径。
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.	也许你会觉得不可思议，但我们现在正即时且逐字逐句地读这个人的大脑。
They're watching their own brain activation, and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.	他们正看着自己的大脑活动， 而且他们控制产生痛苦的途径。
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.	他们正在学习去调节这个路径，可使他们不必再服用止痛剂。

When they control their brain, they can control their pain.	当他们控制自己的大脑，便可控制他们的痛苦。
This is an investigational technology, but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.	这是一个研究中的技术， 但在临床试验中我们看到慢性疼痛病人减少了百分之44到64。
This is not "The Matrix."	这不是骇客任务。
You take control.	只有你自己可以握有控制权。
I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.	我已经看过我的大脑内部，很快的你也可以。
When you do, what do you want to control?	当你可以控制你的脑部，你想要控制什么呢？
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.	您将能够全方位了解自己人格组成的各方面及自己的经验。
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.	有一些区块我们还在努力研究，今天我没有时间去深入论述。

The one I liked the best is, someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab, synthesize some fake Ellen DNA, and plant it at a crime scene.	我最喜欢的一个是 有人下载了我们基因序列，回到实验室 合成一个假Ellen的DNA 然后放在一个犯罪现场里
But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk.	但像DIY生物学一样，我相信它正面的结果 以及为带来研究的益处 还是超过了风险
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"	也许你会自问 在生物实验室我都能做些什么？
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well, what would anyone do with a personal computer?"	不久前类似的问题也有过 人们用电脑都能做些什么？

The thing is, there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else.	问题关键是，在这样的实验室里 有些东西是你在别处找不到的 有些东西是你在别处找不到的
There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.	黑客空间有好的一面，就是 你可以开展项目 而无须向任何人解释它会带来丰厚的利润 无须向任何人解释它会拯救人类，甚至它能够行得通
It just has to follow safety guidelines.	只要遵循安全规定
Why not personal biotech?	所以为什么不能让个人生物科技也如此呢？

Thank you.	谢谢！
I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.	我来给大家展示 认识我们看不到的东西是件多么有趣的事情。
You're about to experience a new, available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives.	你们马上要体验到一种全新的，已经可用的， 令人激动的科技如何能让我们的生活 保持干爽。
What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material.	我这边有一块儿煤渣砖。 我们在它的半面喷上了纳米技术涂层。 这种涂层几乎可以在任何材料上使用。
It's called Ultra-Ever Dry, and when you apply it to any material, it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.	它叫做极度干燥。 当你把它用在任何材料上时， 它会变成一层超疏水保护层。
So this is a cinder block, uncoated, and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.	看煤渣砖这边没有涂保护层的地方， 大家可以看到水渗进去了。
Not anymore.	没有渗进去。
Porous, nonporous.	渗水，不渗水
So what's superhydrophobic?	那么什么是超疏水？
Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface.	它是用来测量 一个表面上的水滴的。
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is, and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.	水滴越圆，越疏水。 如果水滴非常圆的话，就叫超疏水了。
A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees.	刚上过蜡的汽车，水分子与平面的接触角弧度 突降到大概90度。
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.	一扇挡风玻璃涂层大概是110度。
But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees, and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.	但是你看这边是160到175度之间 所有超过150度的都叫做超疏水。
So as part of the demonstration, what I have is a pair of gloves, and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating, and let's see if you can tell which one, and I'll give you a hint.	接下来的一个演示 我有一双手套 其中一只涂了 纳米科技涂层 看看大家能不能看出是哪一只 我来给你们一个提示。
Did you guess the one that was dry?	大家猜的是干的那只吗？
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience, what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits.	当我们有了纳米科技和纳米科学， 我们现在就可以 了解原子和分子，让它们 造福人类。
And we're talking really small here.	我们在说非常小的东西
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers, and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and to put some scale to that, if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick, and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them, you'd be the width of a human hair.	我们用纳米单位来衡量纳米技术， 一纳米是十亿分之一米， 换句话说， 如果你有一个一纳米厚的纳米粒子， 把5万个这样的纳米粒子一个一个按顺序排起来， 它们的粗细就相当于一根头发。
So very small, but very useful.	所以，非常微小，但是却十分有用。
And it's not just water that this works with.	而且它不仅对水有作用
It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete, water-based paint, mud, and also some refined oils as well.	对很多水性材料也有作用，比如混凝土， 水彩画， 水泥， 和成品油。
You can see the difference.	大家看到差别了吧
Moving onto the next demonstration, we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it, we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating, and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle, and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would, except when it hits the coating, it stops, and I can't even coax it to leave.	来看下一个演示 我们这边有一片玻璃 我们用纳米技术把玻璃的边框封起来 然后我们把绿色的水倒到中间 大家会发现，水在玻璃上四散开来， 很正常的现象， 但是水在碰到疏水层的时候停下了， 我甚至都不能把水推到外面去。
It's that afraid of the water.	看它是多么怕水！
So what's going on here? What's happening?	那么究竟怎么回事？
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.	其实，这个涂层的表面 覆盖着纳米粒子 让这个表面变得非常粗糙不平。
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.	你可能以为它会很光滑，其实不是。
And it has billions of interstitial spaces, and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air.	而且它有几十亿的空隙 这些空隙和纳米粒子一起 吸附空气分子 让表面覆盖上空气。
It's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.	这就形成了一层空气保护伞。 当水，水泥，混凝土 撞到这层空气时，它们就不会附着了。
So if I put this inside this water here, you can see a silver reflective coating around it, and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle, and it's dry.	如果我把这个桨放在水里， 大家会看到它上面的银色反光涂层 这层银色的反光涂层 就是防止水 弄湿桨的空气层。看，还是干的！
So what are the applications?	那么到底有什么用呢？
I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.	大部分人现在估计已经在绞尽脑汁了。
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says, "Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."	每个看到这个兴奋的人都会说， 哦，我可以用它来做这，做那。
The applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti-wetting.	最基本的应用 就是防水。
We've certainly seen that today.	我们今天已经看到了。
It could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.	它也可以用来防滑。 因为没有水，就没有冰。
It could be anti-corrosion.	它也可以用来防腐蚀。
No water, no corrosion.	没有水，就没有腐蚀。
It could be anti-bacterial.	也可以用来抗菌。
Without water, the bacteria won't survive.	没有水，细菌就不会存活。
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.	而且也可以用于任何需要保持自我清洁的东西。
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work.	让我们来想象一下像这样的东西 会如何帮助改变大家自己的工作。
And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration, but before I do that, I would like to say thank you, and think small.	接下来是今天最后一个演示 但是首先非常感谢大家， 请着眼小处！
It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.	结果会出来的，等一下，等一下，
You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED?	主持人：大家没听说我们正换TED的设计呢吧？
[Two minutes later...] He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.	［两分钟后...］ 他在掌握药物研究方面经历了各种困难
It's happening!	结果出来了！
I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality.	今日我想要稍微谈论 那些预知的非理性
And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital.	我对非理性的行为态度产生兴趣 从很多年以前开始，在一个医院里
I was burned very badly.	当时我严重烧伤
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital, you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.	如果你在医院里待了很长时间 你将会看见许多不同类型的荒谬
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.	在医院的烧烫伤部门让我最难以接受的荒谬 发生在护士为我拆除绷带的时候
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point, and you must have wondered what's the right approach.	每个人应该都有使用创可贴的经验 你也应该想过怎样撕掉才是最好的
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time, but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach?	你是瞬间撕开 － 时间短但很痛 还是慢慢地把它撕掉 虽然时间长，但感觉不这么痛 哪一种才是比较好的方式？
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip, and they would grab hold and they would rip.	当时在我部门的护士认为一次快速的撕开才是正确的 她们紧抓，然后撕开 然后再紧抓，再撕开
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.	当时我身体有百分之七十的烧伤，整个过程要一个小时
And as you can imagine, I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.	你可以想象 我非常痛恨撕开绷带 极端痛苦的那刻
And I would try to reason with them and say, "Why don't we try something else?	我努力地想和她们讲理 我们不能试试其他方法吗？
Why don't we take it a little longer -- maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity?"	我们不能花长一点的时间 或许两个小时 － 让痛苦不要这么强烈？
And the nurses told me two things.	护士告诉我两件事
They told me that they had the right model of the patient -- that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain -- and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...	她们告诉我她们知道什么对患者是最好的 她们知道如何减低我的痛苦 并且患者这个词的意思 不包括提出建议或尝试干涉
This is not just in Hebrew, by the way.	不只在希伯来文是如此
It's in every language I've had experience with so far.	几乎我目前遇见的所有语言都是如此
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do, and they kept on doing what they were doing.	于是我无能为力 她们继续她们的方法
And about three years later, when I left the hospital, I started studying at the university.	三年后，当我离开医院时 我开始在大学做研究
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question, maybe learn something about the world.	我在学校里学的最有趣的事情是 实验法的存在 你可以靠复制经验 来尝试找出解答 抽象地说，你可以试着检验你的问题 以尝试了解这个世界上的事情
So that's what I did.	于是我就这么做了
I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.	我仍然对 如何撕开患者身上的绷带这个问题很有兴趣
So originally I didn't have much money, so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.	刚开始我没有什么资金 我去五金行买了一个木匠用的老虎钳
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it, and I would crunch it a little bit.	我把那些来到实验室的人的手指放到里面 然后嘎吱一下
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods, and pain that went up and pain that went down, and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain.	我会用较长的时间或较短的时间挤压 那些较为严重的痛 和较轻微的痛 有休息的 和没有休息的 － 许多不同种类的痛
And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them, so, how painful was this?	当我结束伤害他们的时候，我会问 这样有多痛？
Or, how painful was this?	那样又有多痛？
Or, if you had to choose between the last two, which one would you choose?	如果你可以从中选择一种的话 你会选择哪一种？
I kept on doing this for a while.	我这么做了一阵子
And then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.	就像所有优秀的学术研究一样，我有更多资金
I moved to sounds, electrical shocks -- I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.	我开始加入声波，电击 我甚至制作了一件疼痛服让人们能感受到更多痛楚
But at the end of this process, what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.	但在研究结束后 我发觉护士们是错的
Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience, and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.	虽然她们都是善良的人 经验丰富，但就算如此 她们的观念仍然是错误的
It turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity, I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower.	因为在我们测量痛楚时 我们并没有考虑到延续性 如果把时间拉长 我的痛楚就会减低
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face, which was much more painful, and move toward my legs, giving me a trend of improvement over time -- that would have been also less painful.	最好的方法是从最痛的脸部开始 再逐渐地往腿部下移 让我有一种逐渐减缓的感觉 这样也能减低我的痛苦
And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.	如果我可以在过程中稍作休息 让我有一些时间从痛楚中恢复
All of these would have been great things to do, and my nurses had no idea.	这所有的方法都能改善我当时的情况 但这些护士却毫无所悉
And from that point on I started thinking, are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?	从那时我开始想 这些护士是全世界唯一有这种错误认知的人 在这件特别的事情上，还是这其实是一种普遍现象？
And it turns out it's a more general case -- there's a lot of mistakes we do.	于是我发现 其实这是一个普遍现象 我们时常犯下这样的错误
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities, and I want to talk to you about cheating.	在这里我想以作弊作为例子 来讨论这些非理性
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting, but also it tells us something, I think, about the stock market situation we're in.	我选择作弊的原因是因为它很有趣 也因为它也为我们现在股市的现状 提供了一些线索
So, my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden, and I started thinking about what is happening here.	我对作弊的兴趣从 美国安然公司突然爆发丑闻开始 我开始思考究竟发生了什么事情
Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things, or are we talking a more endemic situation, that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?	难道这是来自一些 害群之马才能犯下的例子 还是一种地方性的现象 许多人都抱持着这样的态度？
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.	于是，我们决定故技重施，进行一些简单的试验
And here's how it went.	我们是这样做的
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve, but I wouldn't give you enough time.	如果你参加了这个实验，我会给你一张纸 上面有二十个人人能解决的简单数学问题 但我不会给你足够的时间
When the five minutes were over, I would say, "Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."	当五分钟到了以后，我会说 把纸交给我，答对一题我就给你一块钱。
People did this.	人们这么做了。
I would pay people four dollars for their task -- on average people would solve four problems.	我付他们四块 平均来说，人可以解决四个问题
Other people I would tempt to cheat.	我尝试引诱其中一些人作弊
I would pass their sheet of paper.	我会给他们一张纸
When the five minutes were over, I would say, "Please shred the piece of paper.	五分钟到了以后，我会说 请将那张纸撕碎
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack, and tell me how many questions you got correctly."	把碎片放在口袋或是背包里， 然后告诉我你答对了几题。
People now solved seven questions on average.	平均突然从四题变成了七题
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples -- a few people cheated a lot.	不是有几个害群之马 -- 换句话说，一小群人作很大的弊
Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.	而是一大群人作一些小弊
Now, in economic theory, cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.	在经济学理论上 作弊是一种非常简单的成本效益分析
You say, what's the probability of being caught?	被抓到的可能性有多高？
How much do I stand to gain from cheating?	我作弊的好处有多少？
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?	被抓到会有怎样的惩罚？
And you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis, and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.	你衡量这些选项 一个简单的成本效益分析 然后决定是否值得犯下罪行
So, we try to test this.	我们对此进行一些测验
For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with -- how much money they could steal.	我们开始给他们不同数目的金钱 他们所能偷窃的数目
We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents, a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.	我们给他们十分钱，五十分 一块钱，五块钱，到十块钱一个问题
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases, people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.	你预估当桌上的钱增多时 人们也更愿意作弊。但事实上却不是
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.	仍有许多人为了很少的金钱作弊
What about the probability of being caught?	那难道是被抓到的可能性吗？
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper, so there was some evidence left.	有些人只撕了半张纸 还有些证据留下
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.	有些人撕碎了整张纸
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room, and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.	有些人彻底撕碎了全部，走出房间 然后从放有超过百元美金的碗里拿走钱
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down, people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.	你会预估当被抓的可能性降低 人们作弊的几率便会提升，但却不是如此
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit, and they were insensitive to these economic incentives.	又一次地，许多人作了一些小弊 人们并没被这些经济学所说的诱因影响
So we said, "If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces, what could be going on?"	我们想如果这些符合经济学逻辑的解答 这些原因，对人们不造成影响 那么究竟发生了什么事？
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.	于是我们想，或许有两种力量
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.	一方面，我们都有自省的能力 都希望对自己感觉良好，所以我们不想作弊
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit, and still feel good about ourselves.	另一方面，我们作一点小弊 在还能对自己感觉良好的范围里
So, maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over, but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree, as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.	所以或许 我们心中有一种不能跨越的尺度 但我们仍然能从一些小奸小恶中获利 只要不要让我们自己感到不齿
We call this like a personal fudge factor.	我们说这叫自我蒙混因素
Now, how would you test a personal fudge factor?	但我们该如何测试自我蒙混因素呢？
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?	刚开始我们说，我们该怎么做来降低蒙混因素呢？
So, we got people to the lab, and we said, "We have two tasks for you today."	当人们进入实验室时，我们说 今日我们要给你两个任务。
First, we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school, or to recall The Ten Commandments, and then we tempted them with cheating.	第一，我们问其中一半的人 回想十本他们在高中所看过的书 或是回忆圣经中的十诫 然后我们尝试让他们作弊。
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments -- but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments, given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.	我们发觉那些尝试回想十诫的人 虽然在我们的标本中没有任何人能完整背诵出十诫 但那些尝试回想圣经十诫的人 面对作弊的可能性，却没有作弊
It wasn't that the more religious people -- the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less, and the less religious people -- the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments -- cheated more.	那并不代表对宗教信仰比较虔诚的人 那些能背诵出较多十诫的人，比较少作弊 或那些对宗教信仰比较不虔诚的人 那些无法回忆出任何一诫的人 比较会作弊
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments, they stopped cheating.	在人们尝试回想十诫的那一刻 他们便不作弊了
In fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat, they don't cheat at all.	事实上，就算我们让那些自称是无神论的人 把手放在圣经上发誓，然后再给他们作弊的机会 他们也仍然没有作弊
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system, so we said, "Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"	要把圣经十诫带进教育系统里 是一件困难的事，所以我们说 不然我们让人们在荣誉行为准则上签名吧？
So, we got people to sign, "I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."	于是，我们让他们签名， 我认知这份简短调查遵行麻省理工学院的荣誉准则
Then they shredded it.	然后把它撕碎。
No cheating whatsoever.	没有任何人作弊
And this is particularly interesting, because MIT doesn't have an honor code.	这真是非常有趣 因为麻省理工学院根本没有任何荣誉准则
So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.	这是有关降低蒙混因素的
What about increasing the fudge factor?	又如何提高蒙混因素呢？
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators -- these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.	第一个实验中 我在麻省理工学院游走 我把半打可乐放进不同的冰箱中 都是些给大学生的普通冰箱
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?	然后再回去测量我们所说的 可乐的人生周期 - 它们能在冰箱里留多久？
As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.	你可以想象那并没有多久。人们拿走它们。
In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills, and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.	相对的，我把一个装着六章一块钱美金钞票的盘子 放进那些同样的冰箱
No bill ever disappeared.	没有任何一张美金被拿走
Now, this is not a good social science experiment, so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before.	这大概不是一个好的社会科学实验 为了改善我再做了一次一样的实验 就像我和诸位形容的一样
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.	三分之一的人把试验纸交会给我们
A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it, they came to us and said, "Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems.	三分之一的人把纸撕碎 他们跟我们说 先生，我解决了几个问题，给我几块钱。
Give me X dollars."	
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper, they came to us and said, "Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems.	三分之一的人，在他们把纸撕碎以后 他们跟我们说 先生，我解决了几个问题，给我几个代币。
Give me X tokens."	
We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.	我们没有付他们现金，而是一些其他的代替品
And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side, and exchanged it for dollars.	他们拿着这些代替品，走到十二英尺远的旁边 再把代替品换成现金
Think about the following intuition.	试着想想以下的假设状况
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home, compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?	从公司拿一支铅笔 或是从公司钱柜里拿走十分钱 哪一种感觉比较差？
These things feel very differently.	这些事给人的感觉差异很大
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference?	把现金移动到稍为远一点的地方，改拿代币 能不能造成什么差异？
Our subjects doubled their cheating.	我们实验对象的作弊情况提高了两倍
I'll tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute.	稍后我会告诉你 这些例子和股市有什么关联
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet, because in Enron, there's also a social element.	但这仍然无法解决我对安然公司的疑问 因为在安然，还有一个社会性的元素
People see each other behaving.	人们眼见其他人的作为
In fact, every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating.	事实上，每天我们看新闻 都能看到人们作弊欺骗的例子
What does this cause us?	这怎么影响我们？
So, we did another experiment.	所以，我们又做了另一个实验
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment, and we prepaid them.	我们召来一大群学生来参加实验 我们先付他们钱
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment, and we told them that at the end, we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?	所以每个人都先拿到装着实验回馈的信封 在结束时，我们请他们 把没有赚到的钱还给我们
The same thing happens.	同样的事情发生了
When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.	当我们给人们作弊的机会，他们作弊了
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.	他们只作了一点小弊，但都一样
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.	但这次我们请来一位学生演员
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said, "I solved everything.	这个学生演员在三十秒后站起来，说 我解开所有题目了，现在呢？
What do I do now?"	
And the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.	实验者则回答如果你做完所有题目了，就回去吧。
That's it.	就这样。
The task is finished."	任务结束了。
So, now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group.	所以现在我们有了一个学生 - 一个演员 在这组人中
Nobody knew it was an actor.	没有人知道他是个演员
And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.	只知道他明目张胆的作弊
What would happen to the other people in the group?	这会对在场的其他人有什么影响？
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less?	他们会作更多的弊，或是相反？
Here is what happens.	事情是这样发生的。
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.	结果是，那取决于他们身上穿的衣服
Here is the thing.	因为
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.	我们在卡内基梅隆和匹兹堡大学进行这次实验
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities, Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.	在匹兹堡有两家主要的大学 卡内基梅隆和匹兹堡大学
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students.	而我们的实验对象 都是卡内基梅隆大学的学生
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student -- he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student -- but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.	当站起来的演员穿着卡内基梅隆的衣服 他其实也是个卡内基梅隆的学生 也就是说他是团队中的一员，作弊的情况增加了
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt, cheating went down.	但当他穿着一件匹兹堡大学的外衣时 作弊的情况便减少了
Now, this is important, because remember, when the moment the student stood up, it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating, because the experimenter said, "You've finished everything.	这是很重要的一点，因为记住 在这个学生站起来的那一刻 他对在场所有人证明作弊是可行的 因为实验者说 你做完所有题目了，回去吧。
Go home," and they went with the money.	他们就带着钱回去了
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.	所以这和被抓到的几率无关
It was about the norms for cheating.	而是一种作弊的典范
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating, we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.	如果在我们的团队中有人作弊，我们也看到他们作弊 我们便觉得那是适当的，身为一个团队，有这一样的态度
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people -- I mean, not terrible in this -- but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with, from another university, another group, all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up -- a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment -- and people cheat even less.	但如果是个外人，那些糟糕的人 不是说他们做题做的不好 而是那些我们不想被当成一丘之貉的人 那些其他学校的，其他团体的 突然人们的诚实和警觉性都提高了 有点类似之前的圣经十诫实验 作弊的情况更加降低了。
So, what have we learned from this about cheating?	所以，我们究竟从这些实验中学到了什么？
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.	我们知道许多人都会作弊
They cheat just by a little bit.	他们作一点点小弊
When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.	当我们唤起人们的道德感，作弊的情况减少
When we get bigger distance from cheating, from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.	当我们提高和作弊之中的距离 像是现金，作弊的情况便提高
And when we see cheating around us, particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.	当我们看到身边的人作弊 尤其是我们的同侪，作弊的情况便提高
Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market, think about what happens.	当我们想到股市的时候 想到现在发生的事情
What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way?	当你创造了这个环境 你付他们很多的钱 扭曲了他们对现实的看法？
Would they not be able to see it this way?	他们能不这么看吗？
Of course they would.	当然他们会这样做。
What happens when you do other things, like you remove things from money?	当你又做了一些其他的事情 像是用一些东西代替现金？
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives, mortgage-backed securities.	你叫他们股票，或是选择权，衍生商品 按揭证券
Could it be that with those more distant things, it's not a token for one second, it's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more?	有没有可能因为这些东西听来遥远 它不只是一个几秒外的代币 而是离现金有一段距离的象征物 冠以更长的时间 - 人们是否会更容易作弊？
And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them?	在今日的社会环境中，人们看到他人的行为时 又会有什么影响和反应？
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market.	这全都是一些很不好的因素和影响 在今日的股市中
More generally, I want to tell you something about behavioral economics.	我想泛泛地谈一些 有关行为经济学的事
We have many intuitions in our life, and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.	在人生中我们有许多直觉 却有许多是错误的
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?	问题是，我们该去检视这些直觉吗？
We can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life, in our business life, and most particularly when it goes to policy, when we think about things like No Child Left Behind, when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies -- taxation, health care and so on.	我们可以思考我们该如何去检视这些直觉 从我们的私生活，我们的公事 特别是制定政策的时候 当我们想到一些像一个都不能少这种教育政策 当你开发一些新的股票市场，当你制定一些新的政策 税法，健康保险等
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.	检测直觉是非常困难的 这是在我回去和这些护士谈话时 学到的一个教训。
So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.	我回到当初的医院 告诉他们对于撕开绷带方法的新发现
And I learned two interesting things.	我学到两件有趣的事
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie, told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.	一是我最喜欢的护士，Ettie 告诉我我并没有考虑到她的痛苦
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.	她说当然，那对你来说很痛苦
But think about me as a nurse, taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked, and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.	但想想身为护士的我 要从一个我喜欢的人身上撕开这些绷带 并且要长期不断地重复这个动作
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."	我也不想为自己带来这么大的折磨，那也并不好受。
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.	她说，或许对她来说如此困难是因为
But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said, "I did not think that your intuition was right.	这实在非常有趣，因为她说 我不觉得你的直觉是对的
I felt my intuition was correct."	我觉得我的直觉才是对的。
So, if you think about all of your intuitions, it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.	所以，当想到我们的那些直觉时 要相信自己的直觉是错误的是非常困难的。
And she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." -- she thought her intuition was right -- it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong.	她说，正因为我认为我的直觉是对的 她也认为她的直觉是正确的 她很难接受这样去做一个艰难的实验 来证明她是对或错。
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.	但事实上，这正是我们每日面对的状况
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things -- our own ability, how the economy works, how we should pay school teachers.	对许多事我们都有很强的直觉 我们自己的能力，经济运作的方式 我们应该付给学校老师多少薪水
But unless we start testing those intuitions, we're not going to do better.	但在我们真正开始去检测这些直觉前 我们都不会有什么进步
And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition, and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.	只要想想如果那些护士能检测自己的直觉 我的人生会有多大的改善 每件事又会有多大的改善 如果我们能开始有系统性地测验我们的直觉
Thank you very much.	非常谢谢各位。
In this talk today, I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment.	在今天的演讲里，我想陈述一个不同的观点 关于为什么投资儿童的学龄前教育 可以被看做为一种公共投资。
It's a different idea, because usually, when people talk about early childhood programs, they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants, in preschool, they have better K-12 test scores, better adult earnings.	这是一个不同的观点，因为经常 人们谈论儿童学龄前教育方案时 他们探讨的是接受了学前教育的孩子是否 比没有接受学前教育的孩子做得更好 他们从小学到高中有更好的成绩 成年之后有更高的收入。
Now that's all very important, but what I want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development.	的确这些都很重要 但我想讨论的是学前教育如何影响 各州的经济 并且促进各州的经济发展。
And that's actually crucial because if we're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs, we need to interest state governments in this.	这其实是很关键的 因为如果我们想要提高对 儿童学龄前教育计划的投资 我们就需要各州政府对它感兴趣。
The federal government has a lot on its plate, and state governments are going to have to step up.	联邦政府有很多问题需要解决 所以各州政府需要向前迈一步。
So we have to appeal to them, the legislators in the state government, and turn to something they understand, that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy.	于是我们需要呼吁他们 各州的立法者们 并且转换成他们理解的东西 他们需要促进他们州的 经济发展。
Now, by promoting economic development, I don't mean anything magical.	我所说的促进经济发展 并不是什么神奇的东西。
All I mean is, is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents.	我只是想说明，儿童学龄前教育 可以为各州带来更多与更好的工作 也因此能够提高各州居民的 人均收入。
Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development, they don't generally think first about what they're doing about childcare and early childhood programs.	现在，我认为一般人在谈及 各个州和地方经济发展时 他们大多不会想到这会跟当地的 儿童看护和早教计划有什么关系。
I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.	而我了解，我的整个职业生涯都在研究这些计划
I've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues, a lot of legislators about these issues.	我与很多州际经济发展机构负责人 讨论过这些问题 也与许多立法者讨论过。
When legislators and others think about economic development, what they first of all think about are business tax incentives, property tax abatements, job creation tax credits, you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.	当立法者和其他人思考关于经济发展时 他们首先想到营业税优惠政策 减免财产税， 创造就业机会税收抵免 正如你所知，这类计划多到数不清
So for example, states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.	例如，各州对在吸引新建汽车厂 或扩展汽车厂项目上竞争非常激烈。
They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.	他们给予各种各样的营业税减免政策。
Now, those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions, and the way they can make sense is, by creating more and better jobs, they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.	这些计划能够达到预期效果 取决于他们是否吸引了新的制造厂来到本地 而吸引投资和制造业的目的 就是创造更多与更好的工作， 提高就业率，提高居民人均收入。
So there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they're paying by paying for these business tax breaks.	这对于当地的居民是有好处的 虽然他们也需要付出一些代价 他们需要承担那些减免的营业税
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing, create more and better jobs, but in a different way.	我的观点是儿童学龄前教育在本质上 可以达到一样的效果 创造更多更好的工作，但用另外一种方法
It's a somewhat more indirect way.	这是一个间接的方法
These programs can promote more and better jobs by, you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool, it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around, and, in turn, that higher-quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community.	这些计划可以带来更多更好的工作 如果我们投资建立高质量的学前教育 它会提高当地劳动力的技能 如果这些孩子们有足够的人留在当地 那么这些更高质量的劳动人口 将会成为当地创造新的工作机会的主力 并成为提高当地社区人均收入水平的中坚力量。
Now, let me turn to some numbers on this.	接下来让我给你们展示一些具体的数据。
Okay. If you look at the research evidence -- that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment, wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults, you take those known effects, you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out, and you take research on how much skills drive job creation, you will conclude, from these three separate lines of research, that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs, the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and 78 cents, so that's a three-to-one return.	如果你翻阅研究资料—— 这方面的研究已经很多——关于学龄前教育计划 如何对参加过学龄前教育的人的 教育程度，薪水和技能的影响， 我们把这些影响综合起来， 估算一下接受学前教育的人有多少大的比例 会留在当地的经济圈中，没有搬走 再考虑到通过学龄前教育提高的劳动技能 促进创造了多少就业机会，你就会得出结论， 这三个不同方向的研究结果表明 在儿童早教计划中每投入一美元 会对各州居民的人均收入 增加2美金78美分 所以这是三比一的回报率
Now you can get much higher returns, of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits, if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state, but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers, and it's the states that are going to have to act.	你可以得到更高的回报率 高达十六比一，如果你把社会治安的改进也考虑进来， 并且把接受过学龄前教育，但是后来 搬出去的人的收益也算在内的话。 但是现在我们把注意力放在这三美元上 因为这三个方面对于州立法者 和州政策制定者而言是最重要的 而这也是让州政府行动起来的理由。
So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development.	所以对于各州的政策制定者而言 这将是一项对本州经济意义重大的举措。
Now, one objection you often hear, or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is, why should I pay more taxes to invest in other people's children?	你可能听说过一些反对意见 或许你没有听说过因为人们不好意思说出来 就是为什么我需要付更多的税 去为别人孩子的教育投资
What's in it for me?	我得到了什么？
And the trouble with that objection, it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent.	这个异议的问题在于 它显示了人们的误解， 地方经济需要 每一个人的参与
Specifically, the interdependency here is, is that there are huge spillovers of skills -- that when other people's children get more skills, that actually increases the prosperity of everyone, including people whose skills don't change.	特别在这里他们是相互关联的 有大量的技术外溢效应 当其他人的孩子得到了更多的技术 实际上这样会让每个人更富有 包括了那些技术没有提高的人们
So for example, numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas, it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages; it's the skills of the area.	举个例子，众多的研究显示 如果你查看到底是什么驱动着 都市地区的增长率 并不是低税率，低成本，低工资 是这个地区的技术。
Particularly, the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.	特别是 当地高校毕业生的比例
So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically because they're low-cost.	所以当你看一些都市地区 比如波士顿，明尼阿波利斯 - 圣保罗 硅谷，这些地区经济发展良好 并不是因为它们成本很低
I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.	我不知道你有没有尝试过在硅谷买房子
It's not exactly a low-cost proposition.	并不是一个低成本的投资。
They are growing because they have high levels of skills.	它们在发展因为他们有高水准的技能
So when we invest in other people's children, and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth of a metro area.	所以当我们为别人的孩子投资 并且建立那些技能，我们提高了一个区域的 总体职业增长
As another example, if we look at what determines an individual's wages, and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages, we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part, on that individual's education, for example whether or not they have a college degree.	举另一个例子，如果我们看 是什么决定了一个人的工资 我们对此进行数据分析，是什么决定了工资 我们知道一个人的工资一部分取决于 这个人的教育 比如有没有接受过本科教育
One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition, we find that even once we hold constant, statistically, the effect of your own education, the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages.	另外一个非常有趣的事实是 我们发现就算我们在数据上 将你的教育程度对工资的影响保持不变 在都市区里其他人的教育 也会对你的工资产生影响
So specifically, if you hold constant your education, you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area, you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all.	具体一些，如果你将你的教育保持不变 把当地的本科生比例加进去 你会发现它对你的工资有明显的改善 而完全不需要改变你的受教育程度
In fact, this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree, the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects.	事实上，这个影响强烈到 当一个人获得了本科教育 它对于在大都市地区其他人 工资的溢出效应 实际大于直接影响
So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.	所以如果一个人获得了本科教育，他有生之年的收入 将会增加超过700,000美金
There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area, and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person, but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area, you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.	增加都市地区的高校毕业生比例 对当地的人们都会产生影响 并且如果你把他们加起来 - 这是对每个人的小影响 但是如果你把整个都市地区的人们加起来 实际上每个人得到了薪水的提升 在都市地区增加了近百万美金
That's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education.	这实际上是大于选择接受高等教育的人 所带来的直接效益
Now, what's going on here?	现在，这是怎么回事呢？
What can explain these huge spillover effects of education?	什么可以解释教育所带来的的巨大溢出效应？
Well, let's think about it this way.	那么，让我们这样想
I can be the most skilled person in the world, but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills, my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology, new production techniques.	我可以成为世界上技术能力最强的人 但是如果我的公司里的其他人缺乏技术 我的雇主会难以引进 新的技术，新的生产技术
So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.	因而导致我的雇主降低生产率
They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.	他将无法支付我良好的工资
Even if everyone at my firm has good skills, if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills, my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets.	就算在我公司里的每一个人有良好的技术 如果我的供应商的工人 没有良好的技术 在国内和国际市场竞争时 我的公司竞争力会降低
And again, the firm that's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages, and then, particularly in high-tech businesses, they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.	同样的，竞争力较弱的公司 将会没有能力支付更高的工资 并且，特别是在高技术公司中 他们会经常从别的公司窃取理念和工人
So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm, but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.	所以很明确硅谷的生产率 不仅与公司职员的技巧有所关联 更与当地其他公司的员工相关
So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high-quality, we not only help those children, we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth.	因此，如果我们可以为他人的孩子投资 通过高质量的学前教育和其他儿童早期教育计划 我们不仅可以帮助那些孩子 我们还会帮助都市地区的每一个人 提高总体的工资，并且能够促进都市地区的 就业增长。
Another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out.	另一个常见的反对意见 是担心早期儿童教育计划的投资 会随着人们搬走而打水漂。
So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in Columbus, Ohio, but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will, for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and become Wolverines.	因此，可能俄亥俄州打算为自己州的 哥伦布市的孩子们 投资学前教育计划， 但是他们担心这些小朋友们将来可能 因为一些奇怪的原因，决定搬去密歇根州的安阿伯市 并且变成密歇根人。
And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.	可能密歇根在想关于投资 密歇根州安阿伯市的幼儿教育，但他们也担心 这些密歇根人会最终搬到俄亥俄州然后变成俄州人
And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.	最终他们都因为担心人们搬走而减少学前教育投入
Well, the reality is, if you look at the data, Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.	事实上如果我们翻阅一下统计数据就会发现 美国没有人们想象的那么喜爱搬家
The data is that over 60 percent of Americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in, over 60 percent.	数据显示百分之六十以上的美国人 大部分的职业生涯花在 他们出生的州，多余百分之六十
That percentage does not vary much from state to state.	这个比例在各州之间变化不大
It doesn't vary much with the state's economy, whether it's depressed or booming, it doesn't vary much over time.	这并不会受到各州经济形势的影响。 无论是萧条或是发展 随着时间的推移它并不会有很大的改变
So the reality is, if you invest in kids, they will stay.	所以现实是，如果你为孩子投资 他们会留下来
Or at least, enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy.	至少会有足够多的人留下来 为当地的经济发展做出贡献。
Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way, pay off in higher adult skills.	好的，总结一下，有很多的研究证据表明 为高质量的学龄前教育投入，能够通过 提高成年劳动技能的方式得到补偿。
There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy, and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy, and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar, we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy.	有很多的研究结果表明 这些人会留在州经济圈中 并且有很多证据表明在地区经济中 高技能劳动者数量的增加 能够提高平均工资，促进就业增长 并且我们计算得到每多投入一美元 就能够为当地经济 多贡献三美元的收益。
So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling.	所以在我看来，这些研究成果是令人信服的 并且这个逻辑是有说服力的
So what are the barriers to getting it done?	那么有哪些障碍阻止我们去做这些事情？
Well, one obvious barrier is cost.	嗯，一个明显的障碍就是费用
Okay?	清楚了么？
A hundred dollars per capita, per person, is something that any state government can afford to do.	每人一百美金， 每一个州政府都有能力做到
It's just a simple matter of political will to do it.	这只是政府会不会去做的问题
And, of course, as I mentioned, this cost has corresponding benefits.	当然，就如同我所说过的 这个支出有相对应的收益
I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three, 2.78, for the state economy, in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.	我提过这有一个大约1比3的回报率 2.78，对于州政府来说 代表着800亿美金的额外收入
And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something, what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid, that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career, just doing the preschool, not improving K-12 or anything else after that, not doing anything with college tuition or access, just directly improving preschool, and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle-class kids.	如果我们想把上百亿的美金转化成 一些有意义的事情 那么我可以告诉你，仅仅通过提高学龄前教育的质量， 不需要对K-12（大学前教育）作任何的改动 不需要对大学做任何的改造 就能够使低收入家庭背景的孩子 在成年后的总收入提高10% 并能够为来自中等收入家庭的孩子 将他们的平均薪水 提高5%。
So this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state's population and produces large and tangible benefits.	所以这是一个投资 有非常实际的回报 能够为各州不同收入层次的人群 产生实实在在的利益
Now, that's one barrier.	现在，这里有一个障碍
I actually think the more profound barrier is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.	我觉得更严重的障碍 是学龄前教育计划回报的长期性特点
So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing the quality of our local workforce, and thereby increasing economic development.	所以，我的论点是我们提高 当地劳动力的水平 将会提高地方经济
Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds, we're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops, right?	显然如果我们把4岁的孩子送到幼儿园 我们不会让这些孩子在5岁时 送去糖果店工作，对吧？
At least I hope not.	至少我希望如此
So we're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years, and of course America is notorious for being a short term-oriented society.	所以我们在谈论一个投资 对各州经济的影响 在15到20年以内是不会体现出来的 并且美国是众所周知的 短期性社会
Now one response you can make to this, and I sometimes have done this in talks, is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs, there are benefits, parents care about preschool, maybe we'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool, and I think those are true, but in some sense they're missing the point.	现在你可以对此作出的一个回应 并且我有时会在谈论时这么做 人们可以讨论关于这些计划所带来的好处 在减低特殊教育和补习教育成本 家长们关心学龄前教育 也许我们会得到一些迁移效果 让家长们寻找好的幼儿园 我觉得这是正确的 但是在某种意义上他们忽略了重点
Ultimately, this is something we're investing in now for the future.	归根结底，这是我想说的 我们为未来而投资
And so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question.	所以我将留给大家 这个我认为的根本问题
I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately not an economic question, it's a moral question: Are we willing, as Americans, are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long-term future of not only our kids, but our community?	我想说，我是一个经济学家，但这在根本上 不是一个经济学问题，这是一个道德问题： 我们是否愿意，作为美国人 我们作为一个社会是否仍然能够 做出政治上的选择去牺牲现在 以付出更多的税作为代价 以改善长远的未来 不仅为了我们的孩子，也是为了我们的社会
Are we still capable of that as a country?	作为一个国家我们是否还能够做到这一点？
And that's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves.	这是每一个公民 每一个选民需要问他们自己的问题
Is that something that you are still invested in, that you still believe in the notion of investment?	这是否是你仍然在坚持投资的， 那个你始终相信的投资理念
That is the notion of investment.	这就是投资的理念
You sacrifice now for a return later.	为未来牺牲现在
So I think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong.	所以我认为这些 对于儿童学龄前教育计划好处 的研究证据是极强的
However, the moral and political choice is still up to us, as citizens and as voters.	但是，道德和政治上的选择 还是取决于我们，作为公民和投票者
Thank you very much.	谢谢（鼓掌）
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.	音乐，大家都非常热爱它， 因为它对于我们很重要。
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.	假如你不只是作为一名听众，而且还能亲自参与创作，那么音乐会对你更具影响力。
So, that's my first idea.	这是我要讲的第一点。
And we all know about the Mozart effect -- the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero], that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.	在最近5-10年里， 有个著名的莫扎特效应， 讲的就是单靠听音乐，或者是给胎儿播放音乐， 就可以使我们的智商提高10%到30%。
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.	这真是个好主意，但是根本行不通。
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.	光听是不够的，你还必须设法创作音乐。
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work.	我还要说，不单如此， 我们每一个人、世界上的所有的人， 都应该能够进行创作，并以动态的方式让自己和音乐融为一体。 这正是我从事的工作中非常重要的一部分。
What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience, not just listening, but making music?	 让大家不只是在聆听音乐，而且还能够创作音乐。
And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers -- we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince, orchestras, rock bands.	起初，我们为像马友友、Peter Gabriel、Prince这样的演奏大师， 以及管弦和摇滚乐队制作了超级乐器。
Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.	 这种乐器集成了多种传感器， 以感知我们是如何演奏乐曲的。
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling, I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra, or into something that nobody has ever heard before.	（有了它，）我只需稍稍改变演绎方式和感情， 就可以把大提琴演奏声变为和谐的人声、一个乐团的协奏， 甚至变成我们从未听过的天籁之音。
When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody, people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?	随即，我们开始思考， 为什么不能制作同样完美的乐器，使它成为平常人， 而不仅仅是马友友或Princes大师们所演奏呢？
So, we've made a whole series of instruments.	于是，我们制作了一组乐器，
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.	统称其为头脑歌剧。
It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments, all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.	这个管弦乐队大约有100件乐器， 都是按平常人的自然演奏方式所设计的。
So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music, use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound, touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.	这样，你可以打游戏，开过一段音乐， 使用肢体语言来控制大量的声音， 通过触摸特制的表面来产生美妙的乐音，还可以用自己的声音来营造某种氛围。
And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in, to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.	当这些乐器制作完成之后， 我们邀请公众前来体验，并和他们一起， 举办了多场演奏音乐会。
We toured that for a long time.	这些巡演持续了相当长的一段时间。
It is now permanently in Vienna, where we built a museum around it.	现在，在音乐之都维也纳， 我们还建造了一处永久性的博物馆。
Guitar Hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again.	 有一点，在我两个十几岁的女儿和实验室不少学生的身上， 都得到了验证。这就是，只要你提供合适的交互界面， 人们就会乐于融入音乐， 并对演奏乐此不疲。
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero.	这个模式可行，但是可做的远不止这些。 我的第二点观点就是， 仅用吉他英雄这类东西来做音乐还不够。
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.	音乐不仅非常有趣，而且还颇具影响力。
It's very, very important.	非常非常重要的一点是，
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.	音乐能够改变你的人生，为其他的方式所不及，
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind.	能够改变人与人之间的交流方式， 还能够改变你的身心。
So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.	于是，我们力求有所突破， 也就是想在吉他英雄这类事物的基础上做点什么。
We are very involved in education.	我们深入到教育界，开展了一个叫做玩具交响乐的长期项目。
We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive, but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music, want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works, how to make more, how to create.	 我们为小朋友制作了一系列特别好玩的乐器， 期望他们会喜欢上演奏， 并愿意在这方面投入时间，进而渴求学习乐理知识， 以及如何演奏、创作音乐。
So, we make squeezy instruments, like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers, Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm, and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends, who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing -- and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music.	我们制作了一种可以捏的乐器， 比如说这个可以测量手指间电流的音乐塑型机。 又如这个用于敲击节奏的 节拍虫子，你可以用它来收集节奏， 然后把这个信息像丢烫土豆似地传给你的朋友， 他们需要模仿你，或者对你的动作作出反应。
Extremely easy to use, but once you use it, you can go quite deep -- music in any style.	 它可以让大家用线条和色彩来绘制出复杂的音乐，（操作方法简便，）特别容易使用。
And then, by pressing a button, it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.	 一旦上了手，任何曲风的音乐，对你来说都是手到擒来。最后只要摁下按钮， 这个软件就能自动转换出乐谱，以便让音乐家来演奏你创作的乐章。
We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.	我们的这个软件，在世界各地的孩子和不同年龄段的人群身上， 都取得了良好的、非常显著的效果。
So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context, for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.	所以，我们乐于将此类创意运用到 更加广泛的人群中， 让那些没有机会进行音乐创作的人也能积极参与。
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.	其中，我们实验室正在拓展的一个领域叫作 音乐、心智和健康。
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called "Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore.	相信不少人都读过奥利佛•萨克斯的新书 《脑袋装了2000出歌剧的人》。
It's a great book.	这是一本正在热卖中的好书。
If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading.	如果你还没有看过，建议你读一读。
He's a pianist himself, and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.	 书的作者是一位钢琴家，他在书中详细地记录了自己职业生涯中所观察到的事实， 那就是音乐在非常状态下的人身上（残疾／重症病人），所能发生的不可思议的效应。
So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.	正如大家所知道的那样， 音乐是老年痴呆症患者晚期能做出响应的最后一样事物。
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones, you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror, or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing.	也许不少人在挚爱亲朋身上观察到这样的现象： 他们无法识别镜子里的自己、无法认出家人， 但是你仍然能找到一段音乐， 让他们从病榻中惊醒，随声轻和。
And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.	 正是借助这样的方法，你可以唤回一些他们的记忆和自我意识。
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes, movement to people with Parkinson's disease.	对于治愈中风所导致的失语症，以及帕金森症所导致的运动失能， 音乐是最好的办法。
It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.	它对抑郁症、精神分裂症和许许多多其它病症都颇具疗效。
So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.	我们目前正在探寻这些现象背后的原理， 并开展一系列活动，用音乐来改善人类健康。
And we do this in many ways.	我们采取了很多方式，和各类医院有着合作。
It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.	许多年前， 我们在那里就开始将超级乐谱 介绍给生理和精神残疾病人。
This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital, so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.	这已成为图斯伯里医院核心治疗项目， 每个接受治疗的人都要求参与音乐活动。
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.	这一活动似乎大大加速了治疗的过程， 在某种程度上也把医院变成音乐社区。
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.	继续下一个话题之前，我想先给大家看些以上内容的相关短片。
They're manipulating each other's rhythms.	参与者在操控音乐节奏。
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.	通过亲身体验，孩子们不但学会了怎样演奏和听节奏， 而且锻炼了音乐记忆，练习了合奏。
To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it, to experiment with it, to make their own music.	他们拿着音乐，捏一捏， 改变和体验它，并创作自己的音乐。
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.	超级乐谱从涂涂画画开始，很便捷。
Everybody can experience music in a profound way, we just have to make different tools.	个人都可以深刻地体验音乐， 我们所必须做的就是创造各种各样的工具。
The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are.	第三点想法是：我觉得音乐，异乎寻常地， 是比语言更好的展示自我的方式。
I love giving talks, although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.	 我也喜欢做演讲， 但是奇怪的是，我在演讲时，比演奏音乐感觉要更局促些。
If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you, I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words, more personal things, perhaps deeper things.	当在演奏大提琴、控制电子音响合成器，或者和你们共同分享我的音乐时， 我就能展现无法用语言描述的一面， 更多的是个人的，也许更深层的东西。
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world.	对于我们中许多人来讲，我想的确是这样。我想举两个例子， 来说明音乐是我们与外界交流的 最有效的媒介之一。
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers.	首先是我们现在正在进行的一个非常疯狂的项目，名字叫作《死亡和鲍威尔一家》。
And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.	 它是一部大型歌剧， 是目前全球在运作中的大型歌剧项目之一。
And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.	它是关于一位富有、成功、有权势并期望永生的人的歌剧。
So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment, actually into a series of books.	他找到了把自己下载到他所建立的环境 —一系列的书籍—中去的办法。
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.	于是，他想长生不老，就把自己放进了系统中。
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.	主唱在歌剧开始后便消失了， 整个舞台变成了主角，变成了他的遗赠。
And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't.	这部歌剧讲的是，我们能和所爱的人分享些什么，向他们传承些什么， 又有什么是办不到的。
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument, like this chandelier.	歌剧中的所有道具都是活的、巨型的乐器。
It takes up the whole stage.	 譬如，占据舞台很大部份的一盏吊灯。
It looks like a chandelier, but it's actually a robotic music instrument.	它看上去像个吊灯， 但同时又是一件机器人乐器。
So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings, each string is controlled with a little robotic element -- either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings, acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.	正如你在这里的样机上所看到的，长长的钢琴弦， 每根都被小型机器人部件所控制。
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers, and his family.	 这里有小巧的琴弓来拨动，驱动器来撩拨， 声学信号来震动琴弦。
There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.	在舞台上，还会出现一大群机器人。
They observe the action.	这些机器人是主角西蒙•鲍威尔和家人之间交流的一种媒介。
We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots.	 他们为数众多，有如古希腊歌剧中的合唱团。
They follow the characters.	我们在实验室里设计和测试了这些立方形的 歌剧机器人。
They go off on their own.	它们很聪明， 我们也希望他们能互相规避。它们自主行动；
And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.	如果你打个指响，他们也会如你所愿，排成整齐的一行。
Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.	别看它们是一个个方盒子，却拥有许多人格化的内涵。
The largest set piece in the opera is called The System.	歌剧中最大的道具就是所谓系统。
It's a series of books.	它是一系列图书。
Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound, and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls, which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers.	每一部书都是一个机器人，都能运动，都能发声。 放在一起，它们构成了一道道投影墙， 展现出西蒙•鲍威尔的动作和性格。
So he's disappeared, but the whole physical environment becomes this person.	歌剧的主人公虽然消失在舞台上， 却存在于环境之中。
This is how he's chosen to represent himself.	这是他选择的，代表自己的办法。
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.	这些书的书脊上集成了LED光源，作为显示平面。
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.	这位是男中音詹姆士•抹大拉，他正在进入系统。
This is a sneak preview.	这是预告片。
This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009.	首映将于2009年10月在摩洛哥举行。
If by any chance you can't make it, another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.	 西蒙用一种非同寻常的方法，即通过音乐和环境，来建立他的遗赠。
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces, as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.	我们将把系统放在网络和公共场所， 以便人人都能用音乐和生活中的影像 来制作我们或者我们挚爱的人的遗赠。
So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera.	这不再是一部单纯的大歌剧，它将把我们现在所想的， 变成一部个性化歌剧。
And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?	要做个性化歌剧，怎么能没有个性化的乐器呢？
Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.	我到目前为止所展示的这些，比如给马友友的超级大提琴， 又如给孩子们捏音乐的玩具，这些乐器都是一成不变的， 或为艺术家，或为小朋友，它仅仅针对某一类人有着实用价值。
But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work, to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?	试想一下，如果我再制作一种乐器，能够适应我的个人行为， 按照手指弹奏方式，根据我熟悉的，甚至不熟悉的技法 来自我调整，情况又会如何呢？
I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.	我以为这就是交互界面、音乐和乐器的未来趋势。
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage, so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.	为了现场演示个性化乐器， 我想邀请两位嘉宾到台上。
So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey.	掌声有请，亚当•布朗杰，麻省理工媒体实验室的博士生 和丹•埃尔西。
Dan, thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury.	 感谢TED，感谢庞巴迪·佛里士杰 丹今天从图斯伯里远道而来，他在那里住院。
This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that, because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.	 他是因为要和大家见面并分享自已的音乐，才特意来这里的。
So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?	丹，先自我介绍一下，好吗？
Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey.	丹•埃尔西：你们好，我叫丹•埃尔西。
I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.	我34岁，是一名脑瘫患者。
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software.	我一直都很热爱音乐，能用这样的新软件来指挥我的乐曲， 我感到非常激动。
Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan.	托德•麦克弗（以下简称托德）：你能来这里，我们真的也很激动。
So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago, when we started working at Tewksbury.	我们和丹大约在三年半前相识， 那时我们刚开始和图斯伯里医院合作。
Everybody we met there was fantastic, did fantastic music.	那里我们遇到的每一个人都妙极了， 能作出美妙的曲子。
Dan had never made music before, and it turned out he was really fantastic at it.	丹此前从来没有作曲，但出乎意料的是， 他长于此道。
He's a born composer.	他天生就是个作曲家。
He's very shy, too.	他也很害羞。
So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours.	嗯，他是一个非常棒的作曲家。
He has made many, many pieces.	从那以后， 我们就成了固定合作者。丹作了许多许多曲子，
He makes his own CDs.	发行了自己的CD唱片。
Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area -- mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.	其实在波士顿地区，他知名度很高， 还教授医院的人们和当地的孩子如何创作音乐。
And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.	下面请亚当来讲，他是麻省理工学院的博士生， 音乐技术和医药方面的专家，和丹有着密切的合作。
What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces, but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.	亚当所做的不但使丹能够 轻轻松松作曲， 而且使他能用个性化乐器来演奏自己的作品。
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?	怎么样，谈谈你们是怎么做的吧？
Adam Boulanger: Yes.	亚当•布朗杰：好。
So, Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person, and he's an intelligent and creative person.	图斯伯里医院的项目源自 我和托德的一次讨论，那时我们谈到丹是个非常有表现欲、 聪明而且有创造力的人。
And it's in his face, it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes.	你可以从 他的一举一动里看出来。
How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music?	为什么他就不能演奏一段属于自己乐曲呢？
That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.	同样，这也是我们的责任。
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance, with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that, to be able to perform his piece of music.	于是我们着手研发一种技术， 让他用微小的动作和精准的操控，来演奏自己的作品， 而对自己肢体的不便不必介意。
So, the process and the technology -- basically, first we needed an engineering solution.	嗯，谈到流程和技术， 简言之，首先需要一个工程之道。
So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.	你看， 我们放置了一台1394火线接口的摄像头来追踪红外指针。
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller.	我们利用了丹在言语控制中使用的肢体语言 和表意系统。
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know, the design process.	设计流程是不太有趣的一部份。 我们需要一些输入、持续的跟踪 以及软件来监测他做出的不同形状。
But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part, where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?	 简单的讲吧，我们在医院现场编程，和丹密切合作， 理解他是如何动作，
What's useful to him as an expressive motion?	哪些具有表现力的动作是他觉得有用的。
You know, what's his metaphor for performance?	再如，他用什么手法来演奏？
What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music?	哪些是他觉得重要， 并可以用于控制和传达音乐的东西？
So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan.	可以说，所有的参数、所有的技术， 都是为丹量身定做的。
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift.	嗯，我觉得，这也是未来的趋势。
It's not that our technologies -- they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.	 并非是技术本身打开了创新之门。
But what about expression?	是表达么？
What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work?	是艺术家创作作品的那一刻吗？
You know, do our technologies allow us to express?	 我们的技术有给大家表述的机会么？
Do they provide structure for us to do that?	他们有提供这样的构架吗？
And, you know, that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere.	其实，是人与人之间的联系 产生了表达，而这恰是技术本身所不能的。
So, you know, with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.	 于是，我们需要新的设计流程和工程流程， 来了解丹的动作以及表达方式，方便他来表演，
And so that's what we'll do today.	这便是今天我们所要做的。
TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now?	托德：我们开始吧，丹，要告诉大家 你将要演奏什么吗？
DE: This is "My Eagle Song."	丹：我的鹰之颂。
TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".	托德：丹将演奏他的乐曲鹰之颂。
In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece, completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.	这是他的乐谱， 完全由他用超级乐谱完成的。
So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.	他用红外追踪器来操作软件。
He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.	他用起软件来，出乎意料的快，事实上，比我还快呢。
TM: He's really modest, too.	丹：呜呜呀呀…… 托德：他太谦虚了，哈哈。
So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.	他使用了软件，从乐音和旋律开始，
He can place those exactly where he wants.	他可以把它们放置在自己想要的地方。
Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window, draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to.	每个元素都有色彩，回到编曲窗口， 画线，把这些东西放到他所想要的位置。
Looking at the Hyperscore, you can see it also, you can see where the sections are, something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end.	 看着超级乐谱， 你可以观察到音乐的 起承转合。
So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says, we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.	这就是他作曲的方法。正如亚当所说的， 我们找到了让他演奏的最好的办法。
It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements, it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.	摄像头会监控丹，分析他的动作， 让他随心所欲地展示他音乐的方方面面。
And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.	你还会看到荧屏上的视觉特效。
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.	我的一位学生负责视觉采样。
But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.	其实这里并非是原封不动地显示相机跟踪的物体， 我们把采集的数据转化成了影像， 以便显示基本的运动和分析的方法。
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement, that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise, very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.	我觉得这些影像有助于大家理解我们是如何提取丹的动作。 如果观察他表演时的举动， 屏幕上的影像还能展现丹的动作目的明确、精准、 有专业素养，并且很优美。
So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.	正如我先前提到的，在听他的作品时， 重点是音乐棒极了，它会告诉你一个真实的丹。
So, are we ready Adam?	亚当，准备好了么？
Yeah.	亚当：好啦。
TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.	托德：好，有请丹为大家表演他的作品鹰之颂。
TM: Bravo.	托德：太棒了。
This is the venue where, as a young man, some of the music that I wrote was first performed.	就是这个地方 那时我还年轻 我的音乐首演就是在这里
It was, remarkably, a pretty good sounding room.	特别强调一下，这是一个 声音效果非常棒的房间
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere, it actually sounded pretty good.	墙面凹凸不平，到处都是垃圾 它的音效实际上却非常不错
This is a song that was recorded there.	这首歌就是在那里录制的
This is not Talking Heads, in the picture anyway.	不过照片里的 还不是传声头像
" by Talking Heads) So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood.	（音乐：A Clean Break  传声头像） 这房间的结构 让吐字变得易于理解
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.	歌词很容易听清
The sound system was kind of decent.	音响系统相当不错
And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.	房间里的混响也不太大
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too, pretty concise.	因此旋律 保存得相当完好 相当凝练
Other places around the country had similar rooms.	国内还有很多地方有这样的房间
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.	这是纳什维尔的Tootsies Orchid Lounge
The music was in some ways different, but in structure and form, very much the same.	这里的音乐有些不同 但结构和形式 却很相似
The clientele behavior was very much the same too.	客人的行为习惯也很类似
And so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough -- the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down, shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing.	因此在Tootsies和 CBGB（纽约传奇摇滚音乐俱乐部）里表演的乐队 都必须演奏得非常大声—— 音量要大得足以压过 人们跌倒、大吼大叫 或者发出的其他声音
Since then, I've played other places that are much nicer.	在那以后，我还在其他 更高级的场所表演过
I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that.	我在这里的迪斯尼音乐厅 或是卡内基音乐厅之类的地方演奏过
And it's been very exciting.	都是激动人心的经历
But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written, or was writing at the time, didn't sound all that great in some of those halls.	但我也发现，有时候 我之前 或是当时谱写的歌曲 在其中的一些音乐厅 表现得并不理想
We managed, but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made.	我们尽量做了调整 但有些时候，那些地方 和我创作的音乐 就是显得不太协调
So I asked myself: Do I write stuff for specific rooms?	我问自己 我是不是在为着什么特定的场所 进行创作呢？
Do I have a place, a venue, in mind when I write?	在我创作时，脑海中 是不是有一个地点、一个场所呢？
Is that a kind of model for creativity?	这算不算是一种创作模式呢？
Do we all make things with a venue, a context, in mind?	我们创作时是不是 脑海中都有着某个场所、某个情境？
Okay, Africa.	好了，这是非洲
Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa.	（音乐： Wenlenga / 多名艺术家) 当今我们所知的大部分流行音乐 有很大一部分是源于西非的
And the music there, I would say, the instruments, the intricate rhythms, the way it's played, the setting, the context, it's all perfect. It all works perfect.	而这里的音乐 要我说，这乐器 这复杂的节奏 演奏的方式，背景，情境 一切都很完美，协调得天衣无缝
The music works perfectly in that setting.	在那种背景下，这样的音乐是完美的
It's no accident.	这不是偶然的
It's perfect for that particular context.	这音乐只在特定情境下才表现得如此完美
And it would be a mess in a context like this.	如果改成这样的场所 那就会一团糟。
This is a gothic cathedral.	这是一座哥特式大教堂
In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.	（音乐：Spem In Alium 托马斯·塔利斯） 在哥特式大教堂，这类的音乐才是完美的
It actually improves it.	这里是巴赫为其 创作乐曲的地方。这是管风琴
This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for. This is the organ.	这里并没有哥特式大教堂那么大 所以他可以创作更繁复的作品
I think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.	我想大概是1770年左右的建筑
They're smaller, even less reverberant, so he can write really frilly music that's very intricate -- and it works.	它们空间更小，混响也更小 所以他能作出可谓华丽的曲子 他的音乐非常繁复——而且效果甚佳
It fits the room perfectly.	（音乐：F小调奏鸣曲 乌夫冈·A·莫扎特） 它完美地契合了这个房间
This is La Scala.	这是斯卡啦剧院
It's around the same time, I think it was built around 1776.	它和之前的那个房间差不多建造于同一时期 我想大概建于1776年
People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built, they used to yell out to one another.	在歌剧院建成的时期 里面的听众常常互相嚷嚷
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage, just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.	他们经常一边大吃大喝，一边和舞台上的人大喊大叫 就像CBGB这类场所的观众一样
If they liked an aria, they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore, not at the end of the show, but immediately.	如果他们喜欢其中一段咏叹调 会大喊着建议 这一段再演一次 不是在演出最后再演一次，而是马上重演
And well, that was an opera experience.	嗯，那就是看歌剧的经验之谈
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.	这是瓦格纳自己建造的歌剧院
And the size of the room is not that big.	剧院的规模不是很大
It's smaller than this.	比这里要小
But Wagner made an innovation.	但是瓦格纳进行了革新
He wanted a bigger band.	他想要一支更大的乐队
He wanted a little more bombast, so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there.	多一点浮华的感觉 于是他增加了乐池的面积 这样就可以容纳更多的低音乐器
Okay.	（音乐：罗恩格林/第三幕序曲 理查德·瓦格纳） 好了
This is Carnegie Hall.	这是卡内基音乐厅
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.	这类的建筑显然已经流行起来
The halls got bigger.	音乐厅规模更大。
Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.	卡内基音乐厅的大小和集市差不多
It's larger than some of the other symphony halls.	比一些交响乐厅还大
And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala.	那里的混响比 斯卡拉剧院的更大
Around the same, according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker, this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet -- no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage, or gossiping with one another during the show.	与此同时 根据Alex Ross给《纽约客》所写的文章可以看出 这样的规则孕育而生： 观众必须保持安静 在演出的过程中，不能再吃吃喝喝 向舞台上大喊大叫 或者和别人交头接耳
They had to be very quiet.	他们必须非常安静
So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls.	结合这两件事来看 有一种不同类型的音乐 在这样的音乐厅中效果最好
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics, which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music.	它可以气势磅礴 这是之前某些 种类的音乐所不具有的
Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting.	安静的部分也听得到 虽然很容易被 悄悄话和叫喊声淹没
But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall, the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural.	但由于混响的关系 在卡内基音乐厅之类的地方 音乐的节奏得稍微降低 质地却稍微提高
This is Mahler.	（音乐：降E大调第八交响曲 古斯塔夫·马勒） 这是马勒
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.	虽然看上去像鲍勃·迪伦，但这确实是马勒
That was Bob's last record, yeah.	哈，这是鲍勃的最后一张唱片
Popular music, coming along at the same time.	流行音乐同时也诞生了
This is a jazz band.	这是一支爵士乐队
According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs.	据斯科特·乔普林所说，这支乐队曾经 在游船和夜总会中表演过
Again, it's noisy.	这一次的环境又很嘈杂。
They're playing for dancers.	他们为跳舞的人伴奏
There's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked.	有些段落舞者特别喜欢 ——一首歌中有好几个段落
And they'd say, "Play that part again."	他们会说：把那部分再演奏一次。
Well, there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.	有很多时候 为了满足舞者，你会一次又一次地演奏同一个段落
So the bands started to improvise new melodies.	因此，乐队开始即兴创作新的曲子
And a new form of music was born.	一种音乐的新类型诞生了
These are played mainly in small rooms.	（音乐：皇家花园蓝调 W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters） 爵士乐主要在空间较小的室内演奏
People are dancing, shouting and drinking.	人们跳舞、叫喊、畅饮
So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that.	所以，音乐的声音必须够大 盖过别的声音
Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music, whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.	有些事情成真了。——那是在这个世纪之初 对整个20世纪的流行音乐来说 无论是摇滚还是拉丁音乐
[Live music] doesn't really change that much.	对音乐的改变都不是很大
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century, when this became one of the primary venues for music.	但当它成为音乐的主要媒介之一后 在20世纪的前30年间 流行音乐就发生了很大改变
And this was one way that the music got there.	而这是音乐传播到那里的 方法之一
Microphones enabled singers, in particular, and musicians and composers, to completely change the kind of music that they were writing.	麦克风完全改变了 音乐家、作曲家 特别是歌手 创作的作品
So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music, but singers, like Frank Sinatra, could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone.	迄今为止，收音机上大多播放的都是现场演奏 但有些歌手，比如法兰克·辛纳屈 可以用麦克风 制造一些 不用麦克风根本无法达到的效果
Other singers after him went even further.	在他之后，更有一些歌手 把这种做法发扬光大
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.	这种效果 没有麦克风绝对做不出来
And he's singing right into your ear.	如果没有录成唱片，那也无法达到
He's whispering into your ears.	他就在你的耳畔歌唱
The effect is just electric.	在你的耳畔低语
It's like the guy is sitting next to you, whispering who knows what into your ear.	这种效果就像过了电一样
So at this point, music diverged.	仿佛歌手就坐在你的身边 和你说着什么东西
There's live music, and there's recorded music.	从那个时候起，音乐开始分化
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.	既有现场音乐 也有唱片音乐
Now there's venues like this, a discotheque, and there's jukeboxes in bars, where you don't even need to have a band.	它们不再完全相同
There doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever, and the sound systems are good.	现在还有迪斯科舞厅这样的地方 在酒吧里也有自动点唱机 这些地方就不需要乐队了
People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems.	不需要那些 现场乐队之类的角色 那里的音响不错
Live performance, when it was incredibly successful, ended up in what is probably, acoustically, the worst sounding venues on the planet: sports stadiums, basketball arenas and hockey arenas.	（音乐：Rappers Delight The Sugarhill Gang） 歌手会即兴创作歌词 就像爵士演奏者会即兴创作曲子一样
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.	此外，还诞生了新的音乐模式
They wrote what is now called arena rock, which is medium-speed ballads.	现场演出，它取得了空前的成功 而它诞生的场所从音响效果上来看 这恐怕是世界上最不适合听音乐的地方了 体育场 篮球场，还有冰球场
They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for.	音乐家们尽了最大努力
The tempos are medium. It sounds big.	他们创作了舞台摇滚 听起来像是中速的谣曲
It's more a social situation than a musical situation.	（音乐：I Still Havent Found What Im Looking For U2） 他们已经尽了全力 写出了这样的歌曲
And in some ways, the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly.	节拍不快不慢，听起来很浑厚
I grew up with a radio in a car.	我是在汽车中的收音机边长大的
But now that's evolved into something else.	但如今它进化了
The car is a whole venue.	整辆汽车变成了一个环境
The music that, I would say, is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it.	（音乐：Who U Wit Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz） 这种音乐，让我说，是写给 汽车音响系统的 完美地匹配了这个环境
It might not be what you want to listen to at home, but it works great in the car -- has a huge frequency spectrum, you know, big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle.	这也许不是你想在家里听的音乐 但在车子里听起来却很棒—— 频谱很宽 重低音，发烧天碟，你懂的 人声一般集中在中频
Automobile music, you can share with your friends.	我们可以和朋友一起享受汽车音乐
There's one other kind of new venue, the private MP3 player.	还有另一种新的环境 私人MP3播放器
Presumably, this is just for Christian music.	这一个大概只用来听基督教音乐吧
And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall, or when the audience had to hush up, because you can now hear every single detail.	在某个方面，这和卡内基音乐厅有点像 听音乐的人必须安静 因为你能听到所有的细节
In other ways, it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet, you turn it up, and the next minute, your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.	在别的方面，它又更像西非音乐 因为如果MP3播放器里的音乐太过于安静 你把音量调高了，而下一秒钟 你的耳朵会被另一段嘈杂的音乐震聋
So that doesn't really work.	所以这并不很好用
I think pop music, mainly, it's written today, to some extent, is written for these kind of players, for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail, but the dynamic doesn't change that much.	我想，当前创作的 大多数流行音乐 可以说是写给这类播放器 这种个人体验的 你能听出细枝末节 又不怎么改变音乐的本质
So I asked myself: Okay, is this a model for creation, this adaptation that we do?	我自问 好了，这是不是 一种创作的模式呢？ 我们是不是在适应环境呢？
And does it happen anywhere else?	这又是不是放之四海而皆准呢？
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people, birds do it too -- that the birds in the canopy, where the foliage is dense, their calls tend to be high-pitched, short and repetitive.	根据大卫·爱登堡（David Attenborough，著名生物纪录片主持人）和其他人所说 鸟儿们也是这么做的 树冠上的鸟 在树枝浓密的地方 它们的叫声通常 调子更高，急促，反复
And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls, so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor.	而地面上的鸟 叫声通常调子更低 这样当它们在森林的地面上蹦蹦跳跳时 声音也不会被扰乱
Other birds, like this tanager, have adapted within the same species.	其他的鸟，像这只唐纳雀 是同一鸟种中适应环境后的种类
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.	对，我想这是一种进化
It's adaptive.	一种适应能力
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there.	但乐趣、激情和愉悦 仍然存在
This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view.	这是和传统的浪漫情怀 正好相反的观点
The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion, and then somehow it gets shaped into something.	在浪漫的观点看来 首先有激情 然后才有洋溢的感情 接着，它再被塑造成不同的东西
And I'm saying, well, the passion's still there, but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into, that is instinctively and intuitively created first.	我要说 的确，激情不可或缺 但容器 那即将被填满、充实的容器 在最初就根据直觉 已经创造出来了
We already know where that passion is going.	我们之前就知道激情会走向何方
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting.	然而，这两个观点冲突的地方有一点挺有趣
The writer, Thomas Frank, says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests, that voters, like a lot of us, assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere, that it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate, that it's more authentic.	一名作家 托马斯·弗兰克 曾说 也许有一种解释可以说明 为什么有些选民 给自己利益的对立面投了一票 这些选民和我们的大多数人一样 假设，如果他们觉得某一方听起来很真诚 发自内心，激情洋溢 那一方就是更可靠的
And they'll vote for that.	他们会投上一票
So that, if somebody can fake sincerity, if they can fake passion, they stand a better chance of being selected in that way, which seems a little dangerous.	所以，如果有人假装真诚 假装富有激情 靠着这种方法，当然有一点风险 但他们就有更大的机会 被选上
I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy, are not mutually exclusive.	我要说，激情和快乐 并不是势不两立的
Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds.	或许，世界现在需要我们认识到 我们就像鸟儿
We adapt.	我们适应环境
We sing.	我们歌唱
And like the birds, the joy is still there, even though we have changed what we do to fit the context.	也和鸟儿一样，快乐仍在 即使我们改变了做法 为了适应环境
Thank you very much.	非常感谢
For a long time in my life, I felt like I'd been living two different lives.	在我生命中非常长的一段时间内， 我感觉我在过着两种不同的人生。
There's the life that everyone sees, and then there's the life that only I see.	一个是每个人都看见的人生， 另一个是只有我能看见的人生。
And in the life that everyone sees, who I am is a friend, a son, a brother, a stand-up comedian and a teenager.	在每个人都能看见的人生里， 我的角色是一个朋友、 儿子、兄弟、 喜剧演员和一名青少年。
That's the life everyone sees.	这是每个人都看到的人生。
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me, that's what they would tell you.	如果你要问我的朋友和家人来形容我， 这是他们会告诉你的。
And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.	这是很大一部分的我 这是我在这社会上的角色
And if you were to ask me to describe myself, I'd probably say some of those same things.	如果你要我自己来形容我， 我可能会说一些与上相同的东西。
And I wouldn't be lying, but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either, because the truth is, that's just the life everyone else sees.	我不会说谎， 但也不会完全会告诉你真相， 因为事实是， 这就是其他人看到的人生。
In the life that only I see, who I am, who I really am, is someone who struggles intensely with depression.	另外一个人生只有我自己能看到 我是谁 我其实是 一个与抑郁症激烈斗争的人。
I have for the last six years of my life, and I continue to every day.	在生命中的近六年来 我与抑郁症斗争 也会在接下来的每一天内继续斗争。
Now, for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn't really know what that means, that might surprise them to hear, because there's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong, when you break up with your girlfriend, when you lose a loved one, when you don't get the job you wanted.	对于从未经历过抑郁的人 或不太知道这是什么意思的人， 他们听到这些也许会感到诧异， 因为在社会上有普遍的误解认为说 抑郁症只是在当你生命中出了什么差错的时候 会难过， 当你和你的女朋友分手 当你失去心爱的人， 当你找不到理想的工作的时候。
But that's sadness.	但这只是悲伤。
That's a natural thing.	这是一件很自然的事情。
That's a natural human emotion.	这是自然的人类情感。
Real depression isn't being sad when something in your life goes wrong.	真正的抑郁不是 当你生命中出了差错的时候悲伤。
Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right.	真正的抑郁是 当你生活中的一切都好的时候悲伤。
That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from.	那才是真正的抑郁，而那才是我所遭受的。
And to be totally honest, that's hard for me to stand up here and say.	坦诚说， 出现在这里并且把它公之于众是一件很难的事。
It's hard for me to talk about, and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about, so much so that no one's talking about it.	我很难去把它诉说， 这似乎也很难让每个人去谈这一点， 以至于没有人去谈它。
And no one's talking about depression, but we need to be, because right now it's a massive problem.	没有人会去谈抑郁， 但我们需要去谈论它 因为现在它一个很大的问题。
It's a massive problem.	这是一个巨大的问题。
But we don't see it on social media, right?	但我们并没有看到它出现在媒体上，对吗？
We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.	我们没有在 Facebook 上看到它 我们也没有在 Twitter 上看到它。
We don't see it on the news, because it's not happy, it's not fun, it's not light.	我们也没有在新闻上看到它，因为它不是快乐的， 是不有趣的，也不是光明的。
And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.	于是，正因为我们看不到它， 所以我们没有意识到它的严重性。
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this: every 30 seconds, every 30 seconds, somewhere, someone in the world takes their own life because of depression, and it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away, it might be two continents away, but it's happening, and it's happening every single day.	然而它的确很严重： 每隔 30 秒钟， 每隔 30 秒，在某个地方， 在这个世界上的某个人就在 因为抑郁而自杀， 它有可能是在两个街区之外， 它也可能在两个国家之外， 它可能是两个大洲之外， 但它正在发生， 而且每一天都在发生着。
And we have a tendency, as a society, to look at that and go, "So what?"	作为一个社会 我们有一种趋势， 看着这种情况会说，那又怎样?
So what?	那又怎样？
We look at that, and we go, "That's your problem.	我们知道这个情况然后说， 这是你的问题。
That's their problem."	这是他们的问题。
We say we're sad and we say we're sorry, but we also say, "So what?"	我们说我们很难过，我们说我们感到很抱歉， 但我们还说，那又怎样?
Well, two years ago it was my problem, because I sat on the edge of my bed where I'd sat a million times before and I was suicidal.	好吧，两年前，它是我的问题， 因为我坐在我的床边 曾坐过千百万次的床边 想着要自杀。
I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface, you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.	我有自杀倾向， 但如果你从表面上看我的生活， 你不会看到一个自杀倾向的孩子。
You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team, the drama and theater student of the year, the English student of the year, someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party.	你会看到一个篮球队队长、 今年戏剧班的学生、 今年学习英语的学生、 一个经常出现在荣誉榜上的 和一个经常出现在任何派对上的人。
So you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say I wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.	所以你会说我不是抑郁，你会说 我不是自杀，但你就错了。
You would be wrong.	你就错了。
So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it.	所以我那天晚上坐在床上 旁边是一瓶药，我手上拿着纸笔 我想着要终结自己的生命 我差一点点就做了
I came this close to doing it.	我差点就这样做了。
And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones, one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump, one of the lucky ones who survives.	然而我没有 所以我成为了幸运的一份子， 一个人从边缘中走下来的人 我从我的人生大楼向下看但并没有跳下去， 我是幸运活下来的人之一。
Well, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story, and my story is this: In four simple words, I suffer from depression.	嗯，我活下来了，那让我跟我的故事并存， 我的故事是： 简单的四个字，患抑郁症。
I suffer from depression, and for a long time, I think, I was living two totally different lives, where one person was always afraid of the other.	我患上抑郁症， 在很长时间，我想， 我在活着两个完全不同的人生， 一个总是害怕别人的人。
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was, that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was, that beneath my smile, there was struggle, and beneath my light, there was dark, and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain.	我害怕人们会看到我真实的样子， 并不是一个每个人都认为我是的样子： 高中的风光小孩，我其实并不完美 在我的微笑下面是斗争， 在我的光明下面是黑暗， 在我的人格下藏着更深层次的痛苦。
See, some people might fear girls not liking them back.	比如有些人害怕喜欢的女生不喜欢他。
Some people might fear sharks.	有些人可能害怕鲨鱼。
Some people might fear death.	 有些人可能会害怕死亡。
But for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.	但对我来说， 我生命中的很大一部分是害怕我自己。
I feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability, and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner, like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out, and so I thought about that way every single day.	我害怕真相，我害怕诚实，我害怕脆弱， 这种恐惧让我感觉到 就像我被被逼迫到一个角落里， 就像我被逼到角落里，只有一个出路， 于是，我每一天都这样想。
I thought about it every single day, and if I'm being totally honest, standing here I've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness, that's the struggle, that's depression, and depression isn't chicken pox.	我每一天都这样想， 如果我完全诚实的站在这里 我告诉你我有再次想过，因为这就是疾病， 这就是斗争，那是抑郁， 抑郁症不是水痘。
You don't beat it once and it's gone forever.	你不是抗争一次过，它就永远离开了。
It's something you live with.	它跟你相依为命。
It's something you live in.	它是你生命里的东西。
It's the roommate you can't kick out.	它是你不能踢出去的室友。
It's the voice you can't ignore.	它是你不能忽视的杂音。
It's the feelings you can't seem to escape, the scariest part is that after a while, you become numb to it.	它是你不能逃脱的情感， 最可怕的是过了一段时间， 你变得麻木。
It becomes normal for you, and what you really fear the most isn't the suffering inside of you.	它对于你来说已经很正常了， 你真正最害怕的 不是你内心的痛苦。
It's the stigma inside of others, it's the shame, it's the embarrassment, it's the disapproving look on a friend's face, it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak, it's the comments that you're crazy.	这是在别人眼里的耻辱 它是耻辱，是尴尬， 它是朋友脸上不赞成的表情， 它是走廊的低语， 轻声说你太懦弱， 它是你疯了的评语。
That's what keeps you from getting help.	这就是让你得不到帮助的原因。
That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.	这就是让你它控制它和隐藏它的原因。
It's the stigma.	因为这是一种耻辱。
So you hold it in and you hide it, and you hold it in and you hide it, and even though it's keeping you in bed every day and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it, you hide it, because the stigma in our society around depression is very real.	 所以你控制它和隐藏它， 你控制它个隐藏它， 即使它让你每一天待在床上 它让你的人生感到空虚无论你怎样努力地去填补它， 你隐藏它，因为在我们的社会中 有关抑郁症的耻辱感是非常真实的。
It's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this: Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you're having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you're depressed?	它很真实，如果你认为它不是，问问你自己： 你想让你的下一个 Facebook 状态是 说你很难下床 因为你背有伤 还是你很难下床 是因为你抑郁？
That's the stigma, because unfortunately, we live in a world where if you break your arm, everyone runs over to sign your cast, but if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.	这是耻辱，因为不幸的是， 我们生活在一个如果你的胳膊伤了， 大家都跑过去要在你的石膏上签名， 但如果你告诉人们你抑郁， 每个人跑向了另外一边。
That's the stigma.	而这就是耻辱。
We are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains.	我们是如此接受任何身体部位受损 除了我们的大脑。
And that's ignorance.	 这是一种无知。
That's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created a world that doesn't understand depression, that doesn't understand mental health.	纯粹的无知，制造这种无知的是 一个不了解抑郁症的世界 不懂心理健康的世界。
And that's ironic to me, because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world, yet it's one of the least discussed.	对于我来说这很讽刺， 因为抑郁 是我们这世界上最有迹可循的问题之一 然而它是最少被讨论的话题之一。
It hasn't, and it's not going to, because that's wishful thinking, and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination, and we can't procrastinate on something this important.	它不会、它没有、也不即将要， 因为那只是一厢情愿， 一厢情愿不是一个游戏计划，它是拖沓， 而我们不能拖延这么重要的事情。
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one.	解决任何问题的第一步 是认识到这一问题的存在。
Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.	我们还没能做到，所以我们不能期待 当我们还在害怕问题的时候找到答案。
And I don't know what the solution is.	我不知道该解决方案是什么。
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think, I think it has to start here.	我希望我知道，但我不知道 但我认为， 我认为它已经在这里开始。
It has to start with me, it has to start with you, it has to start with the people who are suffering, the ones who are hidden in the shadows.	它和我一同开始， 它与你一同开始， 它与遭受过的人们一同开始， 那些被隐藏在阴影中的人们。
We need to speak up and shatter the silence.	我们需要说出来打破沉默。
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in, because if there's one thing that I've come to realize, if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem, it's not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others.	我们需要成为那些为我们相信的事情而勇敢的人， 因为如果有一件事是我认识到的，那就是， 如果有一件事是我知道是最要紧的问题， 它并不是创造一个 我们消除他人的无知的世界。
It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves, where we're okay with who we are, because when we get honest, we see that we all struggle and we all suffer.	而是创造一个我们接受自己的世界， 接受我们真实的自己， 因为当我们诚实面对的时候， 我们会看到我们所有的斗争和所有的苦难。
Whether it's with this, whether it's with something else, we all know what it is to hurt.	无论是抑郁症，还是别的事情， 我们都知道什么是痛苦的。
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart, and we all know how important it is to heal.	我们都知道我们的心中有苦 我们也知道去疗伤有多重要。
But right now, depression is society's deep cut that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.	但是现在，抑郁症是社会的伤口 我们习惯于把创口贴贴上就假装它不存在。
Well, it is there.	而它是存在的。
It is there, and you know what?	而且你知道么？
It's okay.	它并没什么。
Depression is okay.	抑郁症没什么。
If you're going through it, know that you're okay.	因为如果你克服了它，你就知道你没事。
And know that you're sick, you're not weak, and it's an issue, not an identity, because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others, you can see depression for what it really is, and that's just a part of life, just a part of life, and as much as I hate, as much as I hate some of the places, some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to, in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.	知道虽然你病了，但你并不脆弱， 它是一个问题，不是一个身份标签， 因为当你经历过你过去的恐惧和嘲笑 别人对你的看法和耻辱， 你就可以看到抑郁症真实的身份， 它只是生活的一部分， 只是生活的一部分，虽然我讨厌， 就像我讨厌的一些地方， 我生活的某一部分已经被抑郁症拖垮， 但在很多方面上我是非常感激的。
Because yeah, it's put me in the valleys, but only to show me there's peaks, and yeah it's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light.	因为它是让我经历低谷， 但只是为了向我证明有高峰， 是的，它将我拉进了黑暗， 但只是为了提醒我有光。
My pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet, has given me perspective, and my hurt, my hurt has forced me to have hope, have hope and to have faith, faith in myself, faith in others, faith that it can get better, that we can change this, that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance, fight back against intolerance, and more than anything, learn to love ourselves, learn to accept ourselves for who we are, the people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.	我的痛苦，比我在生活的十九年的任何事都能 给我看待事情的角度，而我的伤口 让我有了希望 有希望，有信念，对我自己的信念 对其他人的新年，可以更好的信念， 我们可以改变这一点，我们可以把它说出来 说出来与对抗无知， 反击不容忍， 还有一件比什么都重要的是，那就是， 学会爱自己， 学会接受我们自己， 我们不是别人想要我们成为的那个人。
Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.	因为我相信在这个世界上 拥抱光明并不意味着忽略黑暗。
The world I believe in is one where we're measured by our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.	我相信的世界是一个我们被评判的标准是 我们克服逆境的能力，不是逃避它们。
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say, "I'm going through hell," and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay, and it's okay because depression is okay.	我相信的世界是一个我可以看着某一个人的眼睛 并说，我正在过着地狱般的生活， 他们可以也看着我跟我说，我也是 这是可以接受的， 这没关系因为抑郁没什么。
We're people.	我们都是人。
We're people, and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness, then I'm here to tell you you're wrong.	我们是人，我们斗争、我们遭受痛苦 我们流血、我们哭， 如果你认为真正的力量 代表从未有任何弱点，那么我在这里 要告诉你你错了。
You're wrong, because it's the opposite.	你错了，因为它是相反的。
We're people, and we have problems.	我们是人，我们会有问题。
We're not perfect, and that's okay.	我们不是完美的，而这没什么。
So we need to stop the ignorance, stop the intolerance, stop the stigma, and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos, take a look at the truth, and start talking, because the only way we're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together, by standing strong together.	所以我们需要停止无知， 停止不容忍，停止蔑视， 和停止沉默， 我们需要打破禁忌， 真视真相，并开始说话， 因为唯一处理 人们单独作战的问题 就是坚强的站在一起， 坚强的站在一起。
And I believe that we can.	我相信我们可以。
I believe that we can.	我相信我们可以。
Thank you guys so much.	非常感谢。
This is a dream come true.	我的梦想成真了。
Thank you.	谢谢。
Thank you.	谢谢。
On March 14, this year, I posted this poster on Facebook.	今年3月14日 我在Facebook上发了这张海报
This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag.	一张我和女儿的相片 （海报上写着：伊朗的朋友们， 我们爱你们） 她手里拿着一面以色列国旗
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted.	让我来解释一下是什么事情促使我做这张海报 和我在什么样时候贴出这张海报的
A few days ago, I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store, and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other, and the owner was explaining to the client that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.	几天前我在一家杂货店 坐着排队 当时杂货店的老板和一名顾客 正在闲聊 老板对顾客说 以色列迟早将会遭受一万枚导弹的轰炸

This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel.	这就是这张海报的来由 这就是以色列的现状
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now, and we have people, you know, afraid.	十年来 我们和伊朗之间的战争阴云一直驱之不散 这让人们的心中充满了...恐惧
It's like every year it's the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran.	这些年我们总觉得如果我们不为和平作一些努力 战争将会一触即发
It's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever, for 10 years now.	我们总觉得如果我们现在不采取行动 我们将追悔莫及 这种状况已经持续了整整10年了
So at some point it became, you know, to me, I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before.	他们的对话触动了我 我是一个平面设计师 所以我设计了一些呼吁和平的海报 刚才你们看到的就是其中之一
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook, my friends like it, don't like it, most of the time don't like it, don't share it, don't nothing, and it's another day.	通常 我做好这些海报后就贴在 Facebook上就完事了 我的朋友的有的喜欢我的海报 有的不喜欢 我大部分的作品都没人喜欢 也没人分享 没人关心 直到有一天
So I went to sleep, and that was it for me.	我上完贴后就睡了 想着这些海报只是做给自己看
And later on in the night, I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night, and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots, you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.	可到半夜 我醒了过来 我常在半夜醒来 经过电脑时 我看到屏幕上有密密麻麻的红点 要知道 这在我的Facebook 上是从来没有过的情况
And I was like, "What's going on?"	我当时的反应是:什么情况？
So I come to the computer and I start looking on, and suddenly I see many people talking to me, most of them I don't know, and a few of them from Iran, which is -- What?	我坐到电脑前看发生了什么 我看到很多留言 他们当中绝大多数人我都不认识 里面竟然有伊朗人 真的太令人难以置信了
Because you have to understand, in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.	因为你要知道 在以色列 我们从不和伊朗人交谈
We don't know people from Iran.	我们也不认识任何伊朗人
It's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from -- it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.	以色列人在 Facebook 上的好友圈子 基本上也就是以色列人
And now people from Iran are talking to me.	但是现在我竟然在和伊朗人对话
So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come, because they don't have a computer, she asked her family to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.	于是 我和这名伊朗女孩交谈起来 她告诉我 她看到海报之后叫全家人一起看了 因为她们家只有一台电脑 看完后一家人坐在客厅里哭了
So I'm like, whoa.	我当时觉得，哇，太惊讶了。
I ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.	我叫醒妻子 跟她说你一定要看看这个
People are crying, and she came, she read the text, and she started to cry.	有一家伊朗人被我的海报弄哭了 我妻子看完留言后也哭了
And everybody's crying now.	大家全哭了
So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex, as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody what I'd just seen, and people started to see them and to share them, and that's how it started.	我有点手足无措 而我作为一名平面设计师， 我的直接反应就是----让别人也看到我刚才所看到的一切 后来, 关注我的海报的人越来越多 并且开始分享转发我的海报 故事就这样开始了
The day after, when really it became a lot of talking, I said to myself, and my wife said to me, I also want a poster, so this is her.	第二天，围绕着该话题的讨论越来越多 我妻子对我说 也给我做张海报-----我们的想法不谋而合 瞧 这就是她
Because it's working, put me in a poster now.	我的海报引起了人们的关注
But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work, but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel who want to say something.	但是细想一下 海报之所以引起关注 不是因为我自己，而是以色列公民 想要表达自己的想法
So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want, and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.	于是我开始寻找身边愿意上海报的人 给他们拍照 做成海报 放到网络上分享这些海报
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.	所以，我对我的邻居、朋友、学生说 给我一张照片 我为你制一张海报
And that's how it started. And that's how, really, it's unleashed, because suddenly people from Facebook, friends and others, just understand that they can be part of it.	就这样，我们开始做这些海报 可没想到,事情竟一发不可收拾 我Facebook 上的朋友、身边的朋友还有其他人 在意识到他们也可以为此做些事后全参与进来了
It's not just one dude making one poster, it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures and ask me, "Make me a poster.	这并不是做一张海报的事情 而是人人都可以参与其中 所以他们开始给我发照片 并要求我，帮我做张海报，贴出来。
Post it.	
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."	告诉伊朗人我们以色列人爱他们。

It was a huge amount of pictures.	照片的数量非常巨大
So for a few days, that's how my living room was.	所以 那些天我的客厅就是这个样子的
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images, but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.	我们不仅收到以色列人的海报和照片 我们也收到很多伊朗人的评论和留言
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it, because I know people: They don't read, they see images.	然后 我们将这些留言做成海报贴出来 因为我深知: 人们都喜欢看图片,厌恶阅读文本
If it's an image, they may read it.	如果把留言做成图片，他们可能会去看。
So here are a few of them.	下面 我们来看一下我们做的一些海报
This one is really moving for me because it's the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning, and now that she sees the posters that we're sending, she starts -- she said that she changed her mind, and now she loves that blue, she loves that star, and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag, and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another, and just a few days after I posted the first poster.	（很高兴认识你！你是我第一个以色列人朋友。我希望我们不要被我们两国愚蠢的政客们操控着去做傻事了 （我喜欢你们以色列国旗上的蓝色，喜欢那个六角星，喜欢这面旗帜。
They have graphic designers.	他们也有平面设计师。
What?	不是吧？
So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces, but they want to spread the message.	他们想回应我们，他们的想法跟我们的是一样的。
They want to respond.	现在，对话渠道已经建立起来了。
They want to say the same thing.	这是双边对话，以色列人和伊朗人 相互给对方传达了同样内容的信息。
So.	（我的以色列朋友们。
And now it's communication.	我不恨你们。
It's a two-way story.	我不希望和你们打战。
It's Israelis and Iranians sending the same message, one to each other.	） 这种对话在以前是从来没有过的事。
This never happened before, and this is two people supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war, and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say, "I like this guy.	我们一直处在战争边缘， 彼此都视对方为敌人 但是突然间他们开始在 Facebook 上相互说 我喜欢这个人，我喜欢那些人。
I love those guys."	
And it became really big at some point.	某种意义上这是一个很大的改变。
So the guys on the news, they say, "Okay, let's talk about this."	然后突然间，爆出了一条这样正面的消息 所以记者们开始关注 他们说，嘿! 我们要报导这件事。
And they just came, and it was so much, I remember one day, Michal, she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him, "Who's gonna see the show?	然后记者们就来采访了，很多很多记者 我记得有一天，米哈尔， 记者在采访她。她问记者， 谁会看这条新闻？

Something crazy also happened.	更疯狂的事情还在后头。
Every time a country started talking about it, like Germany, America, wherever, a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories, so at the beginning we had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran?	当任何一个国家的人开始谈论这个话题时， 无论是德国人，美国人，还是别的国家的人， 他们的Facebook上都会弹出一个有着统一图标 有着相同表达的页面 来看看这张伊朗爱以色列海报。一个在德黑兰的伊朗人看到我们的以色列爱伊朗后 他说 以色列爱伊朗吗？
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."	那好，我来做一张伊朗爱以色列。
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel.	后来，还出现了巴勒斯坦爱以色列。
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago.	几天之前，又出现了黎巴嫩的版本。
And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message, to people sending their love, one to each other.	这是 Facebook 上有关这类信息的 网页的列表。 当我看到人们相互表达着他们的爱，
The moment I really understood that something was happening, a friend of mine told me, "Google the word 'Israel.'" And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran."	那一刻我真正感觉到有些事情正在改变。 我的一个朋友跟我说， Google一下以色列这个单词 这些图片就是那一段时间 你在谷歌中搜索伊朗或者以色列 排在最靠前的搜索结果。
We really changed how people see the Middle East.	我们真的改变了人们对中东的看法。
Because you're not in the Middle East.	由于你们并不住在中东地区
You're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East, so you go on Google and you say, "Israel," and they give you the bad stuff.	而住在其它地区，当你想要了解中东的时候， 你就会登录Google网站，搜索以色列， 然后搜到的都是坏消息。
And for a few days you got those images.	但是有那么一段时间你看到的是这些正面的图片。
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know, commented on one of the photos.	今天浏览以色列爱伊朗活动的页面 的人数达到80831人.。而上周超过两百万人 访问了该网页，浏览图片， 发表评论并分享了它们。
So for five months now, that's what we are doing, me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.	这就是我们过去五个月做的工作， 我、米哈尔、我的几个朋友，每天就只做这些海报。

Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran, lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us, decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel, and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says, "Okay, not that big a deal."	我在 Facebook 上认识一个女孩 她在伊朗出生、长大，现在住在德国， 从没去过以色列，曾经很害怕以色列人， 因为从小获得的知识就是这样的。 在网上跟一些以色列人聊了几个月之后 她决定到以色列看看。 她坐飞机抵达了本·古里安机场（以色列最大的机场） 然后说，其实以色列人没那么可怕啊。
So a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher, so we start this new campaign called "Not ready to die in your war."	几周前，局势又变得紧张起来， 于是我们发起了一个的新的运动 叫做我们不愿刀兵相见
I mean, it's plus/minus the same message, but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.	这个跟之前要传达的信息没有太大的差别， 但是我们这次想要表现的更加的激进一点。
And again, something amazing happened, something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.	跟之前一样，很多令人惊奇的事情发生了。 并且出现了上次活动没有出现过的奇妙的事情。
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent, you know, their foot and half their faces, now they're sending their faces, and they're saying, "Okay, no problem, we're into it.	来自伊朗的人，在上次的活动中还很小心谨慎地 只是在网上贴出他们自己的脚 和半张脸的相片， 现在他们露了全脸，并且宣布， OK，没问题，我们加入，让我们一起努力。

Let's talk trash.	让我们来说说垃圾吧
You know, we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.	我们曾经被告知 要放弃在大萧条时期和二战时建立起来的 强有力的环境保护道德意识

Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.	《生活杂志》在其中起了助推作用 宣称用完就丢的生活方式 以此将家庭主妇从洗涤碗碟的杂务中解放出来
Mental note to the liberators: throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.	但这些被解放的人们应该铭记在心的是： 丢弃塑料占据了大量空间且不能生物降解
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.	只有我们人类才能制造出大自然不能消化的废物
Plastics are also hard to recycle.	塑料同样也很难回收利用
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream.	一位老师告诉我，如果要形容 我们排放废物中不到5%的塑料垃圾回收率的话
It's diddly-point-squat.	可以用diddle point squat

It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge.	在水沸点以下塑料便开始熔化 而且塑料会像海绵一样 吸附油性污染物
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash.	每年回炉生产的1000亿颗塑料小球中 有一半会很快又变成垃圾
A large, unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea.	这些垃圾中的一大部分 将不可避免地经河流流入大海

And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday.	这是加州州立大学长滩分校附近的漂浮物 也是我们昨天参观的淡化水工厂所在地
In spite of deposit fees, much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.	尽管有回收报酬 但流向海洋的塑料垃圾绝大多数还是饮料瓶
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes, here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan, who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.	在美国，每五分钟我们就使用了两百万个饮料瓶 这张图片来自TED演讲者克里斯·乔丹 他巧妙地记录了我们消费掉的瓶子数目是多么巨大，这是放大后的细节
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California.	这个位于下加利福尼亚海域的偏远海岛 已经成为塑料瓶的储藏库
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.	无人居住的圣罗克岛是许多鸟类的栖息地 位于下加州人口稀少的中部海岸
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.	请注意这些瓶子上都有瓶盖
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET, will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.	塑料瓶由聚对苯二甲酸乙二醇酯制成 会沉入海水而不会漂到这么偏远的地方
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic, polypropylene.	然而，瓶盖来自另一些的工厂 由一种称为聚丙烯的塑料制成
They will float in seawater, but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.	它们会漂浮在海面上 不幸的是，瓶盖并不在退瓶法的回收名单中
Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo.	让我们追踪这数以百万计的瓶盖 看它们是如何漂向大海的
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific, while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.	一年时间里，来自日本的瓶盖横穿太平洋 我们的瓶盖则沿着加利福尼亚寒流漂行 起先到达的是卡波圣卢卡斯所在的纬度附近
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch, while ours litter the Philippines.	10年之后，大多数来自日本的瓶盖 漂到了所谓的东洋垃圾场 而我们扔掉的瓶盖则堆积到了菲律宾
After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre.	20年之后，我们看到在北太平洋环流区 出现了塑料碎片堆积带
It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks.	在西北夏威夷群岛国家保护地的两个环礁 库尔环礁和中途岛环礁上 生活着数以百万计的信天翁 它们在这片海域觅食，吃下能找到的所有一切 然后再回吐给幼鸟
but, mostly bottle caps.	但绝大部分是瓶盖
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface.	不幸的是，它们的父母将漂在大海表面的瓶盖 误认为是食物
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals.	瓶盖下的扣环 也会给水生动物带来威胁
This is Mae West, still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.	这只龟名叫Mae West 现在仍生活在新奥尔良一位动物园管理员的家中
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem, so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005 I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.	我想看看家乡长滩对这一问题作出的努力 因此，2005年的海岸清理日 我来到我们长滩市最东边的长滩半岛
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.	我们清理了这片狭长的沙滩
I offered five cents each for bottle caps.	每搜集一个瓶盖我付给5美分
I got plenty of takers.	许多人加入了行列
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.	这就是他们搜集的1100个瓶盖
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.	我想我要花上20美元
That day I ended up spending nearly 60.	而那天到最后我花了接近60美元
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.	我根据颜色将它们分类 并在接下来的地球日 在圣佩德罗的卡布里奥水族馆进行展览
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.	施瓦辛格州长和妻子玛丽亚路过并与我们讨论了这次展览
In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags, they shook my hand.	尽管我戴着用塑料购物袋编织成的女里女气的帽子 他们还是与我握了手
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton.	我给他和玛丽亚看了个浮游动物拖网 在夏威夷北部的涡流处 塑料的量比浮游生物还多
Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.	这就是在我们逐渐变成塑料汤的海洋中拖网得到的样品
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this.	在海面用浮游动物拖网拖动一英里 得到的样品就像这个
And this.	和这个
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this.	当塑料碎片冲上夏威夷沙滩的时候 看起来是这样的
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach, the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.	而这里就是凯鲁亚沙滩 我们的总统一家在前往华盛顿之前度假的那个沙滩
Now, how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton?	那么，我们是如何通过这些样品 分析得出塑料比浮游生物还多的结论呢？
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes, from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.	我们将塑料碎片按体积大小分成不同类别 从5毫米到1/3毫米
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.	少量塑料上浓缩的持续性有机污染物浓度 比周围海水高出一百万倍
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean, at the base of the food chain, was ingesting these poison pills.	我们想知道，深海里最普通的鱼类 位于食物链底部 是否也会吞下这些毒药丸
We did hundreds of necropsies, and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.	我们做了数百例尸体检验 在超过三分之一的鱼体胃里面都发现了塑料碎片
The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long, had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.	最高的记录来自一条仅2.5英寸的小鱼 它小小的胃里有84块塑料碎片
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.	这就是我们为子孙后代留下的遗产
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global.	一个无法控制的用完就扔的社会 已经成为全球问题
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.	我们实在没办法储存或回收所有生产的东西
We have to throw it away.	我们必须把它们扔掉
Now, the market can do a lot for us, but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.	现在，我们能利用市场做很多事情 但市场不能修补我们已经破坏了的海洋自然系统
All the king's horses and all the king's men ...	即使投入所有的人力物力
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.	也永远无法把海洋里所有的塑料垃圾清理干净
Narrator : The levels are increasing, the amount of packaging is increasing, the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating, and it's showing up in the ocean.	情况正在恶化 塑料包装的数量不断增加 用完就扔的生活方式大行其道 危害已经波及到了海洋
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.	主持人：他对把海洋清理干净感到希望渺茫
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.	把塑料从海水中过滤出来的成本 将超出任何国家的预算 过程中也可能导致海洋生物的死亡
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source: stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.	摩尔说，解决的方法要从塑料的来源着手 将塑料控制在陆地上，阻止其流入海洋
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world, he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.	而身处一个被塑料袋和塑料包装包围的世界 他对此也不抱太大希望
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline, in Long Beach, California.	这是布莱恩·鲁尼的《夜线》节目 发自加利福尼亚长滩市
Charles Moore: Thank you.	查尔斯·摩尔：谢谢。
How do you feed a city?	如何喂养一个城市？
It's one of the great questions of our time.	这是我们这个时代的一个重大问题之一。
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.	然而很少人会问这个问题。
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.	我们习以为常了， 我们走进商店的时候 走进餐厅的时候，或是一个小时后我们进入这个剧院的门厅 总会有食物等着我们 它们很神奇地从某个地方冒出来
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.	然而，当你想像每一天，在一个伦敦那么大的城市， 要生产足够的食物 运输、交易这些食物， 烹饪，食用，最后扔弃它们 而且类似的事情每天都发生着 在地球上的每一个城市都如此 每个城市都有食物供应，这件事很不可思议
We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were.	我们住在每天有食物供应的城市，仿佛 这是世界上最自然的事情， 我们忘记了我们也是动物， 所以我们需要进食， 事实上我们要依赖自然界 就如同我们的祖先要依赖自然界一样。
And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us.	随着我们越来越多人到城市生活， 越来越多的自然界正在 变成我身后的这些特别的景象 这是巴西Mata Grosso的大豆田 用来种食物养活我们
These are extraordinary landscapes, but few of us ever get to see them.	这些特别的景象 我们很少人亲眼目睹过
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either.	越来越多的这些地貌 不只是生产食物养活我们
As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals.	随着我们越来越多人移居城市 越来越多人吃肉 所以每年全球有三分之一的粮食 现在是用来喂动物 而不是喂养我们人类
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.	虽然说需要3倍的粮食 事实上却是10倍的食物 来喂养一个人，如果从喂养动物的粮食也计算在内 这并不是一个很有效率的喂养方式
And it's an escalating problem too.	这是一个越来越重要的问题
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities.	到2050年,预测有两倍的人口 将在城市居住
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed.	预测到也将需要两倍的 肉和奶类制品的消耗
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.	所以肉的消耗和城市化是共同发展的
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.	这就将引发一个很重大的问题
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050.	要喂养60亿的饥饿人口 在2050年
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.	这是个大问题.如果我们还像我们现在这么发展, 我们很可能没法在2050年解决这个问题
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land.	每年有1900万公顷的雨林消失 它们用作开垦新的耕地
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion.	尽管与此同时我们也失去等量的 现有耕地,因为盐碱化或水土流失
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.	我们也急需化石燃料
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West.	在欧洲，我们需要10卡路里的能量来生产1卡路里 为我们消耗的食物
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it.	尽管这些食物我们都是花了很多功夫才生产出来 事实上我们却不珍惜它们
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.	在美国有一半食物被扔弃
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.	最终,在这漫长过程的最后 我们将没法养活我们这个地球
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.	我们中10亿人肥胖,还有多于10亿的人处于饥饿中
None of it makes very much sense.	这些都没有道理
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture.	当你发现现在80%的全球食物贸易 仅由五家跨国公司控制, 这是挺可怕的
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.	随着我们搬进城市,世界正在接受西方的饮食
And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.	如果我们展望未来 这不是个可持续的饮食方式
So how did we get here?	我们怎么会走到这一步?
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?	更重要的是,我们应该怎么做?
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent.	先回答那个较简单的问题,首先 我想说,在大概1万年前 是这个过程的开始 在古代的中东地区 也就是广大的新月状的地区
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.	因为你可以看到它是新月形的
And it was also fertile.	同时它也是广大的
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.	就在这里,大概1万年前 2大伟大的发明 农业和城市化在此发生 几乎在同时,同一地点
This is no accident, because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.	这并不是偶然 因为农业和城市是紧密联系的.它们需要彼此
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.	他们被农田围绕 并由一些大的庙宇统领着 例如这一个在乌尔的神殿 事实上,他们是很有效的 精神统领,食物分发中心，两者结合
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.	因为这些神殿组织耕作 收集这些粮食,供奉给诸神 然后把诸神没吃的食物发还给人们
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.	当然，并不是每个都是那么小的城市
But of course not all of them were that small.	比如很著名的罗马城有大约100万居民 在公元一世纪的之前
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."	在我眼里，我把答案称作古老的城市之路
Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.	基本上，罗马有通往海洋的道路 这样使从很远的地方进口食物成为可能
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough.	这样是在古代能实现的唯一的方法 因为陆上运输相当困难 鉴于路况不好
And the food obviously went off very quickly.	而且食物的消耗是很快的
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves.	所以罗马常常发动战争 攻打像迦太基和埃及那样的国家 仅仅是为了得到他们的粮食储备
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really.	其实，事实上，你可以把帝国的扩张 理解为一种长期的 军事化的购物狂欢
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage.	事实上，我喜欢这个事实。
I think that's extraordinary.	我不得不指出的是 罗马（从英国进口牡蛎） 在一个时期。我认为这非常特别
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite.	所以罗马形成自己的海岸线 根据他的口味
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world.	但是还有一件有趣的事情 发生在前工业化的世界
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map.	如果我们看看十七世纪伦敦的地图 我们可以看见作物从泰晤士河畔出产的 位于地图的底部
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.	因为市场在城市的南部
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.	道路从那里 通向主要消费市场戚普塞街 这里也是粮食的主要消费市场
And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago.	如果我们随便看看这里的一条街道的名字 BREAD街，你可以明白 三百年前这里都发生了什么
And the same of course was true for fish.	这个道理同样使用于鱼类
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.	鱼当然是从河里面打捞出来的
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.	Billlingsgate是伦敦有名的卖鱼市场 在1980年之前
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.	这是很特别的，真的，当你仔细想想
Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city.	肉是一个非常不同的故事了 因为，动物自己走向城市
So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales.	因此，伦敦消费的大量肉类 是从西北方过来的 从苏格兰和威尔士
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there.	当他们过来，抵达城市的西北方 这就说明了为什么 Smithfield 伦敦一个非常有名的肉类市场，在这里产生
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.	家禽从Anglia的东部来，去往东北部
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway, and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.	我感觉这有点像一个天气播报员 然后鸟儿都飞过来了 它们的脚被小帆布鞋包裹着
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold, which is why it's called Poultry.	然后当它们在东部降落的时候 具体说来是在戚普塞街，也就是它们被卖掉的地方 这也就是戚普塞街被称为家禽街的原因
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it.	事实上，如果你看看任何一个城市的地图 在工业化时代之前 你能够发现食物是如何进入城市的
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.	事实上，你可以看出食物是如何塑造一个城市的 通过阅读街道的名称，你就会发现很多线索
Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.	星期五街，在过去的日子中 是一个在星期五买鱼的地方
But also you have to imagine it full of food.	但是，你同时也必须想象那里到处都是食物
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.	因为街道和公共区域 是食物买卖的唯一地点
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from.	如果你想象一下1830年的Smithfield 你会发现很难在这样一个城市里面生活下去 并且不留意食物的来源
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier.	事实上，当你在星期日吃午饭的时候 你将很有可能听到窗外的牛羊的叫声 在三年以前
So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle.	因此，显然他是一个有机城市 属于有机循环中的一个部分
And then 10 years later everything changed.	但是，10年后，一切都改变了
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.	这是大西铁路在1840的照片
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep.	你可以看见，一些早期的铁路乘客们 是猪和羊群
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.	一夕之间，这些动物不再走进市场
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside.	他们被屠宰了 在乡村的某个地方
And they're coming into the city by rail.	然后他们通过铁路来到了城市
And this changes everything.	这些改变了一切
To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place.	首先，他第一次 使城市成长变成了可能 不论地点、成为什么规模和形状的城市
Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.	城市发展过去受到地理的限制 城市需要通过很艰难的方式获得食物
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.	突然，他们从地理限制中解放了出来
And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people.	你可以看看伦敦的地图 在铁路建成后的90年 它从容易喂饱的一小点 通过动物步行到市场等方式 成长成为大型的奢侈的大都市 步行运输再也不能喂饱每个人 不论是对人还是对动物
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process.	当然，这仅仅是开始。当汽车代替了火车 这真正标志这个过程的结束
It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.	这是城市的最终解放 从自然的束缚中完全的解放了
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people, because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.	这样类型的城市没有了原来城市的味道 乱糟糟的市容，当然也缺少了人 因为没有人想要在这么大的一块地方步行
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it.	事实上，他们都开小汽车去购买食物了 开车去郊外的超级市场 买回来一周需要的食物 然后考虑到底如何规划这些食品
And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.	这时刻， 食物和城市的关系，完全的改变了
Here we have food -- that used to be the center, the social core of the city -- at the periphery.	过去买食物是在市中心 在城市的最核心地带
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.	买卖食物曾经是一种社会性的活动，
Now it's anonymous.	现在都是匿名了的
We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.	我们原来还需要烹饪，现在我们只需要加水 或者是一些鸡蛋，当我们在做蛋糕或者其他东西的时候
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.	我们不会在去闻闻食物来确认它是否可以吃了
We just read the back of a label on a packet.	我们只是阅读包装袋上的使用说明就好
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.	从体会它的价值变成浪费
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder.	当今食品工业最最讽刺的是 他们让生活极致地便利 却也使得一切更为复杂
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature.	因为可以自由的建立新城市 但是他们却疏远了人可贵的联系 也就是人与自然的联系
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.	同时，他们也让我们依赖这个系统 这个系统，在我们看来，是不可持续的
So what are we going to do about that?	所以，我们应该做点什么呢？
It's not a new question.	这不是一个新的问题
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.	500年前，汤马斯摩尔曾经问过自己
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."	这是他的书《乌托邦》的主旨
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on.	它是一个半独立的城邦 如果这么说听上去还比较熟悉的话 一天的行走你会看见所有人农场都在疯狂的种植 或者在自己的后院种植蔬菜 然后一起享用乡镇的共有食物，等等
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, even though More never framed it that way.	我认为你可能想要说 食物是乌托邦维持秩序的基础 尽管摩尔从来没有这么构想
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."	这里有一个很著名的乌托邦蓝图 来自埃比尼泽·霍华德的花园城市
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states, little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway.	同样的想法。一系列半独立的城邦 小型都市被可耕地包围 相互之间通过铁路连接
And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision.	当然，食物在一次被称作 维持秩序的物体，在他的版本中
It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had.	这些田园都市是有的，但与当初 霍华的愿景没有关系
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.	这也与乌托邦的构想产生了冲突 因为他们是乌托邦
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.	乌托邦实际是上一个托马斯摩尔故意使用的一个词
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.	这似乎是一个笑话。因为它在希腊中有两个来历
It can either mean a good place, or no place.	他既可以表示一个好的地方，也可以表示一个不存在的地方
Because it's an ideal.	因为他是一种理想。
It's an imaginary thing.	一个想象中的事物。
We can't have it.	我们不能拥有它
And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use.	我认为，这是一个观念 用来深层次的思考人类居住的问题 它不是很有用
So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, "sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.	所以我提出另一个概念 希托邦，在古希腊文中 希托代表食物，邦是地方
I believe we already live in Sitopia.	我相信我们已经住在希托邦里面
We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.	这个世界是受食物影响的 只要认清楚这个事实，食物便能成为有力的工具 一个概念性的工具，设计工具，用来改变这个世界
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?	如果这样做，希托邦会成什么样
Well I think it looks a bit like this.	我是这样想的
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.	我用投影这张照片，是因为这狗长相可爱
But anyway, this is -- it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it.	无论如何，在这里 食物是生活的重心 是家庭生活的重心，被赞颂 被享用，你们花时间在这上面
This is where food should be in our society.	这是食物在我们社会里应有的地位
It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them.	这些人是会想到食物的 他们会预先思考，做计划 看到一堆生菜时 知道那是什么
We need these people.	我们需要这种人。
We're part of a network.	我们都是整体的一部分
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.	但是整体联络，食物是当地生产的
It's common. It's fresh.	他是大面积的，也是新鲜的
It's part of the social life of the city.	这是城市社会生活的一部分
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole.	因为没有它，你就不会拥有这样的地方 种植食物的地方也是风景的一部分 他不仅仅是一个消费商品 来自看不见的黑暗角落
Cows with a view.	成片的牛群
Steaming piles of humus.	冒着水汽的肥沃土壤
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.	这才使一切变得完整
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto.	这是一个集体的计划 我最近去了多伦多
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.	在这个温室里，孩子学习 关于食物的知识，以及他们种植自己所需的食物
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin.	这有一颗菜叫做凯文，他也许 属于一个叫凯文的小孩子。
I don't know.	我不太确定
But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.	但是不管怎么说，这类计划 是及其重要的，因为他们试图重新建立我们和自然的联系
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.	因此，希托邦，是另一种观点
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.	如果我们这样做了，城市将不再是 一个不从事生产的大都市，像现在一样
We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected.	我们将把城市 作为一个有机生产的一部分 在这种架构下，城乡之间 以一种共生的方式连接
But of course, that's not a great image either, because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.	但这也不是什么大理论 因为我们不需要这样的食物产出方式了
We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.	我们需要更多的思考关于社区生态农业 所以这张图 很合适来做一个结论
It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.	我们需要重新思考 食物如何塑造我们的生活
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.	我知道的最好的方式是这张650年前的画
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."	他是 Ambrogio Lorenzetti 提出的优秀政府的寓言
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.	他勾画出城市和乡村的关系

Do you remember when we used to go up to Kiteflyer's Hill? Those summer nights, so still with all of the city beneath us and all of our lives ahead before cruel and foolish words were cruelly and foolishly said Some nights I think of you and then I go up on Kiteflyer's Hill wrapped up against the winter chill And somewhere in the city beneath me you lie asleep in your bed and I wonder if ever just briefly do I creep in your dreams now and then Where are you now?	你是否记得我们 一起攀登风筝山的时光 那些夏日夜晚，多么寂静 城市在我们脚下 生命在我们眼前 在残酷和愚蠢的话 残酷愚蠢地脱口而出之前 有些夜晚我会想起你 我会登上 风筝山之巅 在冬日寒风中拥裹着自己 在我脚下城市的某个角落 你正安睡 我不知道哪怕是短短的瞬间 我是否偶尔在你的梦中出现 此刻你在哪里？

Thank you very much.	非常感谢。
I was asked by Wilsonart International, a plastic laminate company, which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, in 2000.	我曾被一个叫做Wilsonart International的 塑料样板房公司 一个全世界最大的塑料样板房公司， 他们找我去设计 贸易展览会的展台 来参展2000年在纽约举行的 2000年在纽约举行.
So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look.	看他们三大市场 他们的产品,基本上是 为交通设计 家具和内饰, 我们想出一个解决方案 一部老式蒸汽机房车然后改造它, 并试图描绘成样板房, 房车,是一个 新生的,当代的产物.
When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.	当房车在我店露面 在伯克利,事实上我从不愿停止设计 无论是蒸汽房车还是其他房车.
So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.	从那时起我可以一个人 便更客观的审视这个新生产物 看看 是否可以完善它.
I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream.	于是，我决定去做一些研究 找出真正的问题在什么地方 探索着蒸汽房车的发展史.
What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces.	在探索中发觉 与外界的实践有些脱节 然而室内实际的边角设计.
In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight, modern, futuristic, high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and the interiors were completely out of sync with that.	外形是最初的构思 未来我们的理念将会是简约时尚, 高科技迅猛发展的时代. 这内外截然不同的设计风格.
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin.	似乎是他们 借鉴了山中小茅屋.
That seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.	这看起来真像是在考验我. 然而他们却不能够 进一步描述 对于一些喜欢逃避现实 又喜欢旅游的人. 居住在房车里,再理想不过了.
We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.	我们真的需要去做一些研究 在房车里.去找出什么是你真正想要的 蒸汽式房车, 这才是我真正的目的和用途.
We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell.	我们除去了所有的乙烯. 使用zolatone油漆 这仅仅是幻想中的铝外壳.
We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.	我们修剪了所有的金属边缘 这看起来像是一座郊区小茅屋.
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard, we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in.	我全心投入到房车墙面的手绘中, 像是在纸板上作画, 我们一直在商讨,哪些地方出了问题, 把它们纠正,改进.
The main goal was to smooth out the interior, and begin to speak about motion, and mobility, and independence.	其主要目的是:完成室内设计, 之后我们便征集议案, 可移动性和独立性.
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer.	对这些房车来说这是最大的困难 问题是当你设计时 没有逻辑的地方停止使用材料, 由于房车的窗体整体性.
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.	还没有连接两个墙壁和天花板的东西 可以粘合在一起,可以改变材料和形状.
So that became a challenge.	因此,成为了一个挑战.
Compounding that, the material of choice, laminate, that I was trying to highlight, only bends in two dimensions.	粘合, 材料上我们选择薄板, 当时我试着突出这种材料 仅弯曲成两种规格.
It's a compound curve interior.	一个是复合的室内曲线设计.
What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell.	这就是我不得不制定 一种欺骗眼球的方法 来相信这些的面板有着 像贝壳一样的曲线.
What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell.	这是提供来的 是一系列第二层外观, 外壳基本上是铝做的
And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space.	然后我试着去做的是 在空间里引导你的眼睛, 这样你会看到不同的几何图形. 并且不会打破空间的协调性.
They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin, so they function as an electrical chase.	他们也了我们一个使用电力的方法 把电线埋在薄板里边. 他们对电的使用.
That's the trailer, pretty much finished.	这样我们就几乎完成了该房车.
That trailer led to another commission, to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.	由于这房车让我们有幸参加另一个委员会, 一个叫做东京设计师的晚会.
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.	这个家具设计在东京的十月持续一周.
Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee, he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.	Teruo Kurosaki, 他拥有着一个叫做Idee的公司 他拜托我运送两辆房车到东京来.
He said one he would like to make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.	他说他想 制作一个真正的,使用性高的房车,并卖出去.
Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.	这两辆房车,就像你有一张白纸,你可以做任何你想做的.
We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States, that would collect records and go on tours.	我们提出一个DJ环游美国的 充满幻想的方案. 这将边收集记录,边旅行.
This trailer housed two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.	房车里将内置两台唱盘机, 混音器、酒吧、冰箱、综合音响系统.
It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people, and basically we'd had a great time with this.	它还有个巨大的沙发，可以坐下几个人. 我们度过了一段非常美好的时光.
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel, and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.	当我看到这房车,连我也想有去旅行,去逃离的冲动. 这是种别具一格的感觉.
A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream.	将很多的想法移植到 蒸汽房车的生产中.
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.	这段时间我开始请教气流。
They came to me and said, "Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?	他们对我说： 好，我们能做些什么把它变的更有新鲜感？
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers, rock climbers, would use these things?"	你认为孩子们，他们知道滑板，冲浪者， 攀岩登山者，会使用这些东西？
And I said, "Well, not in that interior."	我说：嗯，这些运动并不在室内.
Anyway, I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype, and it's called the Bambi prototype.	无论如何.我处理这个 模型时我们修改过6次. 它被叫做小鹿斑比原型.
I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great, big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding."	我想, 最终完成了, 在这个伟大公司里,我会跟重要人物一起工作 致力于工具和模具.
And I walked in their prototype facility, and it's exactly like my shop, only bigger -- same tools, same things.	然而我参观他们的模型设施, 这太像我的店铺了,只是更大一些, 一样的工具, 一样的东西.
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding.	事实上.他们让我走入了困境, 使用我们现有的技术进行内部设计, 而且没有免费的工具和模型.
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.	房车实际上是我们自己动手打造.
All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely, so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers, you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.	所有的部分是独创.独特的, 所以你不能复制出100件一样的房车, 你要为他们量身定做.
They didn't want to go to a componentized system.	他们不是千篇一律.
And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.	然而,这就是小鹿斑比16号.
I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist, so I put children to sleep for a living.	我是一名儿科医生和麻醉师， 我以帮孩子们入睡为生。
And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.	我也是一名大学教师，所以我免费让听我讲课的人打瞌睡。
But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.	但我主要从事的 还是提供管理疼痛的服务 在帕罗奥多市 斯坦福大学的 帕卡德儿童医院。
And it's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning, that pain is a disease.	从经验上来讲， 根据我20或25年的执业经验 今早，我想告诉你的是， 疼痛是一种病。
Now most of the time, you think of pain as a symptom of a disease, and that's true most of the time.	大多数时候， 你会认为疼痛是一种症状。 大多数情况下，这种想法是正确的。
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation.	它的确是肿瘤和感染的症状 或者是发炎、手术中的症状。
But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists.	但有约10％的情况下， 病人虽然已经从上述情况下康复， 但疼痛依然继续。
It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease.	有时候持续几个月 甚至持续几年。 当这种情况发生时， 疼痛本身就是一种疾病。
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it, I want to show you how it feels for my patients.	在我向你讲解它是如何发生 我们可以采取何种措施之前， 我想向你展示一下，病人对此的感受。
So imagine, if you will, that I'm stroking your arm with this feather, as I'm stroking my arm right now.	如果可以，请你想象一下， 我用这根羽毛挠你， 就像现在我挠自己的手臂一样。
Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this.	现在，我要你想象 如果我是用这个挠你呢？
Please keep your seat.	请大家只管坐好！
A very different feeling.	非常迥异的感觉。
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?	这跟慢性疼痛有什么关联呢？
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.	如果这两个感觉被混淆了
Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather, but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.	想象一下你的生活将会怎样 如果我是用这根羽毛去挠你， 结果你的大脑却告诉你 你现在的感觉是灼伤-- 这就是我的患者对慢性疼痛的感受。
In fact, imagine something even worse.	事实上，想象下更糟糕的情况。
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather, and their brain [was] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch.	想象下我用这根羽毛去挠你孩子的胳膊， 结果他们的大脑却告诉他们 他们感受到的是这个灼热的喷火枪。
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler, whom you see in the photograph.	这就是我的患者，钱德勒的遭遇， 就是照片中的女孩。
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.	正如你看到的，她是个漂亮的年轻姑娘。
She was 16 years old last year when I met her, and she aspired to be a professional dancer.	去年当我遇到她时，她16岁， 她渴望成为一名专业的舞者。
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.	在她的一次舞蹈排练中， 她摔倒压在了自己向外伸展的手臂上，并且扭伤了手腕。
Now you would probably imagine, as she did, that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life.	就像当时钱德勒的想法， 你可能也认为这就是人生当中 一次普通的受伤。
Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story.	用绷带缠起来 吃点布洛芬，一周或两周 事情就会结束。
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.	但是在钱德勒这次的遭遇中，这只是故事的开始。
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.	摸上去像尸体一样冷
The muscles were frozen, paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that.	肌肉僵硬-- 我们通常所说的瘫痪性肌张力异常。
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands, to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow, almost all the way to her shoulder.	疼痛从她的手腕蔓延到手掌， 到手指，又从手腕蔓延到手肘， 一直到她的肩膀。
But the worst part was, not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.	但最糟糕的 不是每天24小时的自发性疼痛。
The worst part was that she had allodynia, the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch.	最糟糕的是她患上痛觉超敏症 这是一个医学术语 说的就是我刚才用羽毛和喷火枪所演示的那种情况
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand, the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on -- caused excruciating, burning pain.	轻微的触碰她的手臂 触碰手掌， 即使是她自己穿衣服时触碰到手袖、衣物 也会造成难以忍受的烧灼痛
How can the nervous system get this so wrong?	神经系统怎么会犯这样的错呢？
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame?	神经系统 怎么会误解一个本来无害的触觉呢？ 就像是把手的触摸 误解成 触摸火焰的恶意感觉。
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house.	把身体里的神经系统 想象成你家里的电线电路。
In your house, wires run in the wall, from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb.	在你家里，电线布满在墙壁里， 从灯的开关到天花板上的接线盒 从接线盒又到灯泡。
And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.	当你打开开关的时候，灯泡亮了
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.	等你关闭开关的时候，灯泡熄灭。
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.	假设神经系统就是这样。
If you hit your thumb with a hammer, these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires, new nerves, take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.	如果你用锤子敲大拇指， 你手臂里的电线——当然，我们称为神经—— 在脊髓里传递信息到接线盒 新电线，新的神经 把信息运送到大脑 因此你能自觉意识到你的大拇指受伤了。
But the situation, of course, in the human body is far more complicated than that.	这个情况，当然，是发生在身体里的 实际上更复杂一些。
Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion, in fact, what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells.	相反 脊髓里的接线盒 仅仅是一段神经联系另一段神经的地方 通过释放这些小棕色块 也就是被称为神经递质的化学信息 以一对一的线性方式 事实上 是神经递质发散出三维空间-- 在脊髓里横向、纵向、以及上下地-- 它们和其他邻近的细胞之间 开始发生反应。
These cells, called glial cells, were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together, like the nerves.	这些细胞，称为神经胶质细胞， 它们曾经被认为 是脊髓里不重要的结构构件 仅仅是把其他重要的东西连接在一起， 比如说神经。
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences.	结果却发现 在疼痛的案例中，神经胶质细胞 在调节，扩大 和歪曲 感觉体验的作用中起着非常重要的作用。
These glial cells become activated.	这些胶质细胞活跃起来。
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins, which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves, and they start releasing their neurotransmitters, and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth, until what we have is a positive feedback loop.	它们的脱氧核糖核酸开始合成新的蛋白质 同时发散出来 与邻近的神经发生反应。 释放出神经递质。 神经递质又被发散出来 激活了邻近的胶质细胞，然后如此循环往复， 直到 神经反射。
It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch, the toilet flushed three doors down, or your dishwasher went on, or your computer monitor turned off.	几乎就像是有人到你家 重新在你墙壁里布线， 结果你下次打开灯的开关， 却意外的冲了三次马桶， 或者是启动了洗碗机， 或者是电脑显示器被关闭。
That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain.	乱套了！ 但事实上， 这就是患上慢性疼痛后，会发生的事情。
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.	也是为什么疼痛本身会变成一种疾病。
The nervous system has plasticity.	神经系统有可塑性。
It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli.	对刺激做出反应 它会改变，也会变异。
Well, what do we do about that?	那我们该怎么办呢？
What can we do in a case like Chandler's?	针对钱德勒这样的情况我们该怎么做呢？
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time.	我们用相对粗糙的一种方式来治疗这些患者 目前是这样的。
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are, frankly, not very effective for this kind of pain.	我们用控制症状的药物来治疗 也就是止疼药 坦白说，对于这种病 不是很有效。
We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet, and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.	我们只是让那些吵闹的神经 消停下来， 用局部麻醉来使它们进入睡眠。
And most importantly, what we do is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life.	最重要的是，我们所做的 只是用枯燥且常不舒服的 物理治疗和职业治疗法 来在神经系统里维持神经 使它们在日常生活的 感官活动中 做出正常的反应。
And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency, despair and depression that always accompanies severe, chronic pain.	对此，我们用密集的心理治疗方案 进行全力的配合 解决那些 伴随严重慢性疼痛而来的 沮丧、绝望和抑郁。
It's successful, as you can see from this video of Chandler, who, two months after we first met her, is now doings a back flip.	我们很成功！ 正如你从这个视频短片中看到的钱德勒， 在我们遇见她两个月之后， 她正做着后空翻。
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here, and she's doing absolutely fantastic.	昨天我刚和她一起吃了午饭， 因为现在，她是在长滩学习舞蹈的一名大学生。 她现在简直是棒极了！
The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem, as we have now, but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells, or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate, that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up, or plasticity, that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain.	 而是，正如我们现在看到的， 去开发那种治病的药物 能真正从根本上解决问题 对付神经胶质细胞 或对付那些由神经胶质细胞产生的 有害的蛋白质 它们溢出后使中枢神经系统产生发条拧紧现象， 产生神经的可塑性， 因此就有可能 歪曲和扩大了 我们称为疼痛的感觉体验。
So I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized, who said, "My philosophy: No pain, no pain."	所以，我有一个愿望 在将来 乔治·卡林的预言会实现， 他说，我的哲学是： 没痛就不痛。
Thank you very much.	非常感谢
Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep, so dark, so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.	今天，我将带你们启程前往 一个很深、 很黑暗、未被探索过的地方， 我们对它的了解比我们对月球背面的了解还要少。
It's a place of myth and legend.	这是一个充满神秘与传奇之地。
It's a place marked on ancient maps as "here be monsters."	在古代地图上，它被标识为 怪物出没的地方。
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.	这个地方，每个新的探索之旅 都带回了有关惊人的神奇生物的新发现， 我们的祖先认为这些生物是怪物。
Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.	实际上，我十分羡慕 我世界自然保护联盟的同事们 能够去马达加斯加海岭的南部继续此次旅程， 去拍摄真实的图片， 去观察这些海洋深处的神奇生物。
We are talking about the high seas.	我们谈论的是公海。
The "high seas" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.	公海是一个法律概念。 但实际上，它覆盖了地球的50%。
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth.	海洋的平均深度 是4000米。 实际上，公海为地球上的生命 提供了近90%的 栖息地。
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.	理论上，它是全球共有的， 属于我们大家。
But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it.	但是，事实上 它被某些 有资源走入并勘探深海的人 管理和利用着。
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark.	因而，今天我要带你们展开旅程， 破除一些过时的 阻止我们成为 在黑暗的公海的真正的利益相关者的 神话、传奇与猜想。
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care.	我们将航向一些特定的地点， 在过去数年我们在这些地方有所发现， 这些发现表明为何我们确实需要关注公海。
And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect.	最后，我们将试着 发展和提出一个新的 有关公海治理的观点。 这一观点植根于整个海洋的保护， 在国际准则框架内 进行预警和关注。
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue.	好，这是一幅公海图片， 正如之前所看到的 -- 是用深蓝色表示的区域。
To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent.	对于我，一名国际律师， 这更加让我害怕， 比起任何我们可能见过的生物或怪物更令人害怕， 因为它说明我们能切实保护海洋， 全球海洋 提供给我们所有人需要的 碳、热量、氧气， 如果你仅能保护其中的36%的话。
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.	这是真正的地球之心。
Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore.	我们不得不面对的一些问题 是现有的国际法—— 例如，航海方面—— 提供了更多保护 给那些近岸区域。
For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore.	例如，垃圾排放， 你可能认为仅仅是简单地排放掉， 但是法律关于 船舶垃圾排放的规定 实际上离岸上越远就越软弱。
As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas.	因此，我们垃圾排放场所的 面积相当于德克萨斯的两倍。
It's unbelievable.	这令人难以置信。
We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case.	我们过去认为解决污染的办法 是进行稀释， 但是这已被证明不再适用。
So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all.	因此，我们从社会学家 和经济学家，如埃莉诺.奥斯特洛姆那里学到的是， 他们正在研究 局部地区对共有物的管理现象， 那里有某种先决条件， 你能满足先决条件， 就能为了个人或社会的利益 管理和进入 公共领域。
And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community.	这些包括一种共同的责任感， 共同的理念将人们团结在一起。
Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules.	有条件准入：你可以邀请人们加入， 但他们必须按规则行事。
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules, you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement, for as we've discovered, you can trust, but you also need to verify.	当然，如果你想让人们按规则行事， 仍需要一个有效的系统 来监督和实施， 正如我们所发现的， 你可信任他们，但是也须证明他们可信。
What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas.	我还想传达的是， 厄运和黑暗 并非我们在公海上所见到的全部。
For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you.	对于一群非常乐于奉献的个人—— 科学家、环境保护主义者、 摄影家和国家—— 能够实实在在地改变悲剧轨迹， 这些悲剧轨迹破坏了脆弱的海洋风光。 例如这个珊瑚花园， 你面前所看到的这张，
That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling.	我们能够 从深海底部的拖网捕捞中挽救其命运。
And how did we do that?	我们怎么做的呢？
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process.	如我之前所说，我们有一群摄影家登船出海， 他们拍摄了拖网捕捞活动过程。
But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed.	但是，我们也在在联合国的机构 内花了一些时间， 尝试与政府合作，让他们明白 远离陆地的地方发生了什么 我们过去几乎没有人能想象到的事， 这些生物存在。
So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling.	故在3年内， 从2003到2006年， 我们能够建立一些规范。 这些规范确实改变了过去的模式， 有关渔民从事 深海拖网捕捞的模式，
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want," we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm.	你不再能想去哪就去哪，想干啥就干啥。 我们确实创设了一种制度， 你想到哪里去需要预先评估， 并有责任避免重大损害。
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected.	2009年，当联合国检查我们的进度时， 他们发现， 几乎1亿平方公里的海床 受到了保护。
This does not mean that it's the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection.	这并非意味着问题得到了彻底解决 或者已经提供了永久性保护。
But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime.	但是它确实意味着， 一群个人可以形成一个团体， 来切实塑造 公海时代的治理方式， 创造一种新的制度。
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet.	故我乐观地看待我们的机遇， 来创造一个真正蔚蓝的前景， 为这美丽的星球。
Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.	西尔维娅的愿望 向我们提供了 通往人类心灵的途径。 你可能会说， 这些几乎鼠目寸光的人 现在却越来越有兴趣 关注海龟这样的生物的整个生命周期。 他们真的将大部分时间花在了公海上。
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain.	今天我们只打算航行到 这些特殊地区中的很小一部分， 仅仅是给你一点 有关它们所蕴含的富饶与神奇风情的概念。
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there.	例如马尾藻海， 它不是一个被海岸包围的海洋， 它被洋流环绕， 洋流包裹和环绕着 马尾藻的养分。 马尾藻生长、聚集于此。
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.	它也被认为是鳗鱼产卵之地。 这些鳗鱼来自北欧 和北美的河流。 这些鱼的数量正在减少。 在斯德哥尔摩，它们已经消失了。 最近在英国发现了5条。
But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region.	但是在马尾藻海 以聚集马尾藻的同样方式 聚集了 充满整个区域的塑料。
This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.	这个图片并未确切显示 我所想展示的这些塑料垃圾，因为我自己从未到过那里。
It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs.	它也确实提供了一个特殊的栖息场所， 让这些飞鱼产卵。
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area.	 有部分马尾藻海 在其国内管辖权的范围之内—— 但是，马尾藻海庞大的主体部分超出了其管辖范围—— 百慕大政府正作为一项运动的先锋 来保护这个极重要的地区。
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.	现在我们转向一个比马尾藻海更冷一点的地方， 南太平洋的罗斯海。
It's actually a bay.	它实际是个海湾。
It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims.	它被认为是公海，因为该大陆 已经超出 任何国家宣示领土的限度。
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.	因此，该水域中的一切都被当做公海一样对待。
But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem.	但是罗斯海如此重要 是因为广袤海域由浮冰构成。 浮冰在春季和夏季 提供养分给浮游生物和磷虾。 直到近年它们仍支持着 一个完整的 近海生态系统。
But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region.	但是不幸的是，CAMLAR—— 一个地区的委员会， 它负责保护和管理渔业资源 和其他海洋生物资源， 不幸地开始向捕鱼利益让步 并授权在本地区 扩大对牙鱼的捕捞。
The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food.	一艘新西兰船舶的船长 刚到过那里。 他报告称， 罗斯海虎鲸数量急剧减少。 虎鲸直接依赖南极牙鱼 作为主要食物来源。
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.	因此，我们需要做的是大胆站起来， 分别和共同 向政府施压， 向地区渔业管理组织施压， 宣示我们的权利， 声明公海某些地区捕鱼量的上限。 以此说明捕鱼自由不在意味着 在任何地方、任何时间捕鱼的自由。
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.	换一个更接近这里的地方，哥斯达黎加圆突区 是近年才开发的地区—— 是潜在的蓝鲸的常年栖息地。
There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long.	这里有足够的食物 让他们度过四季。
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.	但是，哥斯达黎加圆突区的不平凡之处 在于它实际不是一个永久性区域。
It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.	这是一个海洋学的现象， 它随时间及季节变动。
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season.	正因为如此，对它进行保护是项挑战。 但是我们也面临着保护随着它而移动的物种的挑战。
As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.	我们能够使用同样的技术， 即渔民识别鱼群所在地的技术， 来接近这一地区。
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round.	 当它极其脆弱的时候 ——在很多情况下，这可能是常年的。
Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.	我们靠近海岸一点， 就会发现这是在加拉帕格斯群岛发生的情况。
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.	很多物种经过这一地区， 因而这里获得很多 有关保护 太平洋东部热带海洋的关注。
This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area.	此倡议是得到 国际保护组织 和各方面以及一些政府的配合， 力图建立一体化的管理制度， 在这一区域。
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative.	它提供了一个你能去哪里的极好范例， 用一个真实的地区性倡议的方式。
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.	它保护着五处世界遗产。
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present.	不幸的是，世界人类遗产公约 没有意识到需要保护的区域 目前超出了国家管辖的范围。
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas.	因此，一个像哥斯达黎加圆突区的地方， 严格来说无法证明 它在公海内的时间。
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.	因此我们建议： 要么我们需要修订世界人类遗产公约， 让它能适应 和推动对这些世界遗产的普遍性保护。 要么我们改变该公约的名称， 称之为半世界人类遗产公约。
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.	但是，我们也知道像这些海龟这样的物种 不会一直处于太平洋东部热带海洋。
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch.	它们有时会进入广阔的南太平洋的涡流中， 在此度过它们的大半生。 并且它们经常最后被这样钩住， 或者被误捕。
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.	因此，我确实要建议我们需要拓展。
We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.	我们需要局部性工作， 但是我们也需要进行海洋全流域的工作。
We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative.	我们现在有一些工具和技术 使我们能提出一个更广泛的 海洋全流域的倡议。
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.	我们听说过标记太平洋捕食动物工程， 这是17个海洋生命普查工程之一。
It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home.	它为我们提供了这样的数据， 小小的灰鹱 以整个海盆为家。
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year.	在不到一年的时间内， 它们飞行65000公里。
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.	因此我们有来自海洋生命普查工程的工具和数据。
And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October.	它的最后一年 将于10月开始。
So stay tuned for further information.	故要继续等待进一步信息。
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found.	振奋人心的发现是 海洋生命普查 不只着眼于标记太平洋的捕食动物， 它同样注意未被探索过的中水层生物， 在这里像这样游动的海参一类的生物 已被发现。
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers.	幸运的是，像国际自然和自然资源保护联合会一样，我们能够 与海洋生命普查工作合作， 而且有很多科学家为之工作， 力图传递 很多这种信息给政策制定者们。
We have the support of governments now behind us.	现在我们有了政府的支持。
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.	我们通过技术工作室发布这种信息。
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots.	令人兴奋地是我们有足够的信息 去进一步保护一些 明显有希望的地区和热点地区。
At the same time we're saying, "Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."	同时，我们号召 是的，我们需要更多，我们需要前进。
But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it?	但是你们中的很多人说过， 如果这些海域能得到保护， 或是一项合理的公海渔业管理制度能够到位。 你将如何去执行它？
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology.	这将我引向除了海洋科学以外，我第二感兴趣的方面， 就是外层空间技术。
I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean.	我曾想成为一名宇航员， 故我一直关注 可从外层空间， 监测地球的技术—— 如我们所知，我们拥有惊人的技术， 跟踪被标记了的物种的科技， 在它们的整个生命周期中， 在海洋里。
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.	我们也能标记和追踪渔船。
Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.	很多船上已经装了异频雷达收发机， 使我们能发现它们在哪里以及在做什么。
But not all the vessels have those to date.	但是迄今为止并非所有船舶都安装上了。
It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing.	这并不需要多少高科技 来创造新的法律。 如果你想拥有特权 获得我们的公海资源， 我们需要知道——有人需要知道—— 你在哪里以及在做什么。
So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.	因此，它将我带回主题 这就是我们能够避免共同的悲剧。
We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas.	我们能阻止这些冲突， 这些冲突发生在占地球50% 的公海上。
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.	但是我们需要广泛思考，我们需要全球性的思考，
We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources.	我们需要改变我们正用于 管理这些资源的方式。
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect.	我们需要获得新的 关于预防和重视的模式。
At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management.	同时，我们需要局部性思考。 西尔维娅的愿望能够获得成功的原因 是我们能够聚焦于一个亮点， 在这些此前未知的地区。
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.	各物种都是海底全流域活动的
Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide.	很多深海群落 有着遗传学分布， 遍及海洋全流域。
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect.	我们需要理解， 但是我们也需要开始管理和保护。
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes.	为了做到这些， 你也需要海盆管理制度。
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization.	我们有地区性管理制度， 在专属经济区。 但是我们需要整合它们，我们需要设立权限， 像在南太平洋那样。 在那里，它们有双管齐下的渔业 和保护组织。
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.	所以在这一点上，我愿意真诚感谢和赞扬 西尔维娅.厄尔的愿望， 它帮助我们面向公海 和超出国家管辖权的深海。
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.	这有助于我们组建一个令人惊叹的团体。 它由极具天赋的人们共同组成， 力图解决和洞察 这些给我们制造障碍的问题， 来管理和理性利用 这曾一度遥远的区域。
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.	因此，这趟旅程，我希望能带给你们 一个有关公海的全新视角， 公海只有一个，它也是我们的家园。 我们需要共同努力， 如果我们要使公海在未来成为可持续的属于所有人的海洋。
Thank you.	谢谢。
I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea.	我要 在接下来的18分钟内 与大家分享一个不可思议的愿景
Actually, it's a really big idea.	一个非常雄伟的愿景
But to get us started, I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world.	不过首先 我想请在座各位 闭上双眼在几秒钟内想一想 某种技术或者科学 在你看来，改变了世界
Now I bet, in this audience, you're thinking of some really incredible technology, some stuff that I haven't even heard of, I'm absolutely sure.	我打赌，这里所有的观众 你一定想到了某种神奇的技术 某种我甚至没听说过的玩意儿 绝对是的
But I'm also sure, pretty sure, that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.	但我同时也确信，非常肯定 绝对没有人想到它
This is a polio vaccine.	这是一支脊髓灰质炎疫苗
And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted.	其实，这很好 今天在座没人想到它 是因为我们已将它视为理所当然
This is a great technology.	这是一项伟大的技术
We can take it completely for granted.	我们可以完全地应用它
But it wasn't always that way.	但是过去并不是这样
Even here in California, if we were to go back just a few years, it was a very different story.	甚至就在这里，加利福尼亚 如果退后几十年 情况可大不相同
People were terrified of this disease.	当时，人们惧怕这种疾病
They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.	他们十分害怕脊髓灰质炎，它能引起公众惊恐
And it was because of scenes like this.	原因就如图中所示
In this scene, people are living in an iron lung.	在这张图片里 人们生活在铁制的肺中
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before, and then two days later, they can no longer breathe, and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs, but also their breathing muscles.	这些人，两三天前还相当健康 可几天后 便丧失呼吸功能 脊髓灰质炎病毒 不仅仅瘫痪了他们的四肢 就连控制呼吸的肌肉也不放过
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually, in this iron lung to breathe for them.	通常，他们的余生都得在 铁肺里度过
This disease was terrifying.	这个疾病十分可怕
There was no cure, and there was no vaccine.	当时却没有疗法 也没有疫苗
The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it.	这个疾病如此恐怖 以至于当时的美国总统 发动了一场声势浩大的全国运动 来试图阻止它的传播
Twenty years later, they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine.	二十年后，他们成功地 开发出脊髓灰质炎疫苗
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s.	这被视为科学奇迹 当时是20世纪50年代末
Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease, and here in the United States it had an incredible impact.	终于，有一种疫苗能够阻止这种可怕的疾病 在美国 它有着惊人的影响力
As you can see, the virus stopped, and it stopped very, very fast.	正如我们所知，病毒被遏制 并且很快被遏制
But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world.	可并不是 全世界都如此
And it happened so fast in the United States, however, that even just last month Jon Stewart said this: Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?	虽然在美国，情况迅速好转，但是 甚至就在上个月，乔恩·斯图尔特问我 乔恩·斯图尔特：脊髓灰质炎还活跃在哪些地方呢？
Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated.	我以为它已经被灭绝 就如天花从地球上消失一样
Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.	布鲁斯·艾尔沃德：哎，乔恩，脊髓灰质炎是几乎被灭绝了
But the reality is that polio still exists today.	但现实是 它仍然存在于世间
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.	我们绘制了疾病分布图，给乔恩展示了目前的状况
This is the picture.	这就是那张图
There's not very much left in the world.	存于世界的病源已经很好了
But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership working behind the scenes, almost unknown, I'm sure to most of you here today.	而这是因为 有一个非常出色的公私合作组织 一直在幕后积极工作 我肯定今天在座几乎都没听说过这个组织
It's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease, and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic.	在过去20年来 这个组织一直试图根除这种疾病 并终于将其影响区域下降到 我们现在看到的状况
But just last year, we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio.	但就在去年 我们被强烈震动 我们似乎总是做得不够 难以应对像脊髓灰质炎这样的病毒
And this is the reason: in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade, on opposite sides of the globe, there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.	原因如下 有两个国家 十多年未出现脊髓灰质炎 它们各位于地球两端 却突然都爆发了严重的脊髓灰质炎
Hundreds of people were paralyzed.	数百人瘫痪
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults.	死亡人数上百-- 儿童和成年人都成了受害者
And in both cases, we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses, and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.	在这两个国家 我们都运用了基因排序的方法来观察查病毒 发现这些病毒并不是来自本土
They had come from thousands of miles away.	他们从几千公里外的地方远道而来
And in one case, it originated on another continent.	其中一个国家的病毒竟来自于另一个大陆
And not only that, but when they came into these countries, then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia, where, for the first time in over a decade last year, children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years.	不仅如此，当他们进入这些国家后 很可能又登上了商务航班 飞到了更远的地方 如俄罗斯 在那里，去年，十多年来第一次 有儿童因脊髓灰质炎而瘫痪 而当地已多年未见这种疾病
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you, these are under control now, and it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.	刚才我展示给你的这些疾病突发区域 情况已经得到控制 并且看起来它们很快将停止
But the message was very clear.	但信息是清晰的
Polio is still a devastating, explosive disease.	脊髓灰质炎仍然是 毁灭性，爆炸性的疾病
It's just happening in another part of the world.	它不过正在世界另外一个角落发生
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis.	我们巨大的愿景是 本时代的科学奇迹 将彻底根除 脊髓灰质炎
So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership, is trying to do.	在这里，我想要介绍一下 之前提到的合作伙伴组织，脊髓灰质炎合作机构 当前的工作
We're not trying to control polio.	我们不是单纯去控制脊髓灰质炎
We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases, because this disease is like a root fire; it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.	将它的发病率降低到极低 因为这种疾病就像是火种 若不完全熄灭，它随时可能爆发
So what we're looking for is a permanent solution.	因此我们寻求的 是一种永久的解决方案
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys, can take for granted a polio-free world.	我们希望在这个世界，每个孩子，都能像在座各位一样 不用再为 脊髓灰质炎而担心
So we're looking for a permanent solution, and this is where we get lucky.	是的，我们在寻找一种永久的解决方案 幸运的是
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.	脊髓灰质炎属于这样一种少见的病毒类 其本身带有一定缺陷 让人类可以攻克，并取得伟大成就
This virus can only survive in people.	脊髓灰质炎病毒只能在人体中存活
It can't live for a very long time in people.	并且存活时间很短
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.	它在自然界中几乎无法生存
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.	我们有很有效的疫苗，我刚才已展示给各位
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely.	此我们正努力 彻底根除这种病毒
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth.	脊髓灰质炎根除项目正试图 根除这种病毒本身 来防止导致脊髓灰质炎 在地球上肆意蔓延
Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this, to eradicating diseases.	我们并不擅长 根除疾病 这样的任务
It's been tried six times in the last century, and it's been successful exactly once.	上个世纪我们尝试了六次 但只有一次真正成功
And this is because disease eradication, it's still the venture capital of public health.	因为疾病根除 仍是公众健康的风险资金
The risks are massive, but the pay-off -- economic, humanitarian, motivational -- it's absolutely huge.	风险是巨大的 但回报 无论从经济，全人类，还是推动力来看 也都是巨大的
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs.	美国一位国会议员认为 美国投入的 用以根除天花的全部投资 每26天就能收回一次成本 通过抵消治疗成本 和疫苗的成本
And if we can finish polio eradication, the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone.	如果我们能够完全根除小儿麻痹症 世界上最穷的那些国家 则将节省500亿美元 时间是仅在未来的25年内
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.	这就是我们追求的利益
But smallpox eradication was hard; it was very, very hard.	但是根除天花的过程是很困难的 相当，相当艰难
And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher, and there's a few reasons for that.	而要根除小儿麻痹症，从很多方面来讲，还要难 这里有几个因素
The first is that, when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago, more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox.	首先 我们开始尝试根除脊髓灰质炎时 时间大概是20年前 当时，被其感染的国家数量 是开始根除天花之际的两倍多
And there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries.	而感染脊髓灰质炎国家的人口数 超过感染天花的10倍
So it was a massive effort.	因此当时的努力是艰巨的
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine, which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.	我们面临的第二个挑战是-- 脊髓灰质炎疫苗与天花疫苗性质不同 天花疫苗性质稳定，打一次就终身免疫 而脊髓灰质炎疫苗是否脆弱
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat, and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.	在赤道地区，它很快变质 我们必须将特殊的疫苗检测器 安在每支疫苗上 因此它能迅速做出反应 当疫苗因为受热过多而改变性质时 我们便知道它不再适用于儿童 因为效力不够，无法保护儿童
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.	即便这样，儿童仍然需要多次注射疫苗
But the third challenge we have -- and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge -- is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy -- every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash.	我们当时面临的第三个挑战 很可能是最大的一个挑战 与天花作战时，我们总能看清敌人 几乎每个感染天花的人 都会长出明显的疹子
So you could get around the disease; you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.	因此我们可以从疾病周边入手 给疾病存在的周边区域打疫苗,将其断绝
With polio it's almost completely different.	而脊髓灰质炎则全然不同
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease.	绝大多数被病毒感染的人 不会表现出任何迹象
So you can't see the enemy most of the time, and as a result, we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox.	因此很多时候我们根本看不见敌人 因此 我们需要一种与应对天花非常不同的方式 来根除脊髓灰质炎
We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history.	我们不得不创造出 历史上最大的社会运动之一
There's over 10 million people, probably 20 million people, largely volunteers, who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.	投入人数超过一千万 甚至接近两千万 大多为志愿者 他们过去二十年来一直努力 贡献于现在被称为 和平年代最大的国际协同运作
These people, these 20 million people, vaccinate over 500 million children every single year, multiple times at the peak of our operation.	这些人，这两千万人 给五亿多的儿童注射疫苗 每年如此 在运作繁忙的时候 注射数量增倍
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.	注射脊髓灰质炎疫苗很简单
It's just two drops, like that.	就是这样简单的两针
But reaching 500 million people is much, much tougher.	但要普及五亿多人 那可是难上加难
And these vaccinators, these volunteers, they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest, densest urban slums in the world.	这些疫苗注射者，这些志愿者们 必须投身到 一些环境最恶劣的 城市贫民窟中
They've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.	必须在炎阳下跋涉 到一些最遥远，最难以到达的地方
And they also have to dodge bullets, because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children, even in areas affected by conflict.	有时他们也要躲避战火 因为我们必须要运作 即使在不稳定的停火和休战条约下 也要给孩子注射疫苗 在卷入冲突的地区也如此

They're right at the center of the whole thing.	他们是整个运动的正中心
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years, much longer than it should have -- but once it was built, the results were striking.	我们花了很多时间来发展基础建设 为的是根除脊髓灰质炎 超过十五年，比我们预计要长 但一旦建成，效果是显著的
Within a couple of years, every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses, with the exception of four countries that you see here.	几年之类 那些开始进行脊髓灰质炎根除的国家 迅速地消灭了现有的三种脊髓灰质炎病毒 唯一例外是图表上的这四个国家
And in each of those, it was only part of the country.	而在这几个国家中，疾病都只存在于一小部分区域
And then, by 1999, one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept.	1999年 我们试图根除的 三种脊髓灰质炎病毒其中之一 被完全地在全世界消灭 证明了这是有效的方式
And then today, there's been a 99 percent reduction -- greater than 99 percent reduction -- in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease.	今天 有百分之九十九 超过百分之九十九的 儿童 免于因这恐怖疾病而瘫痪
When we started, over 20 years ago, 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus.	而在二十多年前我们开始之际 一千名儿童因它瘫痪 这是每一天的数据

The first problem we ran into was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus, we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.	我们遇到的第一个问题是 在最后的四个国家，这种病毒的根据地 我们似乎无法将它根除
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades.	更糟糕的是 病毒开始在这四个国家以外的地区传播 特别是在印度北部和尼日尼亚北部 它深入到非洲亚洲多数地区，甚至是欧洲 导致了极大的爆发 而这些地方已经几十年没有出现过这种疾病
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have.	然后 在最重要，最顽固的 脊髓灰质炎病毒感染区 我们发现我们的疫苗 效力减半
In conditions like this, the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to.	在这种情况下 疫苗无法满足要求的时间 进入孩子的胃中 按他们需要的方式来保护他们
Now at that time, there was a great, as you can imagine, frustration -- let's call it frustration -- it started to grow very, very quickly.	在那时 我们感到一种巨大的，你能够想象的 沮丧，我们暂且称之为沮丧吧 它开始迅速蔓延
And all of a sudden, some very important voices in the world of public health started to say, "Hang on.	突然，一些世界公众医疗领域 很重要的声音 开始说，等等
We should abandon this idea of eradication.	我们应该放弃根除的目标
The brutal truth is, if we don't have the will or the skill, or even the money that we need to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world, with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine, then pretty soon, more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year.	残酷的现实是 如果我们没有愿望或技能 或者所需的资金 来帮助儿童，那些世界上最脆弱的儿童 哪怕方法是通过简单的 口头脊髓灰质炎疫苗 那么很快 超过二十万的儿童 将再一次因脊髓灰质炎而瘫痪 每年如此

But as we tried these extraordinary things, as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics, we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine, so that when they finally get to these kids, we can have a better bang for our buck.	在我们尝试这些独特的方式 当人们费劲心思 重新制定战略的同时 我们再度回到疫苗本身，这疫苗已有50年历史 我们确信，我们能够研制出更好的疫苗 因此当儿童最终接收到疫苗时 我们会取得更好的预防效果

It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.	这数目听起来很大，的确，是花了很多钱

We have a big gap in that money.	我们差的还很远。
We're cutting corners, and every time we cut corners, more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.	因此我们在减少开支 但每减少一次 就意味着更多本不该被感染的地区受到感染，同时减缓我们的进度
And that great buy costs us a little bit more.	而这项伟大交易的成本又上涨了一些

I grew up in New York City, between Harlem and the Bronx.	我在纽约市长大， 介于哈莱姆区和布朗克斯区之间。
Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating -- no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects.	从小男孩起，我们学到 男人应该意志坚强，身体强壮， 有勇气，有支配权-- 没有痛苦，没有感情， 除了愤怒之外-- 男人什么都不怕-- 男人全权负责，主管一切， 而女人不是； 男人是领导， 女人应该只是跟随和做男性吩咐的事； 男人带有优越性，女人是低人一等； 男人是强大的，女人弱小； 女人价值比较小-- 仅是男人的财富 和物品， 特别是性猎物。
I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the "man box."	我后来了解到 这如上都是男人的集体社会化属性， 更好地称为 男人束缚体。
See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man.	看看这男人束缚体 所有的成分 这就是我们怎样定义一个男人的。
Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man.	此时我想说，毫无疑问， 男人身上也有很多美好的，不可思议的， 绝对棒的 品质。
But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood.	但同时， 有些东西 完全是扭曲了 我们真的需要开始 挑战，看看这些男性的特征 我们要进行 解构，重新定义， 我们重新认识什么才是男人气概。
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.	这是我家的两个孩子，肯德尔和杰伊。

And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying.	当他们大约五岁和六岁， 或者四岁和五岁时， 杰伊可以来向我 哭哭啼啼。
It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out.	当她哭泣，这没什么问题， 她可以坐在我膝上，她的鼻涕流到我的袖子上， 尽管哭，哭出来。
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.	有爸爸在你身边爱护你是很重要的。
Now Kendall on the other hand -- and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her -- he'd come to me crying, it's like as soon as I would hear him cry, a clock would go off.	但换成是肯德尔-- 我说过，他比杰伊仅大15个月-- 他向我哭泣， 只要我听到他哭， 我的心理闹钟就上了发条
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds, which means, by the time he got to me, I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?	我会给肯德尔约30秒时间， 意味着，此时他得面对我， 我会说这样的话，你为什么哭？

I can't understand you.	我实在不懂你。

And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, "Just go in your room.	我对没有 尽到自己的责任担当起 把他培养成男人的角色而感动沮丧 我还要适应这些原则 和这些男人束缚体的条条框框， 我觉得我会说出以下的话， 回到你房间去。
Just go on, go on in your room.	快回到你房间，

And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground -- something I just can't even imagine.	我父亲，做为男人， 10分钟前， 刚刚下葬了他的孩子 入土-- 我真不敢想象当时发生的事。
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying.	最让我触动的事 是他向我道歉 在我面前的哭泣。 同时，他也安慰我， 让我振作起来， 不要哭。

No, the boy said to me -- the boy said to me, "It would destroy me."	不，男孩对我 说到： 这会毁了我。
And I said to myself, "God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?"	我又对自己说： 上帝啊，如果这句话会毁了一个男孩 当他被嘲笑为像个女孩时， 那么关于女孩的事，我们会教给 他点什么呢？

So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.	但当时我的确搞不清楚我要做什么， 我试图想从这间屋出去。

And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness, and yet he has different experiences, in many cases a different vocabulary, a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders.	这提醒我 我们需要这样运行一支军队 他们必须分享目的 分享意识 然而他有不同的经验 在很多例子中 这是不同的词汇 完全不同的一套技能 用数码的媒体 取代了我和其他高级领导者的做法
And yet, we need to have that shared sense.	我们现在需要一个有共享的意识

We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007, and an old friend of mine, that I had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note, just in an envelope, that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot, that you would come, if alive."	2007年我们在阿富汗的行动非常艰难 我的一个老朋友 我们交往了多年 在我职业生涯多个重要的点上 我还是他一个孩子的教父 他给我寄了张纸条,就放在一个信封里 是Sherman和Grant书信里的摘录 说，我知道如果我困住了， 你是会来的，如果你还活着。

There is nothing bigger or older than the universe.	没什么比宇宙更广大更久远的了。
The questions I would like to talk about are: one, where did we come from?	您们的问题中我想聊一下的是: 您我何从?
How did the universe come into being?	宇宙何来?
Are we alone in the universe?	宇宙中就只有我们?
Is there alien life out there?	有外星异生物么?
What is the future of the human race?	人类的未来将会如何?
Up until the 1920s, everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time.	上世纪20年代之前, 所有人都以为宇宙基本上是处于稳态, 流金岁月, 持恒不变.
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding.	之后我们发现原来宇宙正在膨胀中.
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.	辽远星系一直飞离我们.
This meant they must have been closer together in the past.	这意味着它们必定曾相靠近.
If we extrapolate back, we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago.	我们若往后推算, 就会发现我们必都曾於约150亿年前 互相堆叠在一起.
This was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe.	正是这 霹雳大爆炸 - 宇宙之起始.
But was there anything before the Big Bang?	然而大爆炸前可有什么吗?
If not, what created the universe?	若是没有, 又是什么创造宇宙呢?
Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?	宇宙缘何要从大霹雳中冒出呢?
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts.	过往我们都认为宇宙论 可分成两部分.
First, there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe, given its state over all of space at one time.	首先, 是定律 像麦克斯韦方程组 和 广义相对论 以其于同一刻设定整个时空之状态, 而决定了宇宙之演化进程.
And second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe.	次之，是对宇宙雏形 的疑问.
We have made good progress on the first part, and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions.	第一部分我们取得良好进展, 除了 至极端境况 以外. 现在已对 演化规律于所有境况下之进程有所掌握.
But until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe.	可直至最近, 我们仍对宇宙初生当时之 周围条件不甚了了.
However, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct.	然而, 这演化律 及 初始条件 之界分 乃囿於时.空分明之概念内.
Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space.	而於极端条件下, 广义相对论及量子论 容许时间如同空间的另一维度般运作.
This removes the distinction between time and space, and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state.	这就将 时.空之间区别移除了 即是说 演化律 亦可决定初始状态.
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.	宇宙可以由无变有 自我创生!
Moreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states.	我们甚至可以计算出 宇宙在不同情况下诞生的可能性。
These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background, which is an imprint of the very early universe.	这些推论与 WMAP卫星 所观测到的宇宙微波背景辐射 相当一致.
We think we have solved the mystery of creation.	我们相信已勘破了创造奥秘
Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence.	或许我们应将 宇宙 给注册 然后向每个生存於世的人收 生活费.
I now turn to the second big question: are we alone, or is there other life in the universe?	现在我转到第二个 大问题 去 宇宙中就只有我们, 还是另有其它生物?
We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth, so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets, of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy.	我们相信生命从地球自我衍生, 故此生命确有可能出现於其它合适星球 - 星河中看来可有不少呢.
But we don't know how life first appeared.	但我们仍未搅通生命是如何生成:
We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing.	对於生命诞生的可能契机 我们有两项观测得来的佐证.
The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago.	首先我们有来自35亿年前 的海藻化石.
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.	地球於46亿年前形成 头约5亿年相信仍太热了.
So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible, which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type.	故此生命於 其变得可能后的5亿年间方出现, 这相对於像地球之类百亿年期的星体 只算是一段短时间.
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high.	这意味着生命出现的概率是颇高的.
If it was very low, one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available.	若是低的话, 就可预期要花尽 百亿年的绝大部分才会出现.
On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens.	另一方面, 我们似乎从未见有外星人到访.
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.	我不信那些什么 不明物体 的报导.
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes?	它们干吗要单向那些古古怪怪的人现身呢?
If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring, it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far.	若真有一个甚麽政府阴谋要将报导打住 从而将外星人所带来之科学识据为己有, 那可真像个既离奇, 亦从未见效的举措.
Furthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project, we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.	再说, 即便SETI计划已进行广泛探索, 我们还没有收听到任何外太空电视答问节目.
This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years.	这可能昭示在我们现阶段文明发展之 方圆数百光年范围之内 并没有其它外星异文化.
Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.	卖保险给那些 怕被外星人绑架的人，看来是个不错的选择。
This brings me to the last of the big questions: the future of the human race.	这送我到了最后一个大问题: 人类的前途.
If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy, we should make sure we survive and continue.	若我们是星河里唯一智能生物, 就必须确保自己能存活并延续下去.
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.	但我们正迈入历史中一个愈发危险的时段.
Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially, along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.	我们的人囗和对地球有限资源的耗用, 正以几何级数增长, 相随的 是我们将环境或弄好或弄垮的技术才能,
But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past.	至於我们的基因指令 则仍带着那自私和好斗的本质 这或有利於我们过往求存
It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years, let alone the next thousand or million.	却又让我们於往后数百年内 人祸难逃. 更别说未来千百万年了.
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain lurking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.	我们长活下去的唯一机会 不是一直呆着在地球 而是冲出太空去.
The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.	这些大问题之解答 显示我们于过去数百年取得可观进展.
But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years, our future is in space.	可若要超越未来数百年, 我们的前途在於太空.
That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say, personed -- space flight.	正因此，我较倾向于 人 控 - 或许我应说, 由人驾驶之太空旅航.
All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions.	我一生都在探究想要了解宇宙 并找出这些问题之答案.
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap.	我一直都非常幸运 我的残疾并没造成严重障礙;
Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge.	说真的, 这反倒让我比大部分人获得更多时间 以从事知识之追求.
The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe, and we are making good progress.	终极目标是一套完备的宇宙论, 而我们已有良好进展.
Thank you for listening.	感谢您们的聆听.
Professor, if you had to guess either way, do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way, as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher?	安德信: 教授, 若您必须二选其一作猜测, 此刻您是较相信还是较不相信 我们是天河中唯一 现水平或更高水平之智能文化?
This answer took seven minutes, and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED.	准备这答案已花了7分多钟, 真让我深切体会到 这整个演讲为TED所付出之 让人难以置信之慷慨.
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years; otherwise we would have heard radio waves.	霍金: 我想我们应该是 数百光年范围内之独一文明; 否则我们应已收听到电波.
The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long, but destroy themselves.	另一种可能是, 该等文明都维持不久, 就自我毁灭掉.
Professor Hawking, thank you for that answer.	安德信: 霍金教授, 谢谢您的解答.
We will take it as a salutary warning, I think, for the rest of our conference this week.	我想, 我们会将之作为 这一周余下会谈之座右铭.
Professor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today.	教授, 我们衷心感谢您今天为与我们分享您的问题 所作出之卓越贡献.
Thank you very much indeed.	真的非常感谢您.
So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China, the night I met my husband.	首先，我想带大家一起 回到一个 在中国的夜晚 那个与我丈夫初遇的夜晚
It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking.	那是挺久以前了, 北京还被称作 Peking (北京的英文旧称）
So I went to a party.	我当时参加一个聚会
I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie, and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar, there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations.	坐在一个戴着猫头鹰眼镜打着领结的 壮硕中年男人旁边 他原来是一名富布赖特学者 在中国从事 对中苏关系的研究

"Well, how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans?"	可是，如果我告诉你我是大豆协会的 你会跟我聊多久呢？
I said, "You jerk."	我说混蛋

He was a Chinese scholar who later, in his 60s, got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.	他是一个中文学者 在他60几岁的时候 还获得了中国历史的博士学位
He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids.	他会六种语言 15种乐器 他有飞行员执照 他做过旧金山缆车的司机 他在猪营养学，奶牛， 南方爵士，黑色电影方面都是专家 我们也一起周游了世界 生了很多孩子
We followed my job, and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do.	我们做了很多，似乎 没有什么是我们做不到的
So when we found the cancer, it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other, we believed that, if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough, and we worked hard enough, we could keep him from dying ever.	当他被诊断出癌症 对我们来说 这感觉一点也不陌生 我们相信 如果我们够聪明 够坚强和勇敢 并且努力奋斗 那他一定可以永远活下去
And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.	在好几年里，我们似乎获得了成功
The surgeon emerged from the surgery.	他接受过多次手术

Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely.	然后当医生仔细地检查过他的肾癌后 却又充满挫败

So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months.	我们尝试了另外一种治疗方法，激进而讨厌
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.	这让他非常难受，只好放弃 但是他还活着
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on.	又过了一年
Then another year goes by.	两年
Two years go by.	为了接受更多专家的治疗
More specialists.	我们带着孩子去意大利
We take the kids to Italy.	去澳大利亚
We take the kids to Australia.	更多年过去了 癌细胞又开始生长
And then more years pass, and the cancer begins to grow.	这次，又有新的治疗方法进入视线
This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.	诡异，而且还在试验中
They're exotic. They're experimental.	这是一种新的消灭癌症的方法
The cancer begins to shrink, and for the third time, we've dodged death.	我现在问你 我当时是什么感受 当最后时刻来临的时候 在那个 深夜两点的黑夜里
So what do I say when he says, "What do you want me to do?"	 我说了什么？

And Terence died six days later.	特伦斯死于六天之后
So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.	我们战斗过，挣扎过，也胜利过
It was an exhilarating fight, and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation.	这是一场令人振奋的战斗 我会毫不犹豫地 将战斗继续直至今天
We fought together, we lived together.	我们一起战斗，一起生活
It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious.	这原本是我们生命中 最严峻的七年，我们把它变成了 最辉煌的七年
It was also an expensive fight.	这是一场昂贵的战斗
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us.	这是一种我们每个人 都会赞成的 大量增加晚年健康支出的 战斗和选择
And for me, for us, we pushed the fight right over the edge, and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day: "Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."	对于我，对于我们 我们战斗到了最后一刻 我从来没有机会跟他说 这句我现在每天重复的话 嘿，这真是刺激的过程。
We never got the chance to say goodbye.	我们没有机会互相道别
We never thought it was the end.	我们没有想过那就是终结
We always had hope.	我们总是充满希望
So what do we make of all of this?	我们所做的这一切是为了什么？
Being a journalist, after Terence died, I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."	作为一个记者，在特伦斯逝世后 我写了一本书，希望的代价
I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did.	我写这本书是因为我想知道 我为什么会这么做 他为什么会这么做 我们每一个人为什么会这么做
And what did I discover?	那么我发现了什么？
Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.	其中一个便是 医生认为能解答 我在最后做了的事是一张纸 预先医疗指示 以帮助家人做出这一看似不合理的选择
Yet I had that piece of paper.	我们得到了这张纸
We both did.	我们都有
And they were readily available.	它们很容易获得
I had them right at hand.	我正把它们拿在手中
Both of them said the same thing: Do nothing if there is no further hope.	上面是同样一句话 如果没有希望，就不要再做什么了
I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.	我清楚地知道特伦斯的愿望 就如同我自己的一样
Yet we never got to no further hope.	我们从来没有完全失去希望
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope.	哪怕拿着这张意思明确的纸片 我们一直重新定义希望
I believed I could keep him from dying, and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way.	我相信我能阻止他的死亡 这么说我会不好意思，如果我 没有见过那么多，跟那么多有着相同情况的人 交谈过的话
Right up until days before his death, I felt strongly and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally, that I could keep him from dying ever.	直到他走的前一天 我仍然坚信 你可能觉得是不可理喻 但我坚信我能够阻止他的死亡
Now, what do the experts call this?	现在，专家们怎么称呼这种心态？
They say it's denial.	他们说这叫拒绝现实
It's a strong word, isn't it?	一个很强烈的词，是不是？
Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through.	我告诉你们 这个词远远不够强烈 完全不能描述我们这种 面对爱人死亡时的人的心情
And I hear the medical professionals say, "Well, we'd like to do such-and-such, but the family's in denial.	我听医生们会这么说， 我们想做什么什么， 但是被病人的家人拒绝。
The family won't listen to reason.	他们听不进任何理由，
They're in denial.	他们只会拒绝现实。
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?	他们怎么能到了最后还坚持这种治疗呢？
It's so clear, yet they're in denial."	很明显，他们拒绝接受现实。
Now, I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking.	我想这并不是 一个有效的思维方式
It's not just families either.	不仅仅是家人
You want to do.	你想做一些事情
You've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure.	你取得过很多成功 但是现在你的病人要死了 一定感觉非常失败
I saw it firsthand.	我理解这种挫折
Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, "Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."	就在特伦斯走的前几天 他的肿瘤医生说， 告诉特伦斯，过些天会好些的。
Days before he died.	就在去世的前几天
Yet Ira Byock, the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said, "You know, the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal."	达特茅斯学院缓和医疗部的 主管伊拉·比约克 说过，最优秀的医生 也无法使人长生不死。
So what the experts call "denial," I call "hope," and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design.	医生们所说的拒绝现实，我说的希望 然后我想借用 一个做软件界的朋友的一句话
You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human.	你重新定义拒绝现实和希望 这是作为人类的一个功能
It's not a bug.	而不是一个漏洞
It's a feature.	这是一个功能
So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion.	所以我们需要更具建设性地 去思考这一常见，深远 有力的人类情绪
It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it.	这是一种人类状态 但是我们的系统和我们的思维 并没有去接受并包容它
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night, and I believed it.	当特伦斯在那个遥远的夜晚给我说了一个故事 我相信了
Maybe I wanted to believe it.	也许我只是愿意去相信
And during Terence's illness, I, we, we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too.	在特伦斯生病期间 我们也同样愿意去相信 我们一起战斗的故事
Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt, it felt like giving up -- meant giving up not only his life but also our story, our story of us as fighters, the story of us as invincible, and for the doctors, the story of themselves as healers.	放弃战斗，这种放弃的感觉 不止意味着 放弃他的生命 同样意味着 放弃我们一起战斗的故事 放弃我们不可战胜的故事 放弃医生作为拯救者的 故事
So what do we need?	那我们需要的是什么？
Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.	我们可能不需要一张新的纸片
Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go.	而是需要一个新的故事 不是一个因为没有希望 而放弃战斗的故事 而是一个关于胜利 关于勇敢战斗 和优雅撤退的故事 一个承认 最优秀的将军也不能战胜每个敌人 最优秀的医生 也不能使人长生不死 一个再努力的妻子 也不能阻止 最勇敢可爱的丈夫 死亡的故事
People did mention hospice, but I wouldn't listen.	有人跟我提过临终关怀 不过我没有听
Hospice was for people who were dying, and Terence wasn't dying.	临终关怀是给将死之人的 但特伦斯并没有将要去世
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end.	最后，他只经历了四天的临终关怀 我确信，就像你们所知道的的 这是一个典型的结果 我们从来没有说再见 因为我们从没有准备好面对结束
We have a noble path to curing the disease, patients and doctors alike, but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying.	我们有高贵的治疗方式 病人和医生都有 但是我们并没有 高贵的死亡方式
Dying is seen as failing, and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together, but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.	死亡被认为是失败 我们有一个共同战斗的 英雄故事 却没有一个放手面对死亡的英雄故事
So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.	我们也许需要一个 承认结束，说再见的故事 也许我们新的故事 是关于一个英雄的战斗和离世
Terence loved poetry, and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets.	特伦斯喜爱诗作， 而希腊诗人康斯坦丁诺斯·卡瓦菲斯 则是我的最爱的诗人之一。
So I'll give you a couple lines from him.	这里我会引述他的几句诗
This is a poem about Mark Antony.	这首诗是关于马克·安东尼的。
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero, Cleopatra's guy?	马克·安东尼是个无坚不摧的英雄 她是埃及女王的男人
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.	埃及女王的男人之一
And he's been a pretty good general.	他是个不错的将军
He's won all the fights, he's eluded all the people that are out to get him, and yet this time, finally, he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost.	他赢了所有的战斗 他躲开了所有人的追捕 这一次，他最终 来到了亚历山大城 发现自己迷失了
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.	人们正在离开
They're singing.	边奏乐，边唱歌
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.	他在一瞬间知道自己被打败了
And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods, and it's time to let go.	他瞬间知道 自己被上帝抛弃 是时候选择离开了
And the poet tells him what to do.	这首诗告诉他如何去做
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye, a goodbye that's fit for a hero.	告诉他如何说一声高贵的再见 一个符合英雄身份的再见
"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing."	如同长期准备着， 仿佛勇敢面对着， 它成为你 值得战斗的城市， 迈着坚实的步伐与情感， 靠近窗口， 而不是一个懦夫的诉求 或抱怨， 作为最后的享受， 听着那声音， 那精湛的演奏组成的乐队， 与她告别， 你正在迷失的亚历山大。
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.	这是一个比生命更伟大男人的道别 对于一个 所有事 几乎所有事都能做的 男人的道别 一个保留了希望的男人的道别
And isn't that what we're missing?	这正不是我们所缺失的吗？
How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes?	我们如何才能理解 人们面对爱人做出的决定 不正是往往来自于强烈的，有力的 很多时候并不理智的 微薄的希望吗？
The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial.	紧紧抱住一点点希望 不是拒绝现实
It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our healthcare system -- doctors, patients, insurance companies, us, started accounting for the power of that hope.	而是人类基因的一部分 也许我们的医疗系统 医生，病人，保险公司以及我们 是时候开始计算希望的力量了
Hope isn't a bug.	希望不是一个漏洞
It's a feature.	而是是一个功能
Thank you.	谢谢
You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains, far from these beautiful mountains, where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different, which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product.	妳们知道，有一个小国坐落在在喜马拉雅山脉上， 在这些美丽山脉的远处，不丹王国的人们 决定做一件与众不同的事。 那就是测量他们国家的快乐指数 而不是他们的国民生产总值。
And why not?	那为什么不呢？
After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few, but a fundamental human right for all.	毕竟，快乐不仅是小部分幸运者的特权， 而是所有人的基本人权。
And what is happiness?	那什么是快乐？
Happiness is the freedom of choice.	快乐是能自由地选择。
The freedom to chose where to live, what to do, what to buy, what to sell, from whom, to whom, when and how.	自由选择住在哪里， 做什么，买什么，卖什么 向谁买，卖给谁，什么时候做买卖，怎样做买卖。
Where does choice come from?	选择从哪里来？
And who gets to express it, and how do we express it?	谁有权去表达它？而我们怎样体现它？
Well, one way to express choice is through the market.	体现选择的其中一个方法就是通过市场。
Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately, the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.	运作良好的市场提供多种选择，而且最终 让人们能够体现他们追求幸福。
The great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market.	伟大的印度经济学家，Amartya Sen，曾获得诺贝尔奖， 因为他证明了饥荒和食物的供给量关系不大， 但是和获取食物的能力 或者和一个人有权通过市场获取食物的能力息息相关。
In 1984, in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth, Ethiopia.	在1984年发生了一件只能被看作是 人类最大的犯罪的事，将近一百万人死于饥饿 就在我出生的国家，埃塞俄比亚。
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north, people could not access or entitle themselves to that food.	并不是因为当时没有足够的食物 而是因为 在国家南部的富饶地区实际上食物过剩了， 但是在北部的人们却无法获取 或者没有权利获得那些过剩的食物。
That was a turning point for my life.	这是我生命的一个转折点。
Most Africans today, by far, are farmers.	到目前为止的今天，大多数的非洲人都是农民。
And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large, small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.	而且总的来说，大多非洲农民 按他们所种土地面积而言算是小农民， 按他们能自由支配的资金数目而言，还有非常非常小的农民，。
African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.	如今的非洲是全球农业资金最为不足的国家之一，甚至之最。
Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated, compared to 40 percent in Asia.	在非洲，只有7%的耕地面积得到灌溉。 和亚洲相比，他们有40%。
African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, compared to 144 in Asia.	非洲的农民每公顷地只用22公斤的肥料， 和亚洲相比，他们是144公斤。
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.	亚洲的公路密度比非洲农村地区的要大六倍。
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America, and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.	拉丁美洲的拖拉机比非洲多八倍， 亚洲的拖拉机也比非洲多三倍。
The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice, and therefore without much freedom.	如今生活在非洲的小农民们没有多少选择， 也就因此没有多少自由可言。
His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty.	他的生活早已被 无休止的贫穷注定。
He comes to the market when prices are lowest, with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest, because he has no choice.	正当他收割完，带着辛苦劳作换来的少得可怜的农作物来到市场时， 却正值物价最低， 因为他没有选择。
She comes back to the market some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call the lean season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice.	几个月后她再来到市场， 这时物价是最高的，也就是我们所称的 淡季——这时食物匮乏—— 但是因为她要给家人买吃的，她没有选择。
The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists?	这里面真正的问题是，非洲农村地区的市场应该如何发展 才能驾驭创新和创业力量？ 而我们知道这样的力量是确实存在的。
Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz, in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient, but poor.	另一位著名的经济学家，Theodore Schultz， 在1974年赢得诺贝尔奖，因为她论证了农民 尽管有效率，却依然贫困。
Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rational and profit-minded just like everybody else.	这意味着，实际上，农民是理智的， 而且正如其他任何人一样，他们也想赚钱。
Well, we don't need, now, any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.	现在，我们不需要 更多的诺贝尔奖也能明白，农民想要获得 市场中他们应得的一份，他们也想赚钱，正如其他任何人一样。
And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business.	有一件事是很清楚的：至少我们现在都知道 非洲对买卖是开放的，
And that business is agriculture.	而这里所说的买卖就是农业。
Over two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.	二十多年前，世界坚持对非洲说 市场必须自由化，经济必须进行结构调整。
This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -- which they did rather inefficiently -- and let the private market do its magic.	这就意味着政府要 从买卖生意中退出。 而政府确实相当低效地退出了市场， 让自由市场施展自己的魔法。
Well, what happened over the last 25 years?	那么过去的25年发生了什么变化呢？
Did Africa feed itself?	非洲能自给自足吗？
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?	我们的农民变成了高产的商人吗？
I think we're all in this room, probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years, where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago, where food production per capita has stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.	我想，我们都聚在这里， 很可能是因为我们都知道，事实上，非洲是全球唯一一个 预计在未来十年饥饿和营养不良人口 将继续上升的地区。 现在食品进口的账单比起20年前 已经翻了一倍。 人均粮食产量 停滞不前，而且肥料的使用不但没有增多，反而减少了。
So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?	为什么农业市场没有像我们预期的那样运作呢？
The market reforms prompted by the West -- and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders -- trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.	西方国家推崇的这种市场改革到底哪里出错了？ 而我用了15年在非州游历考察， 对农业市场进行研究，并访问了 来自10到15个非洲国家的上百个商人， 试图去理解我们的市场改革到底哪里出错了。
And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water.	对于我来说，这个改革似乎 漏掉了最重要的东西。
Like its agriculture, Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.	比如说它的农业， 非洲的市场是极度资金不足并却毫无效率可言的。
We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market, and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets, are extremely high.	我们从我们在非州做的调查得知， 到达市场之前的转手费 和农村农业市场的交易风险 是非常高的。
In fact, only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market.	实际上，甚至只有三分之一的产自非洲的农产品 能到达市场。
Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as market information, grades and standards, and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.	非洲市场的不发达不仅是因为基础建设 如公路和电信，不完备，更因为 其缺乏所需的市场组织，比如 市场信息，评级和标准， 以及联系买卖双方的可靠方式。
Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles, in narrow networks of people they know and trust.	正因此，商品买卖双方往往只能在小范围内做交易， 在由他们认识和信任的人形成的人际网内做交易。
And because of that, as grain changes hands -- and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer -- every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa -- it also changes sacks.	而且正因此，随着谷物转手—— 而我已经计算过从农民到消费者这一路 需要转手4，5次。 每次转手——而我看到这样的事情发生在整个非洲农村地区—— 它还要换包装。
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar.	我当时觉得这很奇怪。
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality.	后来商人们对我说了一遍又一遍，我才真正明白只有这样， 人们才知道他们拿到的货物 的数量和质量。
And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals, and situations where there are deficits, for example.	这里面实际上强烈暗示了 比方说，市场对价格信号 以及供应不足的情况快速反应的能力。
It also has very high cost implications.	这同时也暗示了这一做法的费用之高。
I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that, because of the absence of grades and standards and market information, sacks have to be constantly changed.	我计算出26%的工业企业规定的商业加成 仅仅是因为没有 等级和标准制度，和市场消息 所以包装要不停地更换。
And this leads to very high handling costs.	这就导致了非常高昂的处理费。
For their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa, come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind -- trusting that they're going to have some sort of demand for their produce, and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market, the nearest local market they know -- where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.	对于生产出非洲大部分农业产品的小农民这部分人来说， 他们来到市场几乎是盲目地，一点信息都没有。 他们相信 他们的产品肯定会有一定的需求。 而让自己任由唯一一个市场 或者他们所知的最近的本地市场的商人任意摆布 他们讨不到更好的价钱，也降低不了风险。
Speaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.	说到风险，我们已经看到非洲粮食价格的 是全球最为反复无常的。
In Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.	在非洲，小农民们是首当其冲地承受着这种风险。
In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear.	实际上，在我看来，世界上，历史上没有任何一个地区 会指望农民来承受如非洲农民所承受的 这种市场风险。
And in my view, there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face.	在我看来，世界上也没有任何地方的农业 是建立在如今我们非洲农民 所面临的这种风险之上。
In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.	在埃塞俄比亚，打个比方，每年玉米价格的变化 高达五毛钱。
This kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers, but also direct implications for food security.	这种市场风险令人瞠目结舌，而且 这不仅对打算直接投资 高生产力技术的农民的鼓励政策有直接影响，比方说现代种子和肥料， 而且对食品安全有直接影响。
To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002, Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.	给你们举一个例子来说，在2001－2002这两年间， 埃塞俄比亚种玉米的农民有特大丰收。
That in turn, because of the weak marketing system, led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.	然而相应地，因为市场系统薄弱 导致本国的玉米价格下点了80%。
This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.	这使得光是收割谷物的农民来说都毫无利润可言。
And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002.	我们可以算一算，快到2002年的时候，30万吨的谷物 被留在田野里烂掉。
Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis, to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.	不到6个月，也就是2002年的7月，埃塞俄比亚宣布进入了一个严重的食品危机， 规模接近1984年的——那一年1400万人口面临饿死的威胁。
What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.	那一年还发生了一件事。 在雨水充沛， 过去谷物生产过剩的地区，农民们决定 退出肥料市场，不再使用肥料。 实际上肥料的使用量减少了27%。
This is a tragic example of arrested development, or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.	这是发展延滞的一个可悲例子， 或者是一个初露头角的绿色革命被扼杀的例子。
And this is not just specific to Ethiopia, but happens over and over, all over Africa.	然而这不仅仅只发生在埃塞俄比亚。 而是在整个非洲一次又一次地重演。
Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.	我今天来这里不是为了哀悼这个可悲的情况，也不是来抱怨什么。
I am here to tell you that change is in the air.	我来到这里是要告诉妳们，改变已经在悄然进行。
Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions, or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.	今天的非洲已经不是等待别人施舍救援的非洲， 也不是采用千篇一律的外国专家政策的非洲了。
Africa has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly, that markets don't happen by themselves.	非洲已经学会了，或者还正在学——尽管进程缓慢—— 市场不会自己形成和发展。
In the 1980s, it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right.	在20世纪80年代，人们都很流行 说要把价格拿准。
There was a very influential book about that, which was mainly about getting governments out of the market.	当时有本很有影响力的书就是关于这个的， 主要说要把政府赶出市场。
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.	我们现在意识到，要把市场拿准，不仅仅是 价格刺激，还要投资在正确的基础建设 和合适且必要的机构来创造 释放市场创新力的条件。
When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else.	当条件对了，我们就知道并且能能够看到 非洲农村的创新力已经准备好爆发了， 正如其他任何地方一样。
Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia, after nearly 30 years abroad.	大概3年前，我决定离开我舒适的工作， 不再做世界银行的驻华盛顿的高级经济学家， 而是回到我出生的地方，埃塞俄比亚， 结束了我将近30年的国外生活，
I did so for a simple reason.	我这样做的原因很简单。
After having spent more than a decade understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets, I decided it was time to do something about it.	通过二十多年的 理解，学习和尝试说服决策人和捐赠者 非洲的农业市场到底哪里出错了， 我认为是时候坐言起行。
I currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.	我最近在埃塞俄比亚倡议并领导着一个激动人心的新活动， 就是建立第一个埃塞俄比亚商品交易所，简称ECX。
Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept, is not new to the world.	如今商品交易所这个概念本身 对大家来说并不新鲜。
In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.	实际上，在1848，82名谷物商人和农民聚集在 伊利诺斯河和密歇根湖交界处的小镇， 试图建立一个更好的交易方法。
That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade, which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.	芝加哥交易所也就是这样诞生的， 它现在是全球最著名的商品交易所。
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.	当时芝加哥交易所的建立 也是为了同样的原因， 希望今天我们的农民也能从商品交易所当中受益。
In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.	在美国的中西部，过去农民往往把谷物装运到大船上， 然后送往上游的芝加哥市场。
But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found, or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.	然而一旦货物抵港，如果没有买家， 或者价格突然暴跌，农民就要承受重大的损失。
And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan, rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.	实际上，农民甚至会把谷物都倒进密歇根湖里， 也不愿花再多的钱把货物运回农场。
Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done.	人民需要避免这种极高的风险和重大的损失 催生出了期货市场， 而谷物的分级和验收的根本制度——签发仓库收据 建立在完成交易的基础至上。
From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market, which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.	从这里开始，市场最伟大的创新出现了， 买家和卖家不需要亲身出现，不需要亲眼监督， 也能够进行谷物买卖。
That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances, and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.	这就意味着谷物的交易能穿越很长的距离进行， 或者甚至穿越时间——能提前做18个月后的买卖。
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture, and the rise of Chicago to a global market, agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.	这个活动就是美国农业转变的核心， 也是芝加哥从一个本地小镇上升至国际市场， 农业市场，超级大国的主因。
Now, over the last century, we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries, and that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa -- products produced mainly in the south -- are actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.	如今，回顾上个世纪， 我们趋向于认为商品交易所是 西方工业国家的特权。 而棉，咖啡，可可的参考价格， 这些主要产于南部的产品， 实际上是在北方国家这些有组织的商品交易所 定的参考价格，或者价格。
But that is actually changing.	但是情况正在改变。
And we're seeing a shift -- powered mainly because of information technology -- a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.	而我们也正亲眼目睹着， 这个改变主要是由信息科技来推动， 是一个由市场支配到新兴市场的转变。
And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.	上个世纪，你们可以看到了西方交易所的份额 也就是美国占全球的交易所的份额 仅在过去的二十年就下跌了将近一半。
Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example, where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year.	同样的，这在印度却得到了骤增，比方说， 使用交易所的农村农民 在过去三年里每年激增2.7倍。
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology, aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.	这是由廉价的甚小口径终端技术推动的， 它们积极地联系农民，带领他们进入市场。
China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago, 2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world.	中国的大连商品交易所，三年前—— 也就是2004年，取代了芝加哥交易所，成为 全球第二大的商品交易所。
Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.	如今，在埃塞俄比亚，我们也正在设计 第一个有组织的埃塞俄比亚商品交易所。
We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities, Ethiopia's small farmers.	我们并不打算照搬芝加哥或者是 印度的模式， 而是根据埃塞额比亚的需求，实际情况和小农民 来特别量身定做。
So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.	因此ECX就是为埃塞俄比亚而专设的埃塞俄比亚的交易所。
We're creating a system that serves all market actors, that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.	我们正在创建的系统适合所有市场参与者。 它产生的诚实，信任，高效，透明 更使得小农民们能处理我所说到的那些风险。
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia, we've done something rather unique, which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective, or what we call the ECX Edge.	埃塞俄比亚商品交易所的设计 被我们注入了独特的元素。 我们采用了综合法， 或者是被我们称作ECX优势法。
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself.	ECX优势法基本建立了整个生态系统， 使得市场能在其中自行发展。
And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work.	这也是我们 在过去二十年研究非洲市场发展中学到的其中一点—— 那就是部分法是没有用的：
You've got one donor trying to develop market information, another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards, another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.	一个捐赠者打算发展市场信息， 另一个人打算支助或者继续完善等级和标准制度， 再有的人要做信息与通信技术，然而另外的人投资仓库，或者是仓库收据。
In our approach in Ethiopia, we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem, or environment, in which trade takes place.	而我们决定在埃塞俄比亚采取的方法， 是要把整个生态系统 或是整个贸易发生的环境纳入一起考虑。
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system, which will initially start as an open outcry, because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.	这就意味着交易所会经营一个贸易系统， 这在一开始会引起一片公然反对的声音。 因为我们认为，这个国家对全面电子贸易还没有准备好。
But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas.	然而同时，我们将做一些 全球没有任何一家交易所做过的事，那就是在农村 开一些类似咖啡网吧的场所。
So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call the remote access terminal centers -- and actually, without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things, simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.	这样一来，农民和小商客 就能来我们的终端中心，我们称为 远程接入终端中心。 人们无需购买电脑或者弄明白怎样拨号上网 或者这样那样的的问题，他们只需要看着 发生在亚的斯亚贝巴交易所的交易场地就可以了。
At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that -- and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country, in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.	同时，对这个市场来说相当重要的一点， 也是我们设计这个交易所很有创新性的一点， 就是这个交易所会在全国各地经营仓库， 让等级证书和仓库收据能在内完成。
And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system, to assure that payment is done appropriately, in the right amount and at the right time, so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.	相应的，我们将经营一个内部的清算系统 来保证支付能正常地 按时按量完成。 因此，基本上，我们是在这个系统当中建立信任和诚实。
Obviously, we work with exchange actors, and as we're developing the exchange market itself, we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework, the overarching legal framework for making this market work.	显然我们是和交易的参与者打交道， 而当我们发展这个交易市场本身的时候， 我们也同样在发展监管和法律的基础构架—— 一个能使整个市场良好运作的全面的法律架构。
So, in fact, our proclamation is going to parliament next month.	因此实际上，我们的宣言 下个月就会递交给议会。
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country, using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers.	真正重要的是ECX将会经营一个市场信息系统， 向全国各地的农民们传达实时价格， 使用甚小口径终端技术直接给农民 转达电子报价。
What this does is transforms, fundamentally, the farmers' relationship to the market.	根本上来说，这改变了 农民和市场之间的关系。
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market, eight to 10 kilometers away on average, and sell whatever they happened to have, without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.	以往的农民往往只能想到本地， 也就是说他或者她只会去最近的那个本地市场， 平均8到10公里以外， 并出售任何碰巧他们手头有的东西， 他们完全不懂附加值或其他任何的概念—— 如今的农民知道全国市场的价格。
And they start to think national, and even global.	而他们开始想到全国，甚至国际市场。
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions, but also planting decisions, on the basis of information coming from the futures price market.	他们不但开始做商业市场的决定， 也做种植决定，根据来自期货价格市场 的信息。
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium.	而且他们来到市场，知道什么等级的产品 能获取多少的附加值。
So all of this will transform farmers.	因此，所有的这些都改变了农民。
It will also transform the way traders do business.	这还会改变商人做生意的方式。
It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].	这会阻止他们做简单连续的，有限套利的交易， 使得他们真正战略性地考虑如何把谷物 从供应过剩的地区通过长距离运输到供应不足的地区。
Can Ethiopia do this?	埃塞俄比亚能做到这样吗？
It seems very ambitious.	这似乎过于野心。
But it will create new opportunities.	但是这将创造新的机会。
We believe that this initiative requires great political will, and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector, and really even the underlying legal framework.	我们相信，这个倡议需要有强大的政治决心， 而我们将会和财政部门，还有信息与通信技术部联合起来， 并且切实地平衡基本的法律构架。
We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.	我们相信改变的春风已经吹到了这里，而我们完全能够做到。
ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium, which starts in about eight months.	ECX是埃塞俄比亚新千年的市场， 将在未来八个月后启动。
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today.	我们世纪最后一届议会会议的开场白就是我们总统 向全国宣布这个 如今对本国最为重要的经济动议。
We believe that the stakes are high, but that the returns will be even greater.	我们相信风险是很高的， 但回报会更高。
ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market in agricultural commodities.	ECX还能成为泛非市场的 农业商品的交易平台。
Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.	埃塞俄比亚的国内市场价值约十亿美元。
And we feel that over the next five years, if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market, and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.	而且我们预期在接下来的五年里， 如果埃塞俄比亚能掌握哪怕是40%，只是40%的国内市场， 并仅仅增加市场价值的25%，市场的价值就会翻一倍。
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa's grain production, and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.	埃塞俄比亚的农业市场比 南非的谷物产量高出30%—— 而且实际上，埃塞俄比亚是非洲第二大的玉米生产国。
So the potential is there.	因此，潜力我们是有的。
The will is there.	决心我们是有的。
The commitment is there.	承诺我们是有的。
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture, and to change Africa.	我们认为我们有成功的价值定位 来改变农民的选择，来壮大我们的农业， 并来改变非洲。
So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.	因此我们在事业当中找到我们的快乐与幸福。
Thank you very much.	谢谢大家。
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old, we were playing on top of a bunk bed.	我七岁的时候我妹妹才五岁。 我们当时在一个双层床的上铺玩
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean, I'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do, and I wanted to play war.	那时候我比她大两岁 当然，我现在也比她大两岁 但是在当时这意味着她必须全都听我的 我想玩战争游戏
So we were up on top of our bunk beds.	于是我们爬到了双层床的上铺
Joe soldiers and weaponry.	另一边则是我妹妹的小马玩偶 时刻准备着进行一场骑兵突击
And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge.	后来我们对那天下午发生的事情有不同的说法 但是既然我妹妹今天不在场 我就跟你们说说到底发生了什么 事实就是我妹妹有点笨手笨脚的
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon, but since my sister is not here with us today, let me tell you the true story -- -- which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side.	不知道怎么回事，我这个做哥哥的既没碰她也没推她， 我妹妹艾米突然就从上铺掉下去了 狠狠地摔到了地上
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible.	这时候我突然想起来一星期之前 我才不小心弄破了艾米的胳膊
And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before ...	我颇具英雄气概地把她 从一个假想的扑面而来的狙击手子弹中推开 到现在她都还没有谢我呢 我当时可是拼了命的 她甚至都没看到那子弹迎面扑来 我可是拼命展示了我最厉害的一面
... heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet, for which I have yet to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn't even see it coming -- I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior.	然后我看到我妹妹的脸 她满脸痛苦、惊讶的表情 马上就要哭出来了，极有可能吵醒 习惯在漫长冬季午睡的父母
And I saw my sister's face, this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winter's nap for which they had settled.	所以我做了一件 一个手忙脚乱的七岁小孩唯一能想到的事，来扭转悲剧
And if you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times before.	如果你有孩子的话，你肯定见过好几百次了
I said, "Amy, Amy, wait. Don't cry. Don't cry.	我说，艾米，艾米，好了，别哭了，别哭了
Did you see how you landed?	你看到你是怎么落地的么？
No human lands on all fours like that.	人类是不会那样四脚朝地落下去的
Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."	艾米，我觉得这意味着你就是传说中的独角兽。
Now that was cheating, because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister, but Amy the special unicorn.	很明显这是骗她的，因为我妹妹现在最不想做的就是 那个受伤的五岁小妹妹艾米， 想做的是超级独角兽艾米
Of course, this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past.	当然，以前她是完全没有做独角兽这个想法的
And you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict, as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced, or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn.	于是就看到我那可怜的、被我控制了的妹妹如何纠结 她的小脑袋正在决定究竟是继续 回味刚才经历的那些 疼痛、折磨和惊讶 还是仔细考虑她作为独角兽的新身份
And the latter won out.	后者胜出了
Instead of crying, instead of ceasing our play, instead of waking my parents, with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me, instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn ...	于是她没哭，也没有停止游戏 更没有吵醒我们的父母 这些负面的影响都没有产生 她脸上划过一丝微笑 重新爬回到双层床的上铺，带着作为一只小独角兽的荣耀
... with one broken leg.	还有一条受伤的腿
When I first started talking about this research outside of academia, out with companies and schools, the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph.	当我刚开始在学术圈外谈论这个研究时 在公司以及学校 他们强调的第一件事就是 永远不要以图表开始你的谈话
The very first thing I want to do is start my talk with a graph.	我在这里想做的第一件事恰恰就是用图表开始我的演讲
What we found is -- If I got this data back studying you here in the room, I would be thrilled, because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there, and that means that I can get published, which is all that really matters.	我们从这些数据中发现—— 如果我用这些数据来研究在座的各位，估计我会很兴奋 因为很明显这里有一个趋势 这意味着我可以将这个出版了 这才是最关键的
The fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve, there's one weirdo in the room -- I know who you are, I saw you earlier -- that's no problem.	事实是这个曲线上方有一个奇怪的红点 就是说在座有一个古怪的人 我知道是哪位，刚才我看到你了 这个不是问题
That's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot.	你们都知道，这并不是问题 因为我完全可以删除这个点
I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error.	我能删掉它是因为这明显是一个测量错误
And we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data.	我们都知道它是一个测量错误 因为它把我的数据弄乱了
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdos.	所以通常经济学、统计学、商务学以及心理学课程 都会教大家的一件事 是为保持数据的有效性，我们如何删除奇怪的数据
How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit?	我们如何通过删除异常值 来找出最合适的曲线呢？
Which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking -- two.	令人惊讶的是，当我试图研究 每个人应该服用的雅维数量时，我发现应该是两粒
But if I'm interested in potential, if I'm interested in your potential, or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity, what we're doing is we're creating the cult of the average with science.	但是如果我对可能性感兴趣，如果我对你的潜力 或者快乐、生产力 或者精力、创造力感兴趣， 我们现在所做的就是对科学里的平均概念的迷信
If I asked a question like, "How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?"	如果我问一个问题，比如说 一个孩子在教室里学习阅读能有多快？
scientists change the answer to "How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?"	科学家们会把问题变成孩子在教室学习阅读 的平均速度是多少？
and then we tailor the class right towards the average.	然后我们会把教室里的孩子都设想成平均水平
Now if you fall below the average on this curve, then psychologists get thrilled, because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder, or hopefully both.	如果你低于这个平均线 心理学家就会感到很惊讶 因为这意味着你要么有抑郁症要么有身心障碍 或者很可能二者兼具
We're hoping for both because our business model is, if you come into a therapy session with one problem, we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10, so you keep coming back over and over again.	我们希望你二者兼具，因为我们的商业模式是 如果你因为一个毛病来进行治疗 我们希望你离开的时候知道自己其实是有10个毛病的 这样你就会一遍又一遍地来进行治疗
We'll go back into your childhood if necessary, but eventually what we want to do is make you normal again.	如果必要的话我们会追溯到你的童年 但是最后我们想做的是使你变得正常
But normal is merely average.	但是正常这个概念只是指的平均水平
And what I posit and what positive psychology posits is that if we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average.	我以及积极心理学家们假设的是 如果我们只研究平均水平 我们就会一直停留在平均水平上
Why is it that some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual ability, athletic ability, musical ability, creativity, energy levels, your resiliency in the face of challenge, your sense of humor?	 包括你的智商、运动能力、音乐才能 创造力、精力 面对挑战的弹性以及幽默感？
Whatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you.	不管是哪方面，我不会删除你，而是去研究你
Because maybe we can glean information -- not just how to move people up to the average, but how we can move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide.	因为或许我们可以收集信息 不仅仅是把平均值下面的人提高到平均曲线上去 而是如何将整个平均曲线提高 无论是在全世界范围内的公司还是学校都是如此
The reason this graph is important to me is, when I turn on the news, it seems like the majority of the information is not positive, in fact it's negative.	这个图表对我很重要 因为每当我打开新闻频道时，似乎大部分的信息 都不是积极的，事实上是消极的
Most of it's about murder, corruption, diseases, natural disasters.	大部分都是关于谋杀、腐败、疾病、自然灾害
And very quickly, my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world.	我立即想到 这才是世界上真正的消极和积极所占的比例
Bobo married Amy the unicorn.	波波和我那个独角兽艾米妹妹结婚了
Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School, and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."	有一天他从耶鲁医学院 给我打来电话 他说，肖恩，我得麻风病了
Which, even at Yale, is extraordinarily rare.	这个病，在耶鲁都是其极罕见的
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.	但是我不知道怎么来安慰可怜的波波 因为过去的整整一礼拜他一直在克服自己的更年期问题
See what we're finding is it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.	所以我们发现并不一定是现实世界造就我们 而是我们大脑用来看世界的那个镜片造就了我们的现实世界
And if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time.	如果我们换一副镜片，我们不仅可以改变自己的快乐程度 同时还能改变每一个教育或者商业结果
When I applied to Harvard, I applied on a dare.	当年申请哈佛的时候，我完全是放手一试的
I didn't expect to get in, and my family had no money for college.	我并没有期望能被录取，家里也没有钱供我去读大学
When I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they allowed me to go.	两周后我拿到了军事奖学金，哈佛录取我了
Suddenly, something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality.	突然，一个连可能都谈不上的事情变成现实了
When I went there, I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well, that they'd be excited to be there.	当我到了哈佛，我以为其他人也都跟我一样把来这里读书当做一个荣耀 他们到这里来肯定都特别兴奋
Even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you, you'd be happy just to be in that classroom, which is what I felt.	即使你坐在一个满是比你聪明的人的教室里 你也会很高兴，只是仅仅坐在那个教室就很快乐，这是我当时的感觉
But what I found there is, while some people experience that, when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students -- Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.	但是我发现 同时其他人也有类似体会 四年之后我从哈佛毕业 然后在学生宿舍和他们住了八年 这可是哈佛邀请我去的，我可不是那种八年毕不了业的人
I was an officer of Harvard to counsel students through the difficult four years.	我作为哈佛的咨询师帮助学生们在四年大学时光进行心理咨询
And what I found in my research and my teaching is that these students, no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school, two weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there, nor on their philosophy or their physics.	在我的研究和教学中 我发现，无论这些学生入学之前取得的成功 让他们多么快乐 两周之后他们的注意力就不在作为一名哈佛学子的荣耀感了 也不在哲学或者物理学上面
Their brain was focused on the competition, the workload, the hassles, the stresses, the complaints.	他们的注意力集中在竞争、作业、 各种烦恼、压力和抱怨上面
When I first went in there, I walked into the freshmen dining hall, which is where my friends from Waco, Texas, which is where I grew up -- I know some of you have heard of it.	当我第一次开始工作的时候，我走进了新生食堂 我的来自德克萨斯州瓦克市的朋友在那里等我，我就是在瓦克市长大的 我知道你们可能有人听说过这个地方
When they'd come to visit me, they'd look around, they'd say, "This freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's from the movie "Harry Potter," which it does.	他们来看望我，并在食堂里四处参观 他们说，这个新生食堂看起来有点像 电影哈利·波特里面霍格瓦茨魔法学校的食堂。
And when they see this, they say, "Shawn, why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard?	当他们看到这些时， 他们说，肖恩，你为什么浪费时间在哈佛研究快乐这个问题呢？
Seriously, what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?"	说真的，哈佛大学的学生有什么 感到不快乐的理由么？
Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness.	这个问题恰恰包含了 理解快乐这门科学的关键
Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels, when in reality, if I know everything about your external world, I can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness.	因为这个问题假设 通过外部条件是可以预测我们的快乐程度的 但实际上，如果我了解你所有的外部条件 我只能预测你长期快乐程度的10%。
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world.	剩下的90% 都不是靠外部条件可以预测的 而是取决于你的大脑如何理解这个世界
And if we change it, if we change our formula for happiness and success, what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality.	如果我们做一点改变 改变我们关于快乐和成功的定义准则 我们需要改变 自己影响现实的方式
What we found is that only 25 percent of job successes are predicted by I.Q.	我们发现只有25%的职业成功 是由IQ决定的
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels, your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.	其余75% 是由你的积极程度、人脉 以及把压力视为挑战而不是威胁的能力决定的
I talked to a boarding school up in New England, probably the most prestigious boarding school, and they said, "We already know that.	我跟新英格兰一个寄宿学校谈起这个问题，这个学校应该是最著名的寄宿学校 他们说，我们知道这个问题，
So every year, instead of just teaching our students, we also have a wellness week.	所以每年，我们不仅教学，我们还有一周健康课。
And we're so excited.	这个事情让我们都很兴奋。
Monday night we have the world's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression.	周一晚上请世界著名专家 来讲青少年抑郁问题
Tuesday night it's school violence and bullying.	周二晚上讲校园暴力和恃强欺弱问题
Wednesday night is eating disorders.	周三晚上是饮食紊乱问题
Thursday night is elicit drug use.	周四晚上是吸毒问题
And Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness."	周五晚上我们正在讨论危险的性行为与快乐之间的抉择
I said, "That's most people's Friday nights."	我说，大多数人周五晚都考虑这个
Which I'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all.	很高兴你们喜欢这个回答，但是他们似乎一点都不喜欢
Silence on the phone.	电话里一阵沉默
And into the silence, I said, "I'd be happy to speak at your school, but just so you know, that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week.	为了打破沉默，我说我很乐意在贵校做演讲， 但是你们也知道，这其实不是健康周，而是疾病周
What you've done is you've outlined all the negative things that can happen, but not talked about the positive."	你们列出了可能发生的消极事情 却没有提到积极的方面。
The absence of disease is not health.	没有疾病并不代表健康
Here's how we get to health: We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success.	我们应该这样获得健康： 我们需要重新定义健康和成功的概念
In the last three years, I've traveled to 45 different countries, working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn.	过去的三年里，我到过45个国家 和那里的学校、公司合作 在这个经济危机时期
And what I found is that most companies and schools follow a formula for success, which is this: If I work harder, I'll be more successful.	我发现大部分公司和学校 有这样一个成功的准则，就是 如果我更努力，我就会更成功
And if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier.	如果我更成功，我就会更快乐
That undergirds most of our parenting styles, our managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior.	这符合我们大多数父母的教育方式，以及公司的管理方式 也符合我们行为激励的原则
And the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons.	但问题是从科学角度说这个观点是不成立的，是落后的，有两点原因
First, every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like.	第一，每次你觉得成功的时候 你就会对成功重新进行定义
You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better school, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we're going to change your sales target.	比如你取得了好成绩，接下来你必须取得更好的成绩 你进了一所好学校，接下来你必须进入更好的学校 你找到了一个好工作，下一步你得找到一个更好的工作 你达到了销售目标，下一步必须制定更多的销售目标
And if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there.	如果说快乐在成功的相反面，你永远不会得到快乐
What we've done is we've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society.	我们所做的是把成功抬高到了 社会的认知层面以外
And that's because we think we have to be successful, then we'll be happier.	这是因为我们觉得我们必须成功 这样才会快乐
But the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order.	但真正的问题是我们的大脑却在相反的方向运行
If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than it does at negative, neutral or stressed.	如果你现在可以提高某个人的积极心理程度 那么他的大脑就会经历我们称为快乐优势论的过程 这时你的大脑在积极方面的表现 明显优于 它在消极、中立或者沮丧方面的表现
Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.	你的智商提高、创造力提高、精力也提高了
In fact, what we've found is that every single business outcome improves.	事实上，我们发现 每件事的结果都改善了
Your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed.	处于积极状态的大脑的生产力比 处于消极、中立或者沮丧状态下高31%
You're 37 percent better at sales.	你的销售额能提高37%
Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed.	医生得出正确诊断的速度和准确率 也提高了19% 当他的大脑处于积极状态而不是消极、中立或沮丧状态下
Which means we can reverse the formula.	这意味着我们可以彻底改变这个准则
If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present, then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently.	如果现在我们可以找到一种使自己变得积极的方法 那么大脑运转会更成功 我们会工作得更努力、更快速、更聪明。
We've found that there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive.	我们发现你可以通过训练自己的大脑 来使自己更加积极
In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row, we can actually rewire your brain, allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully.	在一个连续21天进行的每次持续两分钟的实验里 我们可以重新连接你的大脑线路 使你的大脑可以变得 更积极、更成功
We've done these things in research now in every single company that I've worked with, getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row, three new things each day.	我们现在正在做这些研究 在我合作过的每一个公司 让他们写下三件他们要感谢的事情 连续21天，每天三件新的事情
And at the end of that, their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world, not for the negative, but for the positive first.	这个实验结束的时候 他们的大脑会形成一种模式 首先会以积极的心态看待这个世界，而不是消极的
Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it.	回顾过去24小时你经历的一件积极的事情 会让你的大脑重新经历一遍那件事情
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters.	实践告诉人们你的行为是很重要的
We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand.	我们发现冥想可以 使你克服文化多动症 这个多动症是由于我们同时做不同的事情造成的 冥想可以让你的大脑集中精力在手头的一项工作中
And finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness.	最后，看似随机的善举其实是有意识的善举
We get people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network.	当人们打开收件箱时， 我们让他们写一封积极的邮件 表扬或者感谢他们社交网中的某个人
And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies, what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success, and in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity, but create a real revolution.	通过这些行为 就像训练身体一样训练大脑 我们发现我们可以彻底改变快乐和成功的准则 通过这些事情，我们不仅可以创造出积极的影响力 还可以创造一个真正的革命
Thank you very much.	非常感谢
I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work.	今天我想谈谈 劳动和工作。
When we think about how people work, the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze -- that all people care about is money, and the moment we give people money, we can direct them to work one way, we can direct them to work another way.	当谈到人们是如何工作的时候， 我们首先联想到的是 迷宫中的老鼠 -- 他们在乎的只有金钱， 只要我们付钱给他们， 我们就能随心所欲地指挥他们， 让他们这样工作，或者那样工作。
This is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways.	正因为此，我们给银行家奖金， 用各种方式进行金钱激励。
And we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like.	我们用一种非常简单的方法 来看待人们工作的动因 以及劳动市场的状况。
At the same time, if you think about it, there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us.	同时，如果你稍微想想就会发现 这个世界上有各种各样奇怪的行为。
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing.	以登山运动为例，
If you read books of people who climb mountains, difficult mountains, do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness?	如果你读读那些登山人写的书， 那些有挑战性的山， 你认为那些书是充满着 欢乐和幸福的瞬间吗？
No, they are full of misery.	不，全是描写痛苦的。
In fact, it's all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold, challenging circumstances.	实际上，书中所讲的都是 关于冻伤之苦，前行之艰难， 和呼吸困难 -- 寒冷，极具挑战性的生存环境。
And if people were just trying to be happy, the moment they would get to the top, they would say, "This was a terrible mistake.	如果人们追求的是快乐， 当他们到达山顶的那一刻， 他们可能会说，这真是个可怕的错误。
I'll never do it again."	我再也不会做这种事情了。
"Instead, let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos."	(笑声） 我还是坐在沙滩上喝 Mojito吧。
But instead, people go down, and after they recover, they go up again.	但相反，在人们下了山， 恢复了之后，他们又一次向山顶进发了。
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example, it suggests all kinds of things.	如果将登山当做一个例子的话， 它可以说明很多事情。
It suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.	它说明，我们在意实现目标，到达峰顶。
It suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.	它说明，我们在意竞争，在意挑战。
It suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways.	它还意味着， 有很多不同的事情， 以不同的方式来激励我们去工作。
And for me personally, I started thinking about this after a student came to visit me.	对我个人而言，我开始思考这个问题 是因一个学生的拜访而起。
This was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier.	几年前，他是我的一个学生。
And he came one day back to campus.	有一天他回到了校园。
And he told me the following story: He said that for more than two weeks, he was working on a PowerPoint presentation.	他给我讲了个故事： 他说，他用了两个多星期的时间 来做一个演示文稿。
He was working in a big bank.	那时他在一家很大的银行工作。
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition.	这个演示文稿是用于公司合并和收购的。
And he was working very hard on this presentation -- graphs, tables, information.	他非常努力地在做这份演示文稿 -- 图表，表格，相关信息。
He stayed late at night every day.	每天都熬夜到很晚。
And the day before it was due, he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss, and his boss wrote him back and said, "Nice presentation, but the merger is canceled."	在截止日期的前一天， 他把这份演示文稿传给了他的老板， 老板在回信中说道，  演示文稿做得很不错，但这项合并计划取消了。
And the guy was deeply depressed.	这消息让这家伙非常沮丧。
Now at the moment when he was working, he was actually quite happy.	本来在他做这个任务的时候， 他是很开心的。
Every night he was enjoying his work, he was staying late, he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation.	每天晚上都享受着这份工作， 享受着熬着夜，不断完善他的演示文稿。
But knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed.	但在知道没人会看到他的成果之后，他沮丧极了。
So I started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor.	于是我开始思索如何通过实验来验证 劳动成果所能发挥的作用。
And to start with, we created a little experiment in which we gave people Legos, and we asked them to build with Legos.	首先，我们设计了一个小实验 我们先给测试者一些乐高积木，让他们来搭建。
And for some people, we gave them Legos and we said, "Hey, would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars?	在给其中一些人提供积木的时候， 我们对他们说， 嘿， 想不想拼装这样一个生化战士来赚 3 美元？
We'll pay you three dollars for it."	我们为此会付给你 3 美元的。
And people said yes, and they built with these Legos.	他们答应了，然后就开始动手拼装乐高积木。
And when they finished, we took it, we put it under the table, and we said, "Would you like to build another one, this time for $2.70?"	等他们完成了，我们就拿走它，放在桌子下面， 然后们说，再做一个怎么样?
If they said yes, we gave them another one.	如果他们同意的话，我们就再给他们一个。
And when they finished, we asked them, "Do you want to build another one?"	等他们拼完之后，我们又问， 还想再做一个吗？
for $2.40, $2.10, and so on, until at some point people said, "No more.	 分别付给他们 2.4 美元，2.1 美元，依此类推。
It's not worth it for me."	 直到人们说 不用了，已经不值得我去做了。
This was what we called the meaningful condition.	这就是我们所称作的意义条件。
People built one Bionicle after another.	人们一个接一个地制作生化战士。
After they finished every one of them, we put them under the table.	每当他们完成一个， 我们就把它拿到桌子底下。
And we told them that at the end of the experiment, we will take all these Bionicles, we will disassemble them, we will put them back in the boxes, and we will use it for the next participant.	然后在实验的最后我们告诉他们， 他们做的这些生化战士将会被拿走拆掉， 被放回盒子里，给下一个测试者用。
There was another condition.	还有另外一种情境。
This other condition was inspired by David, my student.	这情境是受我的学生 David 而启发。
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition.	这种情况被我们称为西西弗斯情境。
And if you remember the story about Sisyphus, Sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill, and when he almost got to the end, the rock would roll over, and he would have to start again.	还记得关于西西弗斯的那个传说吗？ 西西弗斯被神惩罚 将一块岩石推到山上去， 每当他就要到达山顶的时候， 那石头就会滚回去， 然后他必须重头再来。
And you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work.	这个故事告诉人们无用工作的本质。
You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills, at least he would have some sense of progress.	你可以想象，如果他是在不同的山上推着石头， 至少他会有点儿成就感。
Also, if you look at prison movies, sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole and when the prisoner is finished, they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again.	或者，如果你看过监狱题材的电影的话， 有时看守是这样折磨犯人的 先让他们去挖洞 当他们挖好洞之后， 又叫他们把那个洞填上，然后再重新挖。
There's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating.	这种循环模式 反复再反复地做同一件事情 似乎特别的让人感到消极。
So in the second condition of this experiment, that's exactly what we did.	而我们的第二种实验情境 正是用这个方法。
We asked people, "Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars?"	我们问道：给你 3 美元， 你愿意拼装这个生化战士吗？
And if they said yes, they built it.	如果他们同意，就开始拼装。
Then we asked them, "Do you want to build another one for $2.70?"	我们接着问，现在给你 2.7 美元，你愿意再做一个吗？
And if they said yes, we gave them a new one, and as they were building it, we took apart the one that they just finished.	如果他们愿意，我们就再给他们一个， 就在他们拼装第二个的时候， 我们把他们之前做好的那个拆开。
And when they finished that, we said, "Would you like to build another one, this time for 30 cents less?"	在他们拼完后， 我们问，这次再少给你 30 美分， 你还愿意再做一个吗？
And if they said yes, we gave them the one that they built and we broke.	如果他们愿意， 我们就把之前拼完又拆开的那个给他们。
So this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes.	这就成了一个无限循环 他们忙着拼装， 而我们当着他们的面把它们拆了。
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions?	当把这两种情况对比会发生什么呢？
The first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles -- they built 11 versus seven -- in the meaningful condition versus the Sisyphus condition.	首先我们发现， 相比西西弗斯情境，在意义情境下 受试者拼装了更多的生化战士 -- 11 比 7。
And by the way, we should point out that this was not a big meaning.	同时，我们必须指出， 这个意义条件并非特别重大。
People were not curing cancer or building bridges.	他们不是在治疗癌症也不是建造大桥，
People were building Bionicles for a few cents.	只是拼装生化战士赚几美分而已。
And not only that, everybody knew that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon.	不仅如此，每个人都知道，它们将很快被拆掉。
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning.	因此这并没有什么重大的意义。
But even the small meaning made a difference.	但即使再小的意义也有所影响。
Now we had another version of this experiment.	然后我们又做了另外一个版本的实验。
In this other version of the experiment, we didn't put people in this situation, we just described to them the situation, much as I am describing to you now, and we asked them to predict what the result would be.	在新的实验中， 我们不把人们至于这个情境之中， 而只是向他们描述实验情境， 就像我现在向你们所描述的这样， 然后我们让他们预测实验的可能结果。
What happened?	这次发生了什么呢?
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude.	受试者都预测对了结果， 但是没有猜对这个结果的程度。
People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more Bionicle.	那些被告知实验细节的测试者 认为在有意义情景中， 人们可能会多拼装一个生化战士。
So people understand that meaning is important, they just don't understand the magnitude of the importance, the extent to which it's important.	由此可见，人们是知道意义的重要性的。 只是不清楚有多重要， 它的重要程度到底多深。
There was one other piece of data we looked at.	我们还将考虑了另一项因素。
If you think about it, there are some people who love Legos and some people who don't.	考虑到在这其中， 有些人喜欢乐高而有些则不喜欢。
And you would speculate that the people who love Legos will build more Legos, even for less money, because after all, they get more internal joy from it.	你可以推测那些喜欢乐高的人 会愿意拼乐高，即使回报少一点， 毕竟他们会从中得到更多的快乐。
And the people who love Legos less will build less Legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower.	而那些没那么喜欢乐高的人 拼装的数量较少 因为他们从中得到的快乐较少。
And that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition.	这正是我们在意义情境中得到的结论。
There was a very nice correlation between love of Lego and the amount of Legos people built.	对乐高的喜爱程度和拼装的乐高的数量之间 有一种十分奇妙的关联。
What happened in the Sisyphic condition?	那么在西西弗斯情境下发生了什么呢？
In that condition the correlation was zero.	这种情境下的关联度为零。
There was no relationship between the love of Lego and how much people built, which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people's eyes, we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity.	人们对乐高的喜爱程度与拼装数量没有关联， 这也就说明我们通过 当着人们的面拆掉他们的劳动成果 会毁掉了人们从劳动中得到的乐趣。
We basically eliminated it.	我们几乎彻底抹杀了乐趣。
Soon after I finished running this experiment, I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle.	在完成了这项实验的之后不久， 我去了西雅图的一家软件公司。
I can't tell you who they were, but they were a big company in Seattle.	我不能告诉你们具体是哪家公司， 但那是西雅图的一家大公司。
And this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building.	在这家软件公司里有一群人 是被安置在另一座大楼里工作的
And they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company.	他们负责为公司创造和革新下一代产品。
And the week before I showed up, the CEO of this big software company went to that group, 200 engineers, and canceled the project.	而就在我到那儿一周之前， 这家公司的 CEO 来到这个 有 200 个工程师的小组， 取消了这项研发计划。
And I stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people I've ever talked to.	当时在我面前的这 200 个人 是我所交谈过的人中最郁闷的一群。
And I described to them some of these Lego experiments, and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment.	我向他们描述了这些乐高实验， 他们说他们感觉就像 刚刚经历过这些实验一样。
And I asked them, I said, "How many of you now show up to work later than you used to?"	于是我问道， 现在你们中哪些人比以前更晚上班了？
And everybody raised their hand.	所有人都举手了。
I said, "How many of you now go home earlier than you used to?"	我说，现在你们中哪些人比以前下班更早了？
And everybody raised their hand.	所有人都举手了。
I asked them, "How many of you now add not-so-kosher things to your expense reports?"	我又问道： 现在你们哪些人对开支报表动手脚了？
And they didn't really raise their hands, but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports.	他们并没有举手承认， 但他们邀请我去聚餐，然后向我演示了 他们能对开支报表做些什么。
And then I asked them, I said, "What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed?"	于是我问道，  当初你们的 CEO 要怎么做才能让你们不这么沮丧呢？
And they came up with all kinds of ideas.	他们给出了各种各样的想法。
They said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do.	比如 CEO 可以让他们向整个公司展示 他们这两年来走过的路， 以及他们原本计划做的事情。
He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization.	他本可以请他们思考这之中有哪些技术 可以应用于公司的其他领域。
He could have asked them to build some prototypes, some next-generation prototypes, and seen how they would work.	他本可以要他们做一些原型， 一些下一代产品的原型， 然后看它们是如何运行的。
But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation.	事实上每一个补救方案 都包含着努力和激励。
And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning.	而我认为这位 CEO 没有意识到意义的重要性。
If the CEO, just like our participants, thought the essence of meaning is unimportant, then he [wouldn't] care.	如果这位 CEO，像我们的受试者一样， 认为意义的本质并不重要， 那他当然不会在意。
And he would tell them, "At the moment I directed you in this way, and now that I am directing you in this way, everything will be okay."	他只会告诉他们，当时我要你这样做， 而现在我要你这样做， 一切都没有问题。
But if you understood how important meaning is, then you would figure out that it's actually important to spend some time, energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they're doing.	但如果你知道意义是多么地重要， 你就会了解到 去把时间、精力、努力花在 让人们更在意他们所做的事情上 实际上有多么重要。
The next experiment was slightly different.	下一个实验有点儿不同，
We took a sheet of paper with random letters, and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other.	我们用一张写着随机单词的纸， 要求人们将其中相似的词语配对。
That was the task.	这就是他们的任务。
And people did the first sheet.	当人们完成了第一张，
And then we asked them if they wanted to do the next sheet for a little bit less money and the next sheet for a little bit less money, and so on and so forth.	我们会问他们是否愿意再做一张， 但这次报酬再少一点 然后再下一张更少，依此类推。
And we had three conditions.	我们创设了三种情境。
In the first condition, people wrote their name on the sheet, found all the pairs of letters, gave it to the experimenter.	在第一种情境中， 测试者把自己的名字写在纸上， 找到所有配对的单词 并把它交给实验员。
The experimenter would look at it, scan it from top to bottom, say "uh huh" and put it on the pile next to them.	实验员会检查一遍，从头到尾， 轻声说嗯哼， 然后把它放在边上一堆纸上。
In the second condition, people did not write their name on it.	在第二种情境中，测试者不在纸上署名。
The experimenter looked at it, took the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it, and simply put it on the pile of pages.	实验员扫视一下， 接过来，看也不看一眼， 就直接放到那堆纸上面。
So you take a piece, you just put it on the side.	只是拿过来然后放到一边去。
And in the third condition, the experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder.	而在第三种情境中， 实验员接过那张纸， 看也不看就把它丢进碎纸机。
What happened in those three conditions?	那么在这三种情境下 分别发生了什么呢？
In this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped.	这个实验显示人们在什么时候会放弃。
So low numbers mean that people worked harder. They worked for much longer.	报酬越低说明人们越努力，撑得越久。
In the acknowledged condition, people worked all the way down to 15 cents.	在上述情境中，有人一直坚持到 15 美分那一步，
At 15 cents per page, they basically stopped these efforts.	到每张值 15 美分的时候，人们就不干了。
In the shredder condition, it was twice as much -- 30 cents per sheet.	在粉碎情境中，结果为两倍 -- 每张 30 美分的时候人们不干了。
And this is basically the result we had before.	这和我们之前的结果是差不多的。
You shred people's efforts, output, you get them not to be as happy with what they're doing.	你粉碎了人们的努力和成果， 他们对自己所做的就没有快乐可言。
But I should point out, by the way, that in the shredder condition, people could have cheated.	但我也顺便要指出， 在粉碎情境中，人们可能有作弊行为。
They could have done not so good work, because they realized that people were just shredding it.	他们的工作质量可能不高， 因为他们知道人们会直接把纸粉碎掉。
So maybe the first sheet you would do good work, but then you see nobody is really testing it, so you would do more and more and more.	所以可能第一张纸你会做得认真， 但后来你发现没人会检查， 那你就会不停地做下去。
So in fact, in the shredder condition, people could have submitted more work and gotten more money and put less effort into it.	所以实际上，在粉碎情境中， 人们可能做更多次实验，得更多的钱 但付出的努力却更少。
But what about the ignored condition?	但那个忽视情境又如何呢？
Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder, or somewhere in the middle?	它是更类似于认可情境还是粉碎情境， 或者介于两者之间？
It turns out it was almost like the shredder.	结果发现它和粉碎情境几乎是相同的。
Now there's good news and bad news here.	现在有一个好消息和一个坏消息。
The bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes.	坏消息是忽视人们的表现 几乎和在他们面前 粉碎他们的成果一样糟糕。
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there.	忽视让结果完全不同。
The good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done, scanning it and saying "uh huh," that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people's motivations.	好消息是只要稍微注意一下人们所做的， 浏览一下并应声嗯哼， 似乎就能非常有效地 提高人们的工作动力。
So the good news is that adding motivation doesn't seem to be so difficult.	所以好消息是提高动力并非难事。
The bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy, and if we don't think about it carefully, we might overdo it.	坏消息是打消动力 似乎也是非常简单， 如果我们不小心，可能就做过了头。
So this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation.	所以一切都是关于负面动力 以及消除负面动力。
The next part I want to show you is something about the positive motivation.	下面我想让你们看看正面动力。
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA.	在美国有一家店，叫宜家。
And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble.	宜家卖的都是质量一般 并且需要花很长时间组装的家具。
And I don't know about you, but every time I assemble one of those, it takes me much longer, it's much more effortful, it's much more confusing.	我不知道你们， 但是每次我组装家具， 都要花费更长的时间， 投入更多精力，更加令人迷惑。
I put things in the wrong way.	我把东西放错了位置，
I can't say enjoy those pieces.	我并不喜欢那些家具，
I can't say I enjoy the process.	我也并不享受这个过程，
But when I finish it, I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones.	但当我完成后，比起其他家具， 我似乎更喜欢宜家的家具。
And there's an old story about cake mixes.	有一个关于蛋糕粉的故事。
So when they started cake mixes in the '40s, they would take this powder and they would put it in a box, and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in, stir some water in it, mix it, put it in the oven, and -- voila!	当他们在 40 年代发明蛋糕粉的时候， 他们把蛋糕粉装进盒子里， 让主妇们只要倒出来加点水， 搅拌后放进烤箱，然后 -- 你看！
-- you had cake.	蛋糕就有了。
But it turns out they were very unpopular.	但结果它们并不非常受欢迎。
People did not want them.	人们不想要这些。
And they thought about all kinds of reasons for that.	他们思考了各种可能的原因，
Maybe the taste was not good.	可能是味道不够好，
No, the taste was great.	不对，味道其实很好。
What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved.	他们发现其实是 人们要付出的努力不够。
It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say, "Here is my cake."	过程太简单了， 没人想就这么对客人说， 这是我做的蛋糕。
No, no, no, it was somebody else's cake.	不，不，不，那人别人的蛋糕。
It was as if you bought it in the store.	就好像你从店里买了现成的。
It didn't really feel like your own.	感觉不像是你自己做的。
So what did they do?	然后人们怎么做呢？
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder.	他们把鸡蛋和奶都从蛋糕粉了去掉。
Now you had to break the eggs and add them.	现在你得自己把鸡蛋打碎了加进去。
You had to measure the milk and add it, mixing it.	你得算好牛奶的量加进去搅拌。
Now it was your cake.	现在这是你做的蛋糕了。
Now everything was fine.	一切都好了。
Now I think a little bit like the IKEA effect, by getting people to work harder, they actually got them to love what they're doing to a higher degree.	我觉得这个宜家效应有些相似， 通过让人们付出更多努力， 使人们更爱他们所作的事情。
So how do we look at this question experimentally?	那从实验角度我们如何看待这个问题呢？
We asked people to build some origami.	我们让受试者做折纸手工。
We gave them instructions on how to create origami, and we gave them a sheet of paper.	我们告诉他们折纸方法， 然后给他们一张纸。
And these were all novices, and they built something that was really quite ugly -- nothing like a frog or a crane.	他们都是新手，折的东西都很难看 -- 不像青蛙也不像鹤鸟。
But then we told them, we said, "Look, this origami really belongs to us.	然后我们说，你瞧，这个折纸实际上属于我们。
You worked for us, but I'll tell you what, we'll sell it to you.	你为我们工作，但你知道吗， 我们可以把它卖给你。
How much do you want to pay for it?"	你愿意出多少钱？
And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it.	然后我们看看他们愿意出多少。
And we had two types of people.	我们发现有两种人。
We had the people who built it, and we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers.	有些人选择折纸， 有些人选择不折，只是做个旁观者。
And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami, and they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally.	我们发现选择折的那些人 认为这些折纸很美， 与那些观察的人相比， 他们愿意出 5 倍的价钱买这些折纸。
Now you could say, if you were a builder, do you think that, "Oh, I love this origami, but I know that nobody else would love it?"	现在你说，如果你是折纸的人， 你会觉得，哦，我喜欢这个折纸， 但我知道没有其他人会喜欢？
Or do you think, "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?"	还是，我喜欢这个折纸， 其他人也会一样喜欢？
Which one of those two is correct?	这两种哪一种是正确的？
Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more, they thought that everybody would see the world in their view.	结果发现折纸的人不仅更喜欢折纸， 他们还认为所有人都和他们一样。
They thought everybody else would love it more as well.	他们认为所有人都会喜欢。
In the next version we tried to do the IKEA effect.	接下去一个实验版本， 我们尝试了宜家效应。
We tried to make it more difficult.	我们把实验难度提高。
So for some people we gave the same task.	所以我们给一些人同样的任务。
For some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions.	对另一些人我们把说明说藏起来， 增加难度。
At the top of the sheet, we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami.	纸张顶部有关于折纸的小说明。
For some people we just eliminated that.	对一些人我们就把说明删掉。
So now this was tougher.	现在难度增加了。
What happened?	会发生什么呢？
Well in an objective way, the origami now was uglier, it was more difficult.	客观来看，折纸现在更难看了， 难度更大了。
Now when we looked at the easy origami, we saw the same thing: Builders loved it more, evaluators loved it less.	当我们观察简单的折纸时， 我们有了同样的发现： 折纸的人更喜欢它，而观察的人则更不喜欢。
When you looked at the hard instructions, the effect was larger.	当说明书难度增高的时候， 该效应更为明显。
Why?	为什么？
Because now the builders loved it even more.	因为折纸的人更喜欢它了。
They put all this extra effort into it.	因为他们投入了额外的精力。
And evaluators?	而观察的人呢？
They loved it even less.	他们更不喜欢，
Because in reality it was even uglier than the first version.	因为实际上折纸比第一次更丑了。
Of course, this tells you something about how we evaluate things.	当然，这说明了我们是怎么观察事物的。
Now think about kids.	现在想想孩子。
Imagine I asked you, "How much would you sell your kids for?"	想象一下我问你， 要多少钱你肯把你的孩子卖了？
Your memories and associations and so on.	包括记忆以及相关联的东西等等。
Most people would say for a lot, a lot of money -- on good days.	大多数人会说，得要一大笔钱 -- 孩子乖的时候。
But imagine this was slightly different.	但想象一下如果情况稍微有些不同。
Imagine if you did not have your kids, and one day you went to the park and you met some kids, and they were just like your kids.	想象如果你自己的孩子没了， 有一天你去公园看见一些孩子， 他们和你的孩子好像，
And you played with them for a few hours.	你和他们玩了一会儿，
And when you were about to leave, the parents said, "Hey, by the way, just before you leave, if you're interested, they're for sale."	当你准备走的时候，父母说， 嘿，你走之前顺便提一下， 如果你有兴趣可以买我的孩子。
How much would you pay for them now?	你现在愿意出多少钱买呢？
Most people say not that much.	大多数人会说不多。
And this is because our kids are so valuable, not just because of who they are, but because of us, because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection.	这是因为我们的孩子是无价的， 不仅是因为他们本身， 还因为我们自己， 因为他们和我们如此亲密， 因为我们一起度过的时光和联系。
And by the way, if you think that IKEA instructions are not good, think about the instructions that come with kids.	另外，如果你觉得宜家的说明书不好， 想想孩子自带的说明书是怎么样的。
Those are really tough.	难度真的很高。
By the way, these are my kids, which, of course, are wonderful and so on.	另外，这些是我的孩子，当然他们非常棒。
Which comes to tell you one more thing, which is, much like our builders, when they look at the creature of their creation, we don't see that other people don't see things our way.	这表明了另外一个问题， 就是，和我们的创造者一样， 当看自己所创造出的东西， 我们不知道别人看到的和我们不一样。
Let me say one last comment.	让我说最后一个观点。
If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx, Adam Smith had the very important notion of efficiency.	当你想起亚当.史密斯和卡尔.马克思， 亚当史密斯有一句关于效率的名言。
He gave an example of a pin factory.	他举了一个制针工厂的例子。
He said pins have 12 different steps, and if one person does all 12 steps, production is very low.	他说制针共有 12 个步骤， 如果一个人做完 12 步，生产率非常低。
But if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on, production can increase tremendously.	但如果一个人负责一步， 另一个人负责下一步，以此类推， 生产率就会大大提高。
And indeed, this is a great example and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency.	确实，这是个很好的例子， 也是工业革命及生产效率的起因。
Karl Marx, on the other hand, said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing.	反过来，卡尔马克思说， 人们与劳动的异化 对人们对自己工作的认识非常重要。
And if you make all 12 steps, you care about the pin.	你如果负责 12 个步骤，你会在意你的劳动成果。
But if you make one step every time, maybe you don't care as much.	但如果你只负责一步，那就不会这么在意了。
And I think that in the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx, but the reality is that we've switched and now we're in the knowledge economy.	而我认为在工业革命中， 亚当斯密斯比卡尔马克思更正确， 但现实是我们环境变了， 现在处在知识经济时代中。
And you can ask yourself, what happens in a knowledge economy?	你可以自问，知识经济时代会带来什么？
Is efficiency still more important than meaning?	效率是否仍然比意义重要？
I think the answer is no.	我认为答案是否定的。
I think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort, attention, caring, how connected they feel to it, are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on, all of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us.	我认为我们已经过渡到了另一种状态， 人们必须自己决定 要投入多少精力、注意力和心意， 要多大关联性， 他们上班路上或者洗澡的时候会想着工作吗， 突然间马克思更有道理了。
So when we think about labor, we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing, but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it -- meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc.	因此当我们谈到劳动， 我们通常认为报酬就是动力， 但事实是它不止这些 -- 还包括意义、创造性、挑战、 所有权、自我意识、自豪感等等。
And the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them, how do we create our own meaning, pride, motivation, and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees, I think we could get people to both be more productive and happier.	好消息是如果我们加上 并且考虑所有这些因素， 如何创造我们自己的意义、自豪感、动力， 如何在工作地点实施，为雇员创造条件， 我相信我们能让人 既能高产出又能感觉更幸福。
Thank you very much.	非常感谢。
What I'd like to start off with is an observation, which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.	在演讲开始，我愿意先讲一个事情， 如果说去年有什么让我印象深刻， 就是极具讽刺意味的 出版一本号召讲将速度慢下来的书 你却不得不超快速的四处推销它。
I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city, studio to studio, interview to interview, serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.	我这些日子花了大部分时间， 在城市、演播室以及 访谈节目之间奔走， 但实际用来宣传书的时间却少的可怜。
Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly.	因为现在每个人 都想知道该如何放慢速度， 然而，他们却想要知道如何超快速的放慢速度。
So ...	所以...
so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.	前不久我在CNN上了一个通告 在那，我上电视的时间还没有化妆的时间长
And I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it?	而我想这还真算不上让人吃惊的事，对吧？
Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, a world stuck in fast-forward.	因为我们现在所处的，就是一个这样的世界 一个沉溺于追求快速前进的世界。
A world obsessed with speed, with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more into less and less time.	一个迷恋速度的世界， 做每一件事情都追求更快，往越来越少的时间里 填鸭进更多的东西。
Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock.	每一天每一刻都感觉像 在和时间赛跑
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again -- "These days even instant gratification takes too long."	引用凯利.费雪的一句话，这句话 在我的自传里面有写，我只是再次引用 现在大家连瞬间得到的快感都嫌太久。
And if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?	另外 假如让你想我们怎样才能将事情做得更好，会有什么主意？
No, we speed them up, don't we?	我们会加速做事情，不是么？
So we used to dial; now we speed dial.	所以，以前我们拨电话；现在我们快拨。
We used to read; now we speed read.	以前我们阅读；现在我们快读。
We used to walk; now we speed walk.	以前我们走路，现在我们快走。
And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.	当然还有，以前我们约会，现在我们速食约会。
And even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too.	即使是那些本身就需要慢慢做的事情 我们也千方百计加速做。
So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.	我最近在纽约，路过一家健身馆 他们橱窗上有一个新课程的广告，是个晚间课程。
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.	你猜得到吗，是关于快速瑜伽的。
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to, you know, salute the sun, but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.	这个就是为超级没时间的上班族们提供的最佳解决方案 这些人，想要练习（瑜伽）拜日式 但却只想花大约20分钟在这上面。
I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at.	我想，这些都是有点儿极端的例子， 而且都有些意思，可以当笑话听。
But there's a very serious point, and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life, we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us.	但是，这些例子也说明了一个非常严肃的问题， 在每天匆匆忙忙的生活中， 我们常常看不到 这种竞走式的生活方式给我们带来的伤害。
We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives -- on our health, our diet, our work, our relationships, the environment and our community.	我们已经在速食文化中淫浸得太深了 以至于我们几乎觉察不到它让 我们在生活方方面面所付出的代价。 对我们的健康，饮食，工作 人际关系，环境以及生活的社区都产生了消极的影响。
And sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life.	而有时候只要 一声警示来 提醒我们正在匆忙地度过我们的生命， 而不是真正有意义的过生活；提醒我们 我们在过快日子，而不是在过好日子。
And I think for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness.	而我认为对很多人而言，那个警示铃 常常是以疾病的形式出现。
You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, "I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel.	疾病突然爆发，最后身体对你说 我再也受不了了。然后就垮了。
Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time, or the patience, or the tranquility, to be with the other person, to listen to them.	也许这个警示会在一场恋爱化为泡影后出现 失败是因为我们抑或没有时间，抑或没有耐心， 或是不能安静地 陪着另一半，倾听他们的述说。
And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son, and I found that at the end of day, I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know, I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat."	而我的警示铃是在我开始 为我儿子念睡前故事的时候响起的， 我发现在一天结束之时， 我走进他的房间，就是不能把自己的速度慢下来 我会很快的念《戴帽子的猫》
I'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here, paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page, and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.	我会这儿跳过几句， 那儿概括几句，有时几句话概括一整页的内容 当然，我的小儿子对这本书倒背如流，所以我们就会争起来。
And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, the most tender moment of the day, when a dad sits down to read to his son, became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, a clash between my speed and his slowness.	当一个爸爸坐下来，为他的儿子读故事， 这本最应该是一天中最放松，最亲密， 最亲切柔软的时刻， 反而变成了这种角斗士般关于意志的争斗； 变成了他要快我要... 不，是我要快他要慢而引起的冲突
And this went on for some time, until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people.	而且这种情况持续了一段时间， 直到我读了报纸上的一篇文章 是为追求快速的人提供的省时窍门。
And one of them made reference to a series of books called "The One-Minute Bedtime Story."	其中一个窍门引用了一系列丛书作参考，叫做 一分钟的床前故事。
And I wince saying those words now, but my first reaction at the time was very different.	而我，现在真不愿意承认 但是我那时的第一反应和现在非常的不同。
My first reflex was to say, "Hallelujah -- what a great idea!	我的第一反应是说， 哈利路亚——这是个多么棒的点子！
This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more."	这正好能帮我把床前故事讲的更快一些。
But thankfully, a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, and I took a step back, and I thought, "Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this?	但还好， 我头脑一清醒，而我的下面的反应就非常不同了， 我退回一步想， 停，真的达到这种地步了吗？
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"	我真的忙到这种地步，要 在一天结束的时候，用一分钟故事来敷衍我儿子？
And I put away the newspaper -- and I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there, and I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing.	然后我把报纸拿开 我那时正在飞机上，我坐在那儿， 做了一件我很久没做过的事情——那就是我什么都没做。
I just thought, and I thought long and hard.	我就只是在思考，深思了很久时间。
And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.	而当我下飞机的时候，我决定我要对此做些什么。
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.	我要研究整个的速食文化， 以及这个文化对我，对其他人都产生了什么影响。
And I had two questions in my head.	在我脑海中产生了两个问题。
The first was, how did we get so fast?	第一个问题是，我们怎么变得这么快的？
And the second is, is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down?	第二个问题是，有没有可能慢下来， 或者，我们想慢下来么？
Now, if you think about how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.	现在，假如你思考 我们的世界是如何变得如此加速向前的，通常都怀疑是下面这些引起的
You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology.	我们会想到城市化， 消费主义，工厂，技术。
But I think if you cut through those forces, you get to what might be the deeper driver, the nub of the question, which is how we think about time itself.	但是我想，如果你透过 这些方面，你会思考到可能是更深层的 驱动力问题，这个问题的核心， 就是我们如何看待时间本身。
In other cultures, time is cyclical.	在其它文化中，时间是循环往复的。
It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles.	时间看起来是在巨大的 从容不迫的循环中移动。
It's always renewing and refreshing itself.	时间总是在不断复活，不断更新。
Whereas in the West, time is linear.	而在西方，时间是直线性的。
It's a finite resource; it's always draining away.	时间是有限资源， 总是不断在衰竭。
You either use it, or lose it.	你要么使用时间，要么失去时间。
"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.	就像本杰明·富兰克林说的那样，时间就是金钱。
And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation.	我想这句话对我们心理上产生的影响 是这样的影响——它创造出一个平衡式。
Time is scarce, so what do we do?	时间非常有限，所以我们怎么办？
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?	于是，我们就加速运转，不是么？
We try and do more and more with less and less time.	我们试着用更少的时间做更多的事。
We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line -- a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach, but a finish line nonetheless.	我们把每一天的每一刻 都变成向终点线的赛跑。 那一终点线，顺便说一句，我们却从未到达过， 但是那仍然还是一条终点线。
And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset?	那么我想问题是， 有没有可能从这一习惯性思维中跳出来？
And thankfully, the answer is yes, because what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.	还好，答案是有可能，因为 当我开始环顾四周，我发现，有一种 全球性的反抗力量存在，反抗这种高速度文化 这种高速度文化告诉我们越快越好，而且越忙越好。
Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable: they're slowing down, and finding that, although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill, the opposite turns out to be true: that by slowing down at the right moments, people find that they do everything better.	在全世界，有人做着意想不到的事： 他们放慢节奏，而且发现 尽管习惯思维告诉你，假如你放慢节奏，就会被时代潮流抛弃， 而事实上结果却相反。 在合适的时候放慢节奏， 人们发现他们做什么都做得更好。
They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better; they work better; they live better.	他们吃得更好，性生活更和谐，锻炼效果更好， 他们工作更棒，生活得也更好。
And, in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration, lie what a lot of people now refer to as the "International Slow Movement."	而在这些时刻，这些地方， 这些减速的行动中， 就存在着许多人所说的 国际慢活运动。
Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement.	现在，假如你允许我言行小小的不一致， 我将为你快速的概括一下—— 慢活运动中人们正在做些什么。
If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.	若你们关心吃食， 那你们中许多人应该听过慢食运动。
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries.	这场运动开始于意大利，但已传遍全世界， 并且现在已经有100,000成员 遍布50个国家。
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.	而且这场运动只是被一个非常简单和明智的信条所驱使， 那就是，当我们以不紧不慢的速度种植、烹饪还有食用食物的时候， 我们从食物当中， 将获得更多快乐和健康
I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable.	我认为有机农业运动的 蓬勃发展，以及农场主市场的复兴， 也体现出 人们非常想从 享用、烹饪食物以及种植食物的工业化方式 中逃离出来。
They want to get back to slower rhythms.	他们想要慢些的节奏。
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy, but has spread right across Europe and beyond.	而从慢食运动中产生了 被称之为慢活城市的运动，从意大利开始 却已经传遍欧洲和其它地方。
And in this, towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape, so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another.	而在这一运动中，城市 开始重新考虑如何规划城市景观， 能鼓励人们去——去放慢节奏 去闻闻玫瑰花，而且相互交流。
So they might curb traffic, or put in a park bench, or some green space.	所以他们可能会交通， 或是放置公园长椅，或是设置一些绿地面积。
And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts, because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City, it's kind of like a philosophical declaration.	某种程度上，这些改变能出现一加一大于二的效果。 当一座号召慢活的城市变成了一座真正意义上的慢速城市， 就有点像一种哲学理性上的宣言。
It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town, that we believe that in the 21st century, slowness has a role to play.	它是在向世界其它地区宣称，也是向那座城市的人民宣称， 宣称我们相信在21世纪， 慢速将发挥其作用。
In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick-fix mentality you find in conventional medicine.	在医疗方面，我想很多人都深感幻想破灭 对于你在传统医疗中存在的 那种速效治疗想法的幻灭。
And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine, which tend to tap into sort of slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.	因此全球数以百万的人转向 补充和替代形式的医疗， 这种医疗倾向于使用比较 慢一些，柔和一些，更全面的治疗形式。
Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies, and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.	现在，对于许多的补充性治疗方法，明显还没有最后定论， 且我个人怀疑咖啡灌肠法 也不会得到大众的认同。
But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation, clearly have some kind of benefit.	但是其他治疗方法 比如针灸和按摩，甚至只是放松法， 却明显的有一定好处。
And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work, and what we might learn from them.	且各处一流的医学院都正在 开始研究这些治疗方法，看它们如何产生效果， 以及我们能从这些方法中学到什么。
Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?	关于性，四处都有非常多快速的性关系，不是么？
I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there.	我打算去 好吧——我没想暗示什么
I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford, and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine, a men's magazine, and it said on the front, "How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."	我当时正往，这么说吧，慢慢的往牛津走， 然后我经过一个报刊亭，看到一本杂志， 一本男性杂志，在封面上写着， 如何在30秒内把你的伴侣带入性高潮。
So, you know, even sex is on a stopwatch these days.	你们看见了，就连性 现在也用计秒表数着时间了。
Now, you know, I like a quickie as much as the next person, but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.	现在 我差不多和其他人一样快速完事， 但我认为从缓慢的性生活中， 在卧室里放慢速度，我们能收获非常多。
You know, you tap into that -- those deeper, sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents, and you get a better orgasm with the buildup.	你利用这些更深层的， 有点儿心理的，情感的，精神的电流， 那么你会得到一个更棒的累积起来的性高潮。
You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.	让我们这么说吧，你可以为你的身体得到更大的快乐。
I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they, when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand."	我的意思是，指针姐妹合唱团把这个道理说得最动人，不是么， 她们为爱人缓慢游走的手唱赞歌。
Now, we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric, but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops, or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex.	几年前我们都嘲笑斯汀（歌手） 学习印度密宗性法（使缓慢持续）的事情 但是如果我们把时钟拨快几年，现在你会发现各个年龄层的夫妻 都去参加课程学习，或可能只是 在他们自己的卧室里寻找方法 来放缓步调，从而拥有更好的性生活。
And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure -- they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.	当然，在意大利，我是说，意大利人看起来总是知道 到哪去找乐子 他们已经开展了一场正式的慢速性生活运动。
The workplace.	在日常工作方面
Right across much of the world -- North America being a notable exception -- working hours have been coming down.	世界大部分地方的 工作时间都已经有所减少 不过北美明显是个例外。
And Europe is an example of that, and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less, and also that their hourly productivity goes up.	欧洲就是个减少工时的例子， 人们发现他们的生活质量上升了 随着工作时间的减少，工作时效也 提高了。
Now, clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in France -- too much, too soon, too rigid.	现在，很明显的，法国每周35小时 的工作时间存在问题 太多，太快，太死板。
But other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries, are showing that it's possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic.	但欧洲的其它国家，特别是在北欧国家， 事实表明无须工作成狂 也能拥有 一流的经济
And Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth, and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy.	挪威、瑞典、 丹麦以及芬兰现在 都位列世界六大最具竞争力的国家之列， 并且他们工作时间之短会使得一般的美国人 嫉妒得想哭。
And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought.	而假如你越过这种国家层次， 往下看微观，公司层次， 现在越来越多的公司意识到 他们有必要让员工 或者减少工作时间，或者离开工作在 午餐时间休息一下，或者坐在一个安静的房间里， 关掉他们的黑莓手机——说你呢，后面那个 手机， 这些在工作日或周末的休息让他们有时间去充电 有时间让大脑进入 那种创造性思维模式。
It's not just, though, these days, adults who overwork, though, is it?	然而，现在并不只是 成年人工作超负荷，不是么？
It's children, too.	小孩子也是。
I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s, and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework, more tutoring, more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.	我37岁，而我80年代中期才结束童年， 而现在我看着孩子们，看着他们赶着做 家庭作业，忙着补习 参加课外活动， 繁忙程度是我们这一代人从没想过的，我就感到很吃惊。
And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me to write to their parents, to help them slow down, to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill.	而我在我的网站上收到的最令人 痛心的邮件 事实上就是出自徘徊在疲劳殆尽边缘的青少年之手 他们恳求我 给他们的家长写信， 帮助他们放慢节奏，帮助他们摆脱 这超速的运转。
But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.	但也谢天谢地，也有一些父母在反思， 大家会发现，美国的城市 现在开始联合行动，在每个月特定的一天 禁止课外课程，这样人们就能， 就能释放压力，拥有家庭时间，以此放慢步调。
Homework is another thing.	家庭作业是另一回事。
There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, and now they're discovering that less can be more.	家庭作业禁令 在发达国家的学校非常普遍， 一些学校以前曾有家庭作业成堆的现象， 而现在他们发现作业数量少，质量可能更好。
So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of 13, and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said, "What are you -- you know, our kids will fall" -- the headmaster said, "No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."	因此，最近苏格兰出现一件实例 有一间苏格兰的高学费且高回报的私立学校 对13岁以下的学生 禁止布置家庭作业， 这让期望很高的父母吓了一跳并说， 你们在干什么，这样我们孩子的成绩会下降校长却说， 不会，不会，你们的孩子需要在放学后放松下来。
And just this last month, the exam results came in, and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent on average last year.	而就在上个月，考试成绩出来， 在数学，科学等课程上，分数上升了百分之二十 和去年平均成绩比。
And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much, are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling.	而我认为非常具有启发意义的是 进入一流大学常常是家长驱使孩子 努力学习的原因，而这些大学却发现 他们学生的素质正在下降。
These kids have wonderful marks; they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars, to the point that would make your eyes water.	 这些孩子拥有很棒的成绩， 他们的简历里写满了参加课外活动的经历， 多到会让你看了想哭的程度。
But they lack spark; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside -- they don't know how to dream.	然而他们却缺乏活力，他们缺乏 创造性思考和独立思考的能力 他们不知道如何想象。
And so what these Ivy League schools, and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.	因此，这些常春藤高校 以及牛津、剑桥等大学，开始向家长和学生们发出信息 表示家长学生们需要对此做出一些补救行动。
And in Harvard, for instance, they send out a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen -- telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard, if they put on the brakes, if they do less, but give time to things, the time that things need, to enjoy them, to savor them.	以哈佛大学为例，他们向 本科大一新生发出一封信 告诉他们，他们能从日常生活，从哈佛大学收获更多， 假如他们能减缓过于紧张的步调；假如他们能稍稍放松自己， 把时间放在那些有需要的事情上，给予那些事情足够的时间 好好享受，体味这些事情。
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all.	而有时候即使他们什么也不做（也能有很好的效果）。
And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think -- "Slow Down!"	我认为那封信的题目非常具有启发性，它叫 放慢速度！
-- with an exclamation mark on the end.	——以一个感叹号结尾。
So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same: that less is very often more, that slower is very often better.	所以不管你从哪个角度看，这一讯息，在我看来，都是一样的。
But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it?	 然而这样说，当然， 并不是说放慢速度那么容易，不是么？
I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness, and that's true, but that's not all of it.	我的意思是，当我正在写关于慢有何好处的书时 拿到一张超速罚单， 这是真的，而且事实还远不止这样
I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time.	那时候，我实际上是在前往 慢食俱乐部组织的一场晚宴途中。
And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.	如果这还不算丢脸的话，我还是在意大利拿的罚单。
And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway, you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.	如果你们中任何人曾在意大利高速公路上开过车的话， 你肯定知道我当时开得有多快。
But why is it so hard to slow down?	（观众大笑，因为意大利人开快车相当彪悍） 但是为什么放慢速度如此之难？
I think there are various reasons.	我认为原因有很多。
One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.	其一是速度快让人开心，你们知道的，速度快很性感。
It's all that adrenaline rush.	这都是肾上腺冲动造成的。
It's hard to give it up.	很难根除。
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions.	有一种哲学上的维度—— 在这种维度中，速度成为了把我们自身与 更大、更深层次问题隔离的壁垒。
We fill our head with distraction, with busyness, so that we don't have to ask, am I well?	我们脑子里充满着让我们分心和忙碌的事情， 使得我们不需要询问自己， 我还好么？
Am I happy?	我快乐么？
Are my children growing up right?	我的孩子这样成长的方式是正确的么？
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf?	政治家们的决定是否代表了我的利益？
Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason -- why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.	另一个原因我认为最强有力的原因也许是 之所以这么难慢下来，是源自文化中的一种行为定式 我们树立起的文化不允许我们慢下来。
"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.	缓慢在我们的文化中是个贬义词。
It's a byword for "lazy," "slacker," for being somebody who gives up.	它是懒，懒虫的代名词， 是用来说那些做事容易放弃的人的。
You know, "he's a bit slow."	他有一点慢。
It's actually synonymous with being stupid.	实际上是说 这个人有点蠢。
I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement, or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, and to say that yes, sometimes slow is not the answer, that there is such a thing as "bad slow."	我想慢活运动的目的 或者说它的主要目标，事实上，就是去破除这种定式 是为了表明 有时候该死的慢的原因 并不是在于慢本身
You know, I got stuck on the M25, which is a ring road around London, recently, and spent three-and-a-half hours there.	我最近有一次被困在 伦敦的M25环线公路上， 而且在那里困了三个半小时。
And I can tell you, that's really bad slow.	我可以告诉你， 那才是真正的该死的慢
But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too.	但从另一个角度看 慢活运动所包含的有点颠覆性质的思想 是说，有一种慢是积极的慢。
And good slow is, you know, taking the time to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.	积极的慢就是花些时间 和家人吃饭，没有电视机在旁边干扰。
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work.	或者是在办公室里花些时间把事情进行全面地梳理 从而做出最明智的决定 这是从工作角度来说。
Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life.	又或者只是花些时间 慢下来 品味生活。
Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out, is the reaction to it.	我发现自《慢活》一书出版以来 在所有发生的事情中，最令人振奋的 就是人们对这本书的反应。
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, by the corporate world -- you know, business press, but also big companies and leadership organizations.	我料想到，当这本关于慢活的书面市， 它会受到新生代的欢迎， 然而，它也同样被商界 津津乐道。不止那种 商业出版社，另外还有 大公司和组织的领导阶层的接纳。
Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.	因为像在座各位，处于领导链顶端的人，我想 他们开始意识到，在系统中 高速运作得有点过头了， 工作过于忙碌，是时候找回 那种已经遗失的慢速换挡艺术。
Another encouraging sign, I think, is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up.	我觉得另一个令人鼓舞的现象 是不止在发达国家 人们开始接纳这种思想。
In the developing world, in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status -- China, Brazil, Thailand, Poland, and so on -- these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, many people in them, and there's a debate going on in their media, on the streets.	在发展中国家中， 那些即将跨入 第一世界之列的国家——中国，巴西， 泰国、波兰以及其它一些国家 它们已经开始接受慢活运动的观点， 在媒体上，在大街小巷 也有关于此观点的争论。
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, "Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that."	因为他们关注着西方世界，他们认为， 嗯，我们对你们在这方面的观点很感兴趣， 但我们不很确定是不是真的可能。
So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible?	他们所说的这些，确实如此， 这是可能的么？
That's really the main question before us today.	这确实是如今摆在我们面前的主要问题。
Is it possible to slow down?	是否可能 放慢速度？
And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes.	 我很高兴我可以告诉你说 这个答案是，完全可能。
And I present myself as Exhibit A, a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic.	我自己就是一个实证 一个改过自新并且恢复正常的 曾经的速度狂人。
I still love speed.	我仍然喜欢快速。
You know, I live in London, and I work as a journalist, and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness, and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.	我住在伦敦， 而且是个记者， 喜欢忙忙碌碌， 喜欢由此产生的肾上腺素的刺激。
I play squash and ice hockey, two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.	我玩壁球，也玩冰球， 这两种都是非常讲究速度的运动，我绝不会放弃这两种运动。
But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise.	但是在过去的一年多，我 与我内心的慢龟龟进行了交流
And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously.	那意味着 我不去，我不再去 无缘无故的弄得自己负荷过重。
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic.	我的默认模式不再是 做一个大忙人。
I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before.	我再 也听不到时间高速战车催促迫近的声音， 至少不再像以前我感觉到的那么多。
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.	我现在能听到这种时间催促的声音，因为我看到演讲时间分分秒秒过去。
And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier, healthier, more productive than I ever have.	而所有这些的重点结论是 比起从前的我，我真的感到更快乐，更健康， 更有效率了。
I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it.	我觉得我在享受 我的人生，而不是在匆忙度日。
And perhaps, the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper, richer, stronger.	也许，最重要的 衡量慢活成功的标志是 我感觉到和他人的关系更密切 感情更深了，联系更强了。
And for me, I guess, the litmus test for whether this would work, and what it would mean, was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where the journey began.	对我而言，我想衡量这种方式 是否产生作用，以及它的意义最直接的方法 还是要回到我给儿子说睡前故事的事，因为那是这个事情 的开端。
And there too the news is rosy.	而这个结果 很美好。
You know, at the end of the day, I go into my son's room.	 晚上，我走进儿子的卧室。
I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer, so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket, and I just slow down to his pace and we read.	没戴表，关上了电脑， 这样我就听不见有新电子邮件到达的震动声， 我按着儿子的速度慢下来，我们一起阅读。
And because children have their own tempo and internal clock, they don't do quality time, where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.	因为孩子们有自己的节奏和生物钟， 他们不管父母们计划的家庭时间 你计划10分钟让他们对你打开心怀。
They need you to move at their rhythm.	而他们却要你跟着他们的节奏来行动。
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, my son will suddenly say, "You know, something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."	10分钟进入了故事状态， 而我儿子却会忽然说，你知道吗， 今天在操场上发生了些事情，真让我烦恼。
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.	然后我们就会不讲故事了，转而说说运动场发生了什么。
And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded, because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.	而我现在发现 它曾经只是一种 一项例行公事，成为我负担的睡前故事 这件耗时得让我想赶快完成它的睡前故事
It's become my reward at the end of the day, something I really cherish.	现在变成了在一天结束时对我的奖励， 成为了我真的，真的很珍惜的事情。
And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon, which goes a little bit like this: a few months ago, I was getting ready to go on another book tour, and I had my bags packed.	我打算用一个好莱坞电影式的故事 结束我今天下午的演讲 大致是这样的： 几个月之前，我准备进行 新一轮新书外地宣传，行李都已经收拾好了。
I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi, and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.	我就在楼下门口等计程车， 这时我儿子走下楼， 他正拿着为我做的一张卡片。
He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together, and put a sticker of his favorite character, Tintin, on the front.	他把两张卡片钉在一块，就像这些， 而且贴了他最喜欢的人物贴纸 丁丁（漫画人物，职业是记者）在卡片上。
And he said to me, or he handed this to me, and I read it, and it said, "To Daddy, love Benjamin."	接着他对我说， 或者这么说，他把卡片递给我，接着我读到， 卡片上写着，致爸爸，爱你的本杰明。
And I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.	我就想说，啊，这真是太棒了，
Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"	这是不是一张祝我外出顺利的好运卡呢？
And he said, "No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card for being the best story reader in the world."	然而他说，不，不是，不是，爸爸，这是一张 送给世界上故事讲得最好的人的卡片。
And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."	接着我想，看来放慢速度真他奶奶的管用啊。。。
Thank you very much.	非常感谢在座各位。
I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development.	我是一个营销改革家 我现在致力于国际拓展
In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the [second] largest country in Africa.	今年10月份，我在刚果民主共和国待了一段时间 它是非洲第二大的国家
In fact, it's as large as Western Europe, but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.	国土面积和西欧差不多 却只有300英里柏油路
The DRC is a dangerous place.	那是个危险的地方
In the past 10 years, five million people have died due to a war in the east.	近十年里，东部地区有500万人 死于战争
But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC.	但是战争不是当地人 生活艰难的唯一原因
There are many health issues as well.	还有许多健康原因
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults.	事实上，艾滋病在成人中的 患病率为1.3%
This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million people, it means there are 930,000 that are infected.	这听起来不是一个很大的比率 但在一个仅有7600万人的国家 就意味着93万人被感染
And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.	加之基础设施又非常落后 因此只有25%的患者 可以获得所需的药物
Which is why, in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost.	这也是为什么 部分捐赠机构提供免费或低价的 避孕套
And so while I was in the DRC, I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including Damien.	因此我在那里的时候 花了大量时间和人们讨论避孕套的话题 包括和达米安
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.	达米安在金沙萨外经营着一家酒店
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay.	它只营业到午夜 因此它不是一个过夜的地方
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.	但却是性工作者和其客户光顾的地方
Now Damien knows all about condoms, but he doesn't sell them.	达米安很了解避孕套 却不销售
He said there's just not in demand.	他说因为没什么需求
It's not surprising, because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms.	这并不奇怪 因为只有3%的当地人使用 避孕套
Joseph and Christine, who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost, and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them, their customers don't buy the branded versions.	约瑟夫和克莉丝汀 经营着一家药房并且销售避孕套 他们说尽管捐赠机构提供免费或者价低价的避孕套 同时还进行宣传活动 但是他们的客户却不买有商标的
They like the generics.	他们喜欢没有品牌的
And as a marketer, I found that curious.	作为一名营销人员我对此很好奇
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.	因此我开始对营销进行观察
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms: fear, financing and fidelity.	捐助机构在宣传他们的避孕套的时候 遵循三条主旨思想 恐惧，经济，忠诚
They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live" or Trust.	他们给避孕套起类似有活力的之类的名字 或信任
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently.	他们用红丝带包装 警示我们艾滋病毒 把它放入这样的盒子中提醒你这是谁捐赠的 配有妻子或者丈夫的照片 告诉你要保护他们 或保持谨慎
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom.	这些事情可不是一个人去买避孕套之前 所想的事情
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom?	那你们在得到避孕套前 都在想什么呢？
Sex!	性！
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places, they understand this.	在这些地区销售避孕套的私营公司 他们深知这一点
Their marketing is slightly different.	他们的营销策略稍有不同
The name might not be much different, but the imagery sure is.	名称也许没有太多不同 但是图标却不同
Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.	有些牌子目标远大 同时包装设计极富煽动性
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing: understanding who's the audience.	这就启发我思考 也许捐助机构恰恰没抓住 营销学上的一个要点： 了解谁是你的客户
And for donor agencies, unfortunately, the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working [in].	遗憾的是，对于捐助机构来说 他们的客户 不是他们现在工作所在国的这些人
It's people back home, people that support their work, people like these.	是在后方的人 是赞助他们的人 是这些人们
But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples, the young women, the young men -- whose lives depend on it.	但是如果我们真正要做的 是阻止艾滋病的传播 那么我们就要考虑到客户 考虑到那些需要改变其行为的人-- 夫妻 年轻妇女，青年男子-- 考虑到那些以此为生的人
And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.	因此关键在于： 你卖的是什么东西并不重要 你要考虑的是谁是你的客户群 以及让他们做出改变 的原因是什么
It might just save their lives.	也许这样就能挽救他们的生命了。
Thank you.	谢谢

There are important distributional consequences, and they're not what you always might think.	这里有很多重大的次生结果 并且可能与你一直所想的大相径庭。
In New Orleans, the elderly and female-headed households were among the most vulnerable.	在新奥尔兰，老年人和需要支撑起整个家庭的主妇们 是最脆弱的。
For those in vulnerable, low-lying nations, how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried?	对于那些脆弱，无依无靠的人， 你怎能等同一美元和失去你的国家 那你祖先所居住的地方？
And where will your people go?	而且你又能去哪儿呢？
And how will they cope in a foreign land?	再之他们又怎么适应新的地方？
Will there be tensions over immigration, or conflicts over competition for limited resources?	他们是否会因为移民而焦虑， 又或为了争夺匮乏的资源而争吵？
It's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur.	这已曾在乍得共和国和苏尔富尔（位于苏丹，译者注）引起过冲突
Like it or not, ready or not, this is our future.	喜欢或不喜欢，准备好了或是没有，这 就是我们的未来。
Sure, some are looking for opportunities in this new world.	是的，有人在寻找新世界的机遇。
That's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice.	那是俄罗斯在海底插上他们的国旗 去申明矿物所有权，在北极渐渐退去的冰底中
But while there might be some short-term individual winners, our collective losses will far outweigh them.	但是当这可能会有一些短期获利的同时 我们累计起的损失会远远超过这些。
Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events.	不要舍近求远，就像保险行业挣扎着 去赔偿灾难的损失 来源于恶劣的天气环境。
The military gets it. They call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security, while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond.	军队懂得了，他们把气候改变称为 一个威胁倍增器，它们可以威胁稳定和安全， 正当全世界的政府正在评估 如何去回应的时候。
So what can we do?	所以，我们能做什么？
How can we prepare and adapt?	我们如何准备并去适应？
I'd like to share three sets of examples, starting with adapting to violent storms and floods.	我想分享三个例子，开始于 适应猛烈的暴风雨和洪水。
In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans, with sections knocked out in Katrina, have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge.	在新奥尔南，1-10双拱桥 因其中一个被击垮，已经重建 高21码去适应更猛烈的浪潮。
And these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right for the hard-hit Ninth Ward.	和这些建得更高且高能效的房屋 是布拉特皮特和使它变得更好组织建立 为了有九级防御功能
The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher, it's poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country.	这个被摧毁了的教堂是我母亲过去常去的一个 不仅仅被建得更高了，而且还被建成了 这个国家的第一个一星能源教堂。
They're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels, reflective paint and more.	它们运输电源到输电网 基于太阳能面板和反光漆油以及其余东西。
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars.	他们二月份的电费仅仅是48美金。
Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way, but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind.	现在这些是新奥尔南重建过程中的案例们 但是如果别人能够提前设想这些措施就更好了。
For example, in Galveston, here's a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike, when others on neighboring lots clearly did not.	举个例子，在加尔维斯顿有一个弹性结构房 从飓风中得以幸存 当它周围的建筑都很明显被摧毁殆尽。
And around the world, satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh.	与此同时在世界各地，卫星和报警系统 正在从像孟加拉国这样的低洼地区拯救生命
But as important as technology and infrastructure are, perhaps the human element is even more critical.	但是就像技术和基础设施一样重要 人为因素可能更为重要。
We need better planning and systems for evacuation.	我们需要更好的疏散计划和系统。
We need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis, and why.	我们需要透彻地理解人们如何做决定 当他们面临危机时刻，而且为什么。
While it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation, others who did refused to leave as the storm approached, often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets.	虽然真相是很多凯瑟琳台风遇害者都未能使用交通工具 而有机会使用交通工具的却在暴风雨来临时拒绝离开 常常是因为可使用的交通工具和避难所 都拒绝允许他们带上自己的宠物
Imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue.	想象一下无法撤离和营救你自己的宠物。
Fortunately in 2006, Congress passed the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act — it spells "PETS" — to change that.	但幸运的是在2006年，国会通过了 宠物撤离及运输标准法案 －添上了宠物 －从而改变了之前的情形
Second, preparing for heat and drought.	第二点，为和高温和干旱做好准备
Farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia to Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma, while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in Western Europe in 2003, and again in Russia in 2010.	农民们正面临着旱灾的挑战，从亚洲 到非洲,从澳洲到俄克拉荷马州 与此同时高温热浪和气候变化紧紧相连 已经杀死了成千上万的人 在2003年在西欧，和2010年的俄罗斯。
In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0 percent of the population, depends on rainfall for its livelihood.	在埃塞俄比亚百分之七十，是百分之七－十的人口 依靠降雨来维持他们的生活。
Oxfam and Swiss Re, together with Rockefeller Foundation, are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water, but they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come.	牛津饥荒救济委员会和瑞士再保险公司与洛克菲勒基金会携手 共同帮助像他一样农民们建造山坡梯田 和找寻其余的方法保存用水 但当旱灾来临的时候他们也提供保险赔偿
The stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest.	这让那些农民坚定了 投资的信心。
It's giving them access to affordable credit.	向他们提供可负担的贷款。
It's allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time, without assistance.	这使他们变得更加多产 随着时间过去有能力自给自足，从而不需要赞助。
It's a virtuous cycle, and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world.	这是一个良性循环，而且是可以在 发展中国家广泛使用的。
After a lethal 1995 heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues, Chicago became a recognized leader, tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers, outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods, planting trees, creating cool white or vegetated green roofs.	在致命的1995热浪中 让冷藏车从芝加哥节日流行口味 变成了停尸房。 芝加哥变成了广为人知的领导者， 迈出了城市热岛效应 借助于开放避暑中心 到到脆弱的郊区，种植树木 建立凉爽的或者植物覆盖的屋顶。
This is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook County's [portion of the] roof, which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface.	这座市政厅的绿色屋顶， 较为内部温度，表面温度高77华氏度
Washington, D.C., last year, actually led the nation in new green roofs installed, and they're funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.	华盛顿在去年实际上带领了这个国家 建立绿色屋顶，而他们也通过 5分钱的塑料袋税收来为这项工程提供资金。
They're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners.	他们同时与家庭和建筑所有者 共同分担建设绿色屋顶的费用。
The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy, and therefore money, the emissions that cause climate change, and they also reduce stormwater runoff.	这种屋顶不仅能调节城市热岛效应 同时还能节约能源，金钱 以及减少温室气体 同时也能起到排水效果。
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins.	因此有些解决酷暑的手段能够带来双赢
Third, adapting to rising seas.	第三点，适应海平面上升
Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems, agriculture, even major cities.	海平面上升威胁沿海地区生态，农业系统 甚至主要城市。
This is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta.	这是一 两米左右 海平面上升在湄公河看起来的样子
That's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown.	那里是越南一半粮食的产地。
Infrastructure is going to be affected.	基础设施将会被影响。
Airports around the world are located on the coast.	通往全世界的机场就建立在这里
It makes sense, right?	这很合理，对吧？
There's open space, the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings.	因为这里是一片空地 飞机可以起飞降落而不用担心 产生噪音或去躲避高楼大厦。
Here's just one example, San Francisco Airport, with 16 inches or more of flooding.	这里只是一个例子，旧金山机场， 受16英尺左右的洪水泛滥袭击。
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees.	想像一下用于保护 重要基础设施的堤坝的费用。
But there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine.	但是与此同时可能有 你不能预测的变化。
For example, planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated, less dense air, provides for less lift.	比如， 飞机需要更多的跑道去起飞， 因为高温，不稠密的空气，不能提供足够的升力。
San Francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment, as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater, causing backups at the plant, harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste.	旧金山还花费四千万美元 去反思和重建下水道处理系统。 因为像这样的排水渠口也可能被海水淹没， 从而危害植物，滋生细菌。 需要建立设施来处理这些浪费。
So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system.	因此需要更新这些排水管道 防止海水进入排水系统。
Beyond these technical solutions, our work at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change.	除了这些技术层面的措施意外，我们位于 乔治城气候中心和社区共同工作 鼓励他们参考现存的法律和政策 并且考虑如何才能适应变化。
For example, in land use, which areas do you want to protect, through adding a seawall, for example, alter, by raising buildings, or retreat from, to allow the migration of important natural systems, such as wetlands or beaches?	譬如，用地，哪片地区你想要 通过用建设防波堤的方式去保护，再比方 通过升高建筑，或向后搬迁 去允许重要的自然系统迁徙 比方说湿地或者沙滩？
Other examples to consider. In the U.K., the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge.	这里同时有其余的例子，在英国， 泰晤士河保护伦敦免遭于风暴潮袭击。
The Asian Cities Climate [Change] Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves.	亚洲城市气候变迁韧性组织 正在修复类似于红树林的重要的生态系统。
These are not only important ecosystems in their own right, but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities.	这些生态系统不仅仅是本身是重要的 而且同时充当了缓冲区的作用来保护内陆地区。
New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms, as you can see from this clever sign, and to sea level rise, and to storm surge, as you can see from the subway flooding.	纽约在暴风雨面前显得十分脆弱， 就想你在这块指示牌上看到的一样，纽约同时也经不住海平面上升 和暴风雨，正如你从这幅纽约地铁涨水图中看见的一样。
But back above ground, these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive.	但是当我们返回到地面，这些上升的地铁通风格栏 系统提醒我们措施可以同时 是有功能效应且引人注意的。
In fact, in New York, San Francisco and London, designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind.	事实上，纽约 旧金山和伦敦，设计师们已经设想出了 能更加契合自然并且 兼顾应对自然变化的建设方法。
I think these are inspiring examples of what's possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different.	我认为这些设想都是十分打动人心的例子 ，让我们认为自己有能力去改变这个世界。
But now, a word of caution.	但是现在，请谨记着
Adaptation's too important to be left to the experts.	对这些专家而言适应也是十分重要的。
Why?	为什么？
Well, there are no experts.	因为就没有所谓的专家。
We're entering uncharted territory, and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past.	我们正在进入一个全新的领域，而目前为止 我们的专长和系统都仅仅是建立于过去的。
"Stationarity" is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past, and plan accordingly, and this principle governs much of our engineering, our design of critical infrastructure, city water systems, building codes, even water rights and other legal precedents.	平稳是我们将使用于未来的准则 基于经验，同时随机应变， 与此同时，这也是一个领导我们当今工程 当今设计核心基础设施，城市排水系统， 建筑规范，甚至用水权以及其余判例的词。
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms.	但是我们在也不能仅仅依靠建立规范了。
We're operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years.	我们已经超如了地球上已经恪守了成千上万年 的二氧化碳浓度限制。
It's up to us to look at our homes and our communities, our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk, and to find ways to not just survive, but to thrive, and it's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same, even while they address the underlying causes of climate change.	 不仅仅是去找寻一个生存的办法，而是一个繁荣兴旺的办法。 而且这是我们的责任去规划和准备 和提醒我们的政府领导并且要求他们 去做同样的事，即便与此同时他们正在 强调潜伏的气候变化原因。
There are no quick fixes.	这没有权宜之计。
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.	这里没有完全之策。
We're all learning by doing.	我们只有从实践中学习。
But the operative word is doing.	关键词是做去，去实践。
Thank you.	谢谢。
I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire.	我将快速地展示三件作品
I don't have much time to do it.	我时间不多
And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.	并且我想通过快速的展示来强化这三件作品的概念
The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process.	第一件作品我将它的设计称之为高度理性主义
It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call, sort of, a rational conclusion to something.	它几乎 已经理性到了荒唐的境界 它已经超过了 人们通常可以接受的 理性的程度
And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.	它包含了一些你看得见 但却想不到是理性主义的 一些元素
The second -- the second is that this process does not have a signature.	第二件 这第二件作品 并没有署名
There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship.	我们不知作者是谁，而通常建筑师很乐于署名
This is something that has editing and it has teams.	通常以团队形式
In fact, we no longer see, within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out.	事实上我们在这件作品中看不到 传统建筑大师的创造 而只是他的助手画出的草图
And the third is that it challenges -- and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why, connect all these things -- but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility.	第三个，有点难度 以它的长度，很难把所有这些 连接在一起 但它挑战了最现代意义上的灵活性
High modernists said, we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic.	现代主义认为，我们创造 一种共有的单一空间
Almost anything can happen within them.	几乎所有的事都能在那里发生
I call it sort of "shotgun flexibility."	我把它称为射击的灵活性
And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to be the most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen.	一旦有了这种想法 所有正在建造中的 或者所有看似最急迫的需求 都会阻止想法的落实 以及最后设计成果的诞生
And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call "compartmentalized flexibility."	所以我们提出一种不一样的灵活性 我们称之为 分类的灵活性
And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them.	大致的概念就像 你连续地确认一系列点，并对它们进行设计
They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.	它们会有点偏离中心 但最后你还是会得到 和你最初想要的类似的效果
With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.	而现代主义的灵活性，这点却不能成立
Now I'm going to talk about -- I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see.	现在我来谈一下，我打算建造西雅图中央图书馆 你们可以看到五六个图表 这就是你们将看到的设计过程
With the library staff and the library board, we settled on two core positions.	我们同图书馆委员会及工作人员一起 确定了两个核心设置
This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book and other technologies.	这是第一个，它显示了，在过去900年里， 书和其他技术的进化过程
This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book, and our position was, books are technology -- that's something people forget -- but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media.	这图代表了我们对书的定位 书本就是技术 许多人忘了这点 但是我们需要借助其他技术或媒介 才能分享书的影响力
The second premise -- and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -- is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles.	第二个预设，这个很难， 我们花了很大力气去说服图书管理员 它们自从 美国卡耐基图书馆的传统开始 就承担了一种第二性的社会责任
OK, now, this I'll come back to later, but something, actually, the librarians at first said, "No, this isn't our mandate.	好了，现在，我们稍候再说这个，但是 那些图书管理员一开始会说：不，这不是我们要管的
Our mandate is media, and particularly the book."	我们管的是媒介，尤其是书
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.	所以你现在看到的其实是建筑的设计
The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.	上面的图表 是我们在整个当代图书馆里看到的 它们运用到了现代主义的灵活性
Sort of, any activity could happen anywhere.	就是那种，任何事在任何地方都可能发生的
We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book; and so we'll use this approach.	我们不知道图书馆的未来，也不知道书的未来 所以我们用这个方法
And what we saw were buildings that were very generic.	我们看到的建筑千人一面
And, worse, not only did we see buildings that were very generic -- so, not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area -- but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it.	更糟的是并不只是看上去非常相似 不只是阅览室和文印室 或者和杂志区长得差不多 更重要的是它意味着 所有图书馆里发生的事 都会相互干扰相互影响
And in this case, what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book.	在这种情况下 书的社会责任之延伸将得不到发挥
And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram.	所以我们提出了下面的这个图
Very dumb approach: simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict -- and I don't mean that we could say whatever would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrum of whatever would happen in the future -- put those in boxes designed specifically for it, and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops.	很土的办法 简化分类，将这些我们可以预料的事 我并不是说我们可以预测未来发生什么 但是我们很确信有这种 未来发生的可能性 把这些东西放在一个专门设计的盒子里 而把那些无法预测的放在屋顶
So that was the core idea.	这就是核心思想
Now, we had to convince the library that social roles was equally important to media in order to get them to accept this.	现在，为了让图书管理员认识到这一点 我们必须说服他们 社会责任和媒介的作用一样重要
What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.	你现在看到的左边的是他们的程序
That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory.	和我们拿到它时一样的色彩鲜艳
Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, "You know what?	我们的第一步是重新组合它们 回去跟他们说 你们知道吗，我们一点都没动过 但你们的程序只有1/3是和媒介及书有关的
So, once we had presented that back to them, they agreed that this sort of core concept could work.	所以，一旦我们把这个重新给他们看 他们同意这种核心概念能有效
We got the right to go back to first principles -- that's the third diagram. We recombined everything.	我们可以回到最重要的 第三个图表，我们把一切重新组合
And then we started making new decisions.	然后我们开始做新的决定
What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage.	你们看到的右边是对图书馆的设计 尤其是面积空间上
On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs, collective programs.	左边，这里 你会看见 一系列的五个平台 梳理整合好的程序
And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict.	而右边不确定的空间 比如阅览室 我们无法判断它未来20，30，40年的发展
So that literally was the design of the building.	所以这就是初步的设计
They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this.	他们签字同意了，但让他们懊恼的是 一个星期以后，我们回来，向他们展示了这个
OK? And, as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.	你可以看到，这和那个图表面上看很契合
OK? We just sized -- no, really, I mean that, literally.	我们只是 噢，我说真的，表面上看
The things on the -- on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes.	左边这些 就像图上的，是盒子
We sized them into five compartments.	我们把他们放进了五个部分
They're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with.	超级高效，我们预算很低
We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships.	我们就这样建造 非常清楚的上下关系
The reading room should be able to see the water.	从阅览室里可以看到下面的水
The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.	主入口前有一个广场 遵守区域编号，排列
So, you see the five platforms -- those are the boxes -- within each one a very discrete thing is happening.	你可以看到五个平台 五个盒子，每个专供一项特殊的用途
The area in between is sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree.	而中间是现代化的联结 这些我们无法预料未来发展进度的
It just so happens to be in the sixth through 10th floor of the building, but that is not necessarily an expensive approach.	从6楼到10楼 但并不贵
And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey decimal system on one continuous run: no matter how it grows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries.	它使得我们可以连续地使用杜威十进制图书排列法 无论书的数量怎样扩张 还是可以整理得很清楚 我们以前都曾对公共图书馆很无语 经常找不到书
And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin.	而最后一步就是把这些楼层 整合在一起 设计一个漂亮的外观
That skin serves double duty, again for economics.	这个外观必须有两层作用
One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building; it is a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure, but also for holding on every piece of glass.	第一，维持整个建筑横向的稳定 这是结构层面的，但它的作用不仅在于此 它还必须保证所有玻璃的安装
The glass was then -- I'll just use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metal that was called "stressed metal."	使得玻璃融合一体 但它有所谓的一层受力金属
That metal acts as a micro louver, so from the exterior of the building the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior it's entirely transparent.	就像微型天窗 隔离外部的阳光 却能保持室内光线通透
So, now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building.	现在，我将带你们领略一下这个建筑
Let's see if I can find it. For anyone who is -- gets motion sickness, I apologize.	我来找找看 抱歉
So this is the building.	这就是那幢建筑
And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building, the public thought -- saw it as being totally about our whim and ego.	我认为重要的是，当我们首次展示这个建筑 公众普遍认为 这只是我们一时的野心和兴致
And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians. They said, "Look, we don't know what it is, but we know it's everything that we need it to be based on the observations that we've done about the program."	但信不信由你们，这个建筑得到了图书管理员们的拥护 他们说：我们不知这是啥， 但根据我们观察 它有了我们需要的一切
This is going into one of the entries.	这是个入口
So it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.	这是个很特别的公共图书馆 很显然
So now we're going into what we call the reading room -- sorry, living room.	我们去看一下阅览室，错了，是大厅
This is actually a program that we invented with the library.	这其实是我们发明的一个空间
It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space.	将图书馆作为 一个公众的自由空间
There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain.	在西雅图市中心 有许多购物广场，你避雨的时候可以去 但却没有多少 自由空间让你避雨
So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell, play chess and so forth.	而这就是一个人们可以做很多事的空间 包括吃，叫喊，下棋等等
Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber.	现在我们往上 这是一个混合区
That was the main sort of technology area in the building.	也是整座建筑的主体
You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you.	如果我走得太快，你们可以提出
Now up.	现在上来
This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife. Right there.	这个其实是我们特地设计的 好让我向我妻子求婚，就是这里
She said yes.	她答应了
I'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop.	我快没时间了，所以就此打住
I can show this to you later.	我可以晚些再向你们展示
But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral, because I think it's, as I said, the most -- this is the main reading room -- the most unique part of the building.	但我们试试看能不能快点看一下书螺旋 因为我觉得它是最…… 这是主阅览室，书螺旋是整座建筑最独特的地方
You dizzy yet?	你们晕了吗？
OK, so here, this is the book spiral.	好，这就是书螺旋
So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually a continuous stair stepping.	看不清 但实际上它是不断在上升
It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.	让你在一层楼 不断连续地向上
OK, now I'm going to go back, and so I'm going to hit a second project.	好，现在我们谈谈第二个作品
I'm going to go very, very quickly through this.	我会很快
Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said, "We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company.	这是达拉斯剧院，我们一个很特别的客户 因为他们来找我们，说 我们需要你们建一栋新楼 我们已经在临时房里工作了30年 就是因为那临时房 我们的剧院公司臭名昭著
Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company."	我们的剧院主要针对纽约，芝加哥，西雅图 这是我们达拉斯剧院公司的一些期望
And the very fact that they worked on a provisional space meant that for Beckett they could blow out a wall; they could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.	而他们在临时性场地工作的事实 说明他们可以随便弄垮一面墙 或者像樱桃园一样在地上挖洞，等等
So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could keep the -- be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature.	所以要为他们造一幢新楼对我们是一项令人畏惧的工作 要保持完好无损的外表 又要允许他们在里面做各种试验性的事
And the second is, they were what we call a multi-form theater: they do different kinds of performances in repertory.	第二点是，这家公司是我们常说的 多功能剧院 他们安排各种剧目的表演
So they in the morning will do something in arena, then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.	比如早上， 他们会安排竞技场表演 然后还有些幕前表演等等
And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the United States, so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.	所以他们需要很快地 在各种剧目间转换 而由于预算 现在一般的美国剧院公司 都不做这种形式 因此我们要想法克服这一点
So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head: to take those things that were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them -- above house and below house -- and to create sort of what we started to call a theater machine.	所以我们的想法是把剧院放在前面 然后把前面说的这些分为前部和后部 以及上部和下部 把它建成一个剧院机器
We invest the money in the operation of the building.	我们投钱进去
It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere: wherever you place it, the area underneath it is charged for theatrical performances.	所有的钱都会通过剧院的演出 得到回报
And it allowed us to go back to first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.	这让我们回到最初 重新设计舞台塔，音箱 灯光等
And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium thrust and, in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor in a very quick transfiguration.	同时，只要一按键 艺术导演就可以在舞台，竞技场 之间穿梭 这是一种很快的转换
So in fact, we can go, using operational budget, we can -- sorry, capital cost -- we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost.	所以事实上，用那些运营成本 抱歉，是资本成本，我们可以达到 难以置信的效果
This is the theater up close.	这就是剧院
Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely.	其实周围的每一部分都可以秘密打开
The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.	照明可以分开 这些都拿掉你可以演贝克纳 把达拉斯作为背景
Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance, or you can even just have an open-air performance, or for intermissions.	周围打开，你可以让摩托车进去 直接上舞台，甚至可以由开放式的表演 或者是便于转场
The balconies all move to go between those configurations, but they also disappear.	这些结构中的所有包厢都可以移动 或者拿掉
The proscenium line can also disappear.	幕前部分也可以拿掉
You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact their -- the Dallas Theater Company -- their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in [a] real aircraft.	你可以搬来巨大的东西，事实上 达拉斯剧院的第一场秀 是关于查尔斯·林德伯格的 他们将搬来真的飞行器
And at night.	这是在晚上
Again, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure.	一样的，去掉灯光，保留声音
This is a monster truck show.	可以演鬼片
I'm going to show now the last project.	现在我将要展示最后一件作品
This also is an unusual client.	也是一个特别的客户
They inverted the whole idea of development.	他们颠覆了整个发展的思路
They came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said, "We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal."	和一般的开发商不同，他们过来跟我们说 我们想从 当代艺术馆开始 在路易斯维尔，这就是我们主要的目标
And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown.	和一般开发商看到赚钱的机会不同 他们希望在市中心 制造一些刺激因素
And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse.	他们建立起一种预期 来支持当代艺术 并且为此奋斗
And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate, interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within.	而那种预期 引导我们建造一幢很大的多功能建筑 可以支持他们的艺术灵感 同时为艺术本身提供机会 与商业空间整合，互动 这才是现代艺术家期望的工作环境
And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building.	这也迫使我们去思考 如何把两种功能 融合在一幢建筑里
So now I'm going to -- this is Louisville's skyline -- and I'm going to take you through various constraints that led to the project.	现在我将，这是路易斯维尔的地平线 我将带你们穿过 各种各样的限制去看到这个项目
First: the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well, well smaller than the size of the building.	首先，空间上的限制 事实上我们要在三个分散的点之间建造 而它们在体积上都比这建筑小
We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali center, and respect it.	首先，是新的爱立中心 我们必须在风格上与它协调
We had to operate within the 100-year floodplain.	必须建造在100年漫滩的范围内
Now, this area floods three to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans.	现在这块地方，每三到四年犯一次洪水 我们选址的后面还有一码头 和新奥尔良损坏的那个很相似
Have to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.	我们必须在I-64长廊后施工 这条街把地分割成几部分
So these -- we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.	所有的这些…… 简直是灾难
Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines.	这块地下面 有城市的主要电线
And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings, and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building.	他们想在那里建一条徒步走廊 可以将周围的建筑连成一体 同时这也是一条景观走道 由于这是历史区，他们不希望被新房子挡住
And now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet.	现在我们将扩建1100万平方英尺
And if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet -- these are the different programs -- the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a really terrible situation: a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods.	如果我们按常规做法 当然这个项目会有不同 传统的做法就是识别一些公共元素，保持不动 这样就会有一个很糟的结果 会出现整体和谐中的突兀
And then we would size all the other elements -- the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth -- and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable.	然后我们会安排其他的一些元素 一些商业元素 酒店，奢侈住房，办公楼等 这些建筑会在上层 我们的这些建筑无法独立存在
In fact -- and you know this -- this is called the Time Warner building.	事实上，就像时代华纳大楼
So our strategy was very simple.	我们的战略非常简单
Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections and reroute the road.	把整个街区向上提升 把一些建筑重新组合 使它们看起来更协调，关系更紧密 改变建筑间的关系以及道路的排列
So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.	好了，这是基本的概念 现在我想你们展示它的效果
OK, it seems a very formal, willful gesture, but something derived entirely out of the constraints.	好的，它看上去是一个有力的象征 完全超出一般的限制
And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement, not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems.	一样的是，当它被揭幕时，也面临了种种质疑 这就像建筑师作了一个声明 却不去解决问题 有一系列的问题
Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix a series of things.	现在，正如我说的，我们有能力 在那片中心区域组合一系列的事
So here you can see that these -- this -- sort of an x-ray -- the towers are totally developer-driven. They told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all the public components -- the lobbies, the bars, everything that the different commercial elements would have -- and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.	所以你们可以看到这些 这些，这塔就像x射线 这些都是由发展商决定的，他们告诉我们面积的标准 而我们主要关注公共元素 大厅，酒吧， 所有关于商业的 并把他们在中心整合，就像四通八达的地铁图 在过渡区域由当代博物馆
So it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close.	所以大致就是这个样子 我们有艺术家在里面工作 22楼的艺术空间有惊人的视野 但是馆长可以选择 是否开放这一区域
It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art, and so forth.	人们可以在那里骑自行车锻炼 观赏艺术，或成为艺术的一部分等
It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool, so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space.	如果有的艺术家很想尝试游泳池这样的空间 在这里他们可以在游泳池内进行展览 这与一般的当代艺术相比 使他们不用再恪守固定的局限
So, how to build this.	所以，怎么造这个
This is not a high-budget building.	这幢建筑预算并不高
The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air.	当主体物分建到中层时 艺术博物馆封顶，开始安装机械设备 然后在这里建个平面
This is how they build really large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones that they did for the A380.	他们也是这样造大型飞机库的 比如他们为空客A380早的
Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something that looks like this.	主体框架搭建完成后开始填充血肉 然后你们可以看到就像这个
Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that. Thank you.	现在我大概只有30秒，我马上开始 一个动画片，我们将以此结束
Chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction, and this project will start construction in about a year, and finish in 2010.	掌声 Chris希望我加几句 剧院正在建造 而这个工程将在大约一年后开工 2010年完工
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point where I get this thing to work.	十八分钟是一个非常紧的时间限制， 因此我直入主题，讲重点的， 我将马上开始。
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.	好，我要谈五个不同的事情。
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.	一，我要谈谈为什么抗老化是可行的。
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.	二，我要谈谈为什么我们必须打起精神， 多讨论这个课题，并且发觉我们应该指望战胜老化。
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.	当然，三，我也会谈谈战胜老化的可行性。
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging.	四，我要谈谈为什么我们在人类抗老化上采取的行动这么的认命， 以为都是注定的。
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it.	然后，第五，我也许在这个节目的下半段的时间谈谈 我们如何证明这个[对战胜老化]漠不关心以及以为是注定的心态是错误的， 并且实际上做点什么事来纠正这个错误。
I'm going to do that in two steps.	这第五点，我会用两个步骤来谈论。
The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.	第一个步骤是 如何从一个相对适中的延长寿命治疗科技 - 我这就把它定义为可延长三十年寿命， 并且在已经是中年年龄的人开始应用 – 直到一个能真正被称为战胜老化问题的程度。
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed, to get sick in the first place.	也就是说，实质上消除了你多大年纪， 以及你在下一年死去或 生病的可能性之间的关系。
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years life extension.	最后一件事[第五件事情， 第二个步骤]我要谈的是如何实现过度步骤， 那个能给我们每一个人延长三十年寿命的治疗科技。
So I'm going to start with why we should.	好，我就从为什么要延长人类的寿命开始。
Now, I want to ask a question.	现在，我想问一个问题。
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?	观众席里有谁赞成疟疾是有利的？
OK.	好，这很简单。
OK.	行。行。
Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?	请不知道疟疾 是好事还是坏事的人举手？
OK.	好。
So we all think malaria is a bad thing.	所以，我们都认为，疟疾是一件坏事。
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.	这是一个非常好的消息，因为我原以为这就是答案。
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.	现在我希望你们想一想 我们认为疟疾是一件坏事主要的原因， 是因为疟疾和老化有着共同的特征。
And here is that characteristic.	那个特征就是两者都杀死人。
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.	唯一真正的区别是，老龄化杀死的人数比疟疾杀死的多许多。
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially, to talk about the comparison with foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle, by the government not very many months ago.	现在，我喜欢观众，尤其是在英国的观众， 比较一下老化和打猎狐狸。 打猎狐狸是是经过长期斗争 不久前被政府禁止的活动。
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.	我的意思是，虽然我知道富有同情心的观众应该大多数都反对打猎狐狸， 但我们知道，很多人并不是完全被这个逻辑说服。
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.	在我看来，这其实和老化是一个不错的比较。
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know, city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.	你知道，很多[郊外]的人说：你们这些 住在城市的人没有权利告诉我们什么活动可以做什么东西不能做。
It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.	这是我们[住在郊外的人]的传统生活方式的一部分， 我们应该有权力继续做它。
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."	这是促进生态健全的，它控制了狐狸数量爆涨。
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end, because the majority of the British public, and certainly the majority of members of Parliament, came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.	但是，政府最终占了上风， 因为大多数的英国公众， 还有国会多数成员， 得出的结论，就是这[打猎狐狸] 是一个文明社会所不能容忍的活动。
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.	我认为，人类衰老也有这些特点， 它是一个不能容忍的活动。
What part of this do people not understand?	这有什么难明白的？
It's not just about life, of course -- -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.	这当然不只是生命， （众笑） 这也是有关可以健康的生活下去。 因为无论人们觉得死亡是否好玩[是否应该容忍]， 身体越来越衰弱，悲惨地依赖别人一点都不好玩。
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.	因此，其实这就是我想要对它的[人类衰老]描述。
It's a global trance.	这[它]是一个全球性恍惚。
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging.	这是人们对老龄化作出了 种种令人难以置信的借口。
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless.	而且，我的意思是，好吧，我不是在说 这些借口是完全没有价值。
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.	这些借口也有一些好的积极方面。 比如说我们应该思考的种种问题，有规划些， 来尽量减少我们在战胜老化路途上 的不必要的动荡。
But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion.	但只要如果你真正衡量它们， 这些借口都是完全疯了！
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.	你知道，这些[借口的]论点 是合理的，值得去关注。
But the question is, are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely, leaving aging as it is?	但问题是，这些论点有没有那么危险? 战胜老化的风险 有没有高过 不理会人类老化的代价？
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?	难道这些[修复老化的风险]如此糟糕， 比每天超过十万人面对早死的命运还糟糕？
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say.	你知道，如果你还没有比这一个说法更强的论点， 那么就不要浪费我的时间。这是我[对反对战胜老化]的看法。
Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.	（众笑） 话虽如此，有一种观点有些人认为， 确实是很强，我们就在这儿讨论一下。
People worry about overpopulation; they say, "Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.	人们担心人口过多，他们说， 好吧，如果我们战胜老化，没有人类死亡可言， 或至少是死亡人数变得低得多， 变得只有不小心越过圣吉尔斯河而死[笑话]。
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people."	因此，我们不需要有很多孩子， 可是孩子对多数人很重要。
And that's true.	这是事实。
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this.	你知道，很多人试图捏造这个问题， 并给予这样的答案。
I don't agree with those answers.	我不同意这些答案。
I think they basically don't work.	我认为它们根本行不通。
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.	我认为这是真的，我们会在这方面面临两难。
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate.	我们将必须决定是否有一个低生育水平， 或者高死亡率。
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies, in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.	拒绝这些战胜老化治疗，死亡率就会变高[和接受治疗的死亡率相比下]， 当然，在这种情况下我们就能生许多孩子。
And, I say that that's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.	我觉得这没问题 – 人类的下一代，有权做出这个选择。
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.	不正确和不应该的是我们现在就替下一代的做出这个选择。
If we vacillate, hesitate, and do not actually develop these therapies, then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies, but will not be, because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could -- we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span, and I consider that that is immoral.	如果因为我们犹豫， 而不开发这些[战胜老化的]疗法， 那么我们就等于判了我们的子孙一个不能永远活着的命运。 本来因为他们够年轻，够健康， 可以获益于这些疗法。
So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?	好，接下来的是， 为什么我们应该在这一方面积极点？
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.	最根本的答案是，[潜意识的认同老化是必然的] 亲老化恍惚并不像它看起来的那么笨。
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.	它其实是在应对无法避免的老化时的一个很明智的办法。
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.	老化是可怕的，但它是不可避免的，所以， 我们必须想尽办法把这想法从我们头脑中忘记， 理性地去做我们想要做的事情来改变。
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all.	例如，人类会想出这些荒谬的原因 来解释其实老化是件好事。
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.	当然，这些[荒谬]的原因的起因有两个连接部分[一是老化，二是命中注定。]
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem.	只要命中注定那个部分在我们的脑海中没那么的肯定， 我们就可以开始对战胜老化采取行动， 这是老化问题的一部分。
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.	这亲老化恍惚常常妨碍人们解决老化这个问题。
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot -- in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard.	这就是为什么我们一定要继续提出以及谈论这个课题， 我甚至会说 – 为了吸引人们的注意力，使人们认识到， 他们在这方面的恍惚，
So that's all I'm going to say about that.	关于这个话题我就说到这里。
I'm now going to talk about feasibility.	我现在要谈的是第三点，打败老化的可行性。
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.	其根本原因，我想，为什么我们认为老化是不可避免的， 是可以用我在这儿给老化的定义作为总结。
A very simple definition.	这是一个非常简单的定义。
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism.	老化是一种活着的副作用， 也就是说，新陈代谢的副作用。
This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement.	这并不是一个完全同义重复的声明， 它是一个合理的声明。
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us, despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms, because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.	老龄化基本上是一个过程，发生在无生命的物体如汽车， 也发生在人类的身上， 尽管我们的身体有很多聪明的自我修复机制， 因为这些自我修复机制还不完善[我们还是会老化]。
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects.	基本上，新陈代谢，就是说 [在我们身体里]所有为了让我们能够每一天活着所维持的种种化学过程， 有副作用。
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.	这些副作用会不断的积累，最终导致病理[不可避免的死亡]。
That's a fine definition.	这是一个不错的定义。
So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.	因此，我们可以这样表达, 我们可以说，大家都知道，我们有着这一系列事件。
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.	而且根据大多数人，对于推迟衰老， 只有两种方法。
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."	这两种方法就是老年学和老年医学。
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident, and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon.	老年医学医生会在一个人老化过程的后段， 病理越来越明显的时候， 做治疗来尽量阻止老化时间 和副作用积累 并且阻止那么快就造成不可避免地死亡。
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on.	当然，这是一个非常短暂的战略，是一个败仗， 因为导致病理[不可避免地死亡]的这些副作用 会随着时间的推移越来越多。
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure.	老年学的方法在表面上看起来更充满希望具发展前景， 因为你们也知道，预防胜于治疗。
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.	但不幸的是，我们对新陈代谢的理解非常少。
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet.	事实上，我们对生物体的了解少的可怜 – 甚至细胞，我们都不是很懂。
We've discovered things like, for example, RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.	连对细胞如何操作的 基本知识， 例如核糖核酸机能失常， 在仅仅几年前,我们才发现它。
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention.	基本上，如果我们要讨论在我们一生中能用到的延长寿命的治疗， 老年学以后将会是一个很好的方法， 但它的时机未到[因为我们对新陈代谢的理解还太少]。
So then, what do we do about that?	然后呢，这怎么办呢？
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it?	我的意思，这是一个很好的逻辑， 听起来非常有说服力的，不是吗？
But it isn't.	但事实并非如此。
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two.	在我告诉你为什么不能之前， 我要谈谈我所谓的第二步。
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire -- let's say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.	我们假设，如果正如我所说的， 我们 - 假设说今天 – 就拥有能够给现在已是中年，假设说五十五岁的人， 多三十年的健康寿命的治疗方法。
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation."	我称这为强健人类再生 。
OK.	好。
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live?	那么实际上这对于现在不同年龄的人们， 或者相等地，当这些治疗方法到达时 已是不同年龄的人有什么影响呢？ 他们会活多久些呢？
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple, but it's not simple.	你可能会认为回答这个问题很简单， 但它并不简单。
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer."	我们不能只是说：好吧，如果他们足够年轻，得益于这些治疗方法， 那么他们就会活[比本来]多三十年的时间。
That's the wrong answer.	这是错误的答案。
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.	而错误的原因是因为进步。
There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose.	对于我们这方面的治疗， 科学进步有两种。
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.	第一种是突破性的进步， 然后还有第二种就是不断的在那些突破性的进步上做出改良和提高它们的有效率。
Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames.	这两种科学进步所需的 时间的预测度有很大的不同。
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough.	我们很难预测 多久才会有 突破性的进步。
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.	人类很有可能在很多年前就想在天空上飞行了， 可是要等到一九零三年才发现到底怎么飞行。
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.	可是这之后，人类飞行的科技就很有步骤地发展下去。
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight.	我认为这是一个很合乎情理才导致了 动力飞行的科技进展。
We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.	我们可以想象这些科技发展的每一步都是 上一步的研发人所想不到的。
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore.	比起原先每次都递进增值 有进展。
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.	在每个科学突破性的进步后，您都会看到这些有步骤性的发展。
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.	而且在很多科技上都是这样。
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later.	比如说电脑，和飞行科技也很类似， 只是发生的时间不同罢了。
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics -- you know, the same sort of time frame.	您也可以看一看医药保健科技，比如说卫生，疫苗，抗生素， 也有着一样的发展时间表。
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all.	因此，我认为其实两个步骤，我刚才称为一个步骤， 并不完全是一个步骤。
That in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive, will be at some sort of cusp.	事实上，很年轻的人 会从这些实验治疗方法受益， 能使人们的生命适量延长， 即使这些人已经中年，当这些治疗方法来到 人们还可以尝试治疗方法。
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.	他们多数活得足够长来接受改进的治疗方法， 从而使他们多活30年甚至50年。
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.	换句话说，他们将领先于老化的速度。
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.	治疗法比起治疗法中存在的缺陷 改进得更快。
This is a very important point for me to get across.	这是我想说的非常重要的一点。
Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.	因为，很多人一听到 我推测很多现在活着的人将会活到一千或更多年以上， 他们都在想，哦，我们将会在这几十年内发明 延缓老化的治疗方法， 研究如何活到一千年甚至更多的治疗方法。
I'm not saying that at all.	我并不是这么说。
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough.	我说的只是这些延长寿命的治疗方法的 发展速度会足够使人们继续活下去。
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.	这些治疗方法我想永远都不可能完美， 但我们将可以在还没有两百岁的人之前就研究到如何治疗两百岁的人所死于的病理因素。
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.	接下来，我们就在还没有三，四百岁的人之前就研究到如何治疗三，四百岁的人所死于的因素。
I decided to give this a little name, which is "longevity escape velocity."	我称这为长寿逃逸速度， 要逃离死亡，长寿治疗方法必有快速的发展，叫逃逸速度。
Well, it seems to get the point across.	这是个很容易明白的名称。
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live, in terms of remaining life expectancy, as measured by their health, for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.	这就是我们可以期待 在余下的预期寿命， 以他们的健康来衡量， 到了一定年龄，相对应的治疗就相应而出。
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.	如果你已经100岁，或者你是80岁， 平均80岁， 我们可能很难为您做些什么， 因为您的时间不多了。 所以最初的，实验性疗法对你已经不起作用了。
You won't be able to withstand them.	你将无法避免老化。
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense, in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental, and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.	可是，如果您才五十岁的话， 您很有可能像我刚刚描述的那个样子摆脱了老化去世的问题。 您不但可以活的更久些， 某种意义上 你的青春，从身体和头脑上， 你的生命变得更加年轻， 你死于和老化有关的病症的几率也会降低。
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.	当然，如果你还不到五十岁的话， 您更有可能永远摆脱了老化去世的问题， 而不会虚弱因老化而生成的疾病死亡。
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies.	因此，这是我得到的一个真正的结论，就是说第一位[能够活到一百五十岁 – 我们不知道该人现在多老了， 因为我们不知道第一代[延长寿命的] 疗法要多久才会出现。
But irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes -- is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.	但无论是年龄， 我声称的第一人会活到一千年的人 – 当然，排除全球性灾难 - 实际上， 大概只有比我说的那位活到一百五十岁的人年轻十岁左右。
And that's quite a thought.	很令人值得想一想的结论吧。
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk, my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one; namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity?	好，接下来我要用这个讲座所剩下的时间， 我的七个半分钟来谈谈我所谓的第一个步骤， 就是我们如何得到这第一批延长寿命的适中治疗， 使我们可以达到长寿逃逸速度？
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.	而为了做到这一点，我需要说一点点关于老鼠的事。
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average.	就是我们要采用一种长寿的老鼠， 就等于平均可以活三年左右的老鼠。
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.	我们完全没有碰过它们，直到它们已经两岁。
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them, and with those therapies, we get them to live, on average, to their fifth birthday.	然后我们对它们做了一大堆的东西， 用那些治疗方法使它们延长寿命， 想办法让他们平均活到五岁。
So, in other words, we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapies.	因此，换句话说，我们开始把这些老鼠治疗后，添加了两年寿命 – 已经是它们剩余寿命 的三倍。
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?	接下来的问题是，到底什么时候， 我们讨论的这些才能用在人类身上呢？
Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.	我们现在可以，正如我已经解释过， 把它称为强健人类再生，或长寿逃逸速度。
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice?	第二，从我们得到的第一只老鼠时开始， 公众对多久我们才能获得这些东西， 对这些科技的发展有什么影响？
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it?	第三，问题是，它对多少人想要避免老化的人们起作用？ 这些科技有什么影响呢？
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer.	我的看法是， 第一个问题完全是生物学的问题， 这是非常难回答。
One has to be very speculative, and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation, that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.	一个人必须非常投机， 和我的许多同事会说，我们不应该做这种推测， 我们应该简单地保持沉默，直到我们了解更多。
I say that's nonsense.	我觉得这是一派胡言。
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.	保持沉默，绝对是不负责任的。
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame, in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities.	我们需要给我们最好的猜测有时间框架， 以便使人们有个概念， 使他们能够评估他们的优先事项。
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.	所以，我说，从我们应用强健老鼠再生的科技 的十五年内，我们有百分之五十的机会 实现强健人类再生科技 这个重要的里程碑。
15 years from the robust mouse.	强健老鼠再生的科技应用的十五年内，
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.	人们的看法可能会变好。
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.	因为人们往往低估的科学进步的困难性。
So they'll probably think it's five years away.	因此，他们很可能会认为只需五年。
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.	他们可能是错误的，但实际上这不太重要。
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.	最后，当然，我认为公众对于老龄化 的看法这么的矛盾的主要原因， 是我刚才谈到的全球恍惚的应对策略。
That will be history at this point, because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.	这将是历史性的一刻， 因为公众将不再认为老化是人类不可避免的， 因为它已经非常有效地在小老鼠体内被推迟。
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course that has enormous implications.	因此，我们很可能会看到人们的观念有了巨大变化， 而这将会具有极大的影响。
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.	为了现在要告诉你我们要如何得到这些老鼠， 我要补充一点我对老化的描述。
I'm going to use this word "damage" to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology.	我会用损害这个词来表示 所有由新陈代谢中阶段造成的东西， 而最终导致不可避免的死亡。
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.	因为这个关键的是， 尽管这些损害只有在最终才会造成不可避免的死亡， 它们是从我们出生之前就开始累积的东西，我们整个人生它们都不断累积。
But it is not part of metabolism itself.	但是这些损害不是新陈代谢的一部分，
And this turns out to be useful.	这一点对我们来说是有益的。
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.	因为这样我们可以重新绘制我们的原始图。
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage.	我们可以说，老年学和老年病学之间根本区别就是， 老年学试图抑制[避免]新陈代谢[的副作用]， 这些损害累积的速度。
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment.	我等一下会准确地解释我所谓 的损害在生物学里指的是什么。
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.	这是一个败仗， 因为损害只会继续积累。
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.	如果我们这样看的话，有第三种办法。
We can call it the "engineering approach," and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.	我们可以把它叫做工程方法， 我声称工程方法是在人类的科技，技术范围之内。
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.	该工程方法不会干预任何[我们身体内的新陈代谢的]过程。
It does not intervene in this process or this one.	它不会干预这个过程，也不干预这一个。
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle, and it's something that we are within range of being able to do, because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.	这很好，因为这意味着这不是一个败仗， 并且它是在我们现在的[技术]范围之内能够做到的事情， 因为它不涉及对人类进化改善。
The engineering approach simply says, "Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot, so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."	该工程方法只是表示， 我们定期修复所有的这些不同类型的损害 – 他们不一定完全修复[这些损害]， 但修复的足以让我们继续避免 一个会造成导致死亡或生病的程度。
We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.	我们知道这个门槛程度的存在， 因为我们只有当我们在中年时才会得到与年龄有关的疾病， 即使损害已经从我们诞生时就开始累积了。
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.	为什么我说，[工程方法]在人类近期的技术范围内呢？这[图片]基本上就是原因。
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.	这图片的重点在底部。
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another.	如果我们试图说新陈代谢的那个部分才是对老化过程有着重要的影响， 那我们可能要在这里呆一整晚， 因为基本上新陈代谢的每个组件都对老化有影响。
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.	这个列表仅仅是一个例子，它是不完整的。
The list on the right is also incomplete.	右边的列表也一样不完整。
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list.	它们只是一种与年龄 有关的病的列表。
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end, or that might cause pathology.	但这中间的我主张是完整的列表， 所有代谢副作用有资格被称为损害， 最终会导致病理[不可避免的死亡] 或可能造成病理类型。
And there are only seven of them.	而这列表只有七个。
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.	当然，这七个是类别，但只有七个。
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.	细胞损失，染色体突变，在线粒体基因突变等。
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.	首先，我想给你们解释一个为什么我认为这份列表是完全的。
Of course one can make a biological argument.	当然，我们可以使用生物学的角度来争论。
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?"	可以说，好，我们是什么做的？
We're made of cells and stuff between cells.	我们是由细胞和细胞间的东西。
What can damage accumulate in?	损害可以累积在那里？
The answer is: long-lived molecules, because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.	答案是，长期存在的分子里， 因为如果一个短暂寿命的分子遭到破坏，它将会在寿命完了后被销毁 – 就像蛋白质被水解摧毁 – 累积的损害也一起被销毁了。
It's got to be long-lived molecules.	所以损害累积的地方一定是很长寿命的分子里。
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.	因此[因为这个理由的很大的可能性]，这七个东西，都是由老年学士很久以前就讨论过了。 这是相当好的消息，因为这意味着， 尽管我们在这二十年里对生物学有着很大的成就， 这份列表还只有七样东西是一个非常好的迹象， 因为它显示它已不可再增加了。
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all, in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is, we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.	这个消息比你们想象的更好， 因为我们在原则上知道如何在老鼠里解决所有这些七样东西 – 我所谓的原则指的是， 我们或许可以真正实现在十年内这些修复治疗。
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.	其中有些[七样里的]部分已经落实了，尤其是在顶部的。
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it.	我[在这里]没有时间一个一个的解释， 但我的结论是，如果我们能够得到适合的资金， 那么我们或许可以在只有十年内成功发展强健的大规模人类再生[治疗科技]， 但我们确实需要认真想想它。
We do need to really start trying.	我们需要真正开始尝试。
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience, and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.	对于观众里的生物学家， 你们可能有一些问题，我会回答你们。
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk, but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.	你可能对这个讲座有些不满， 但你必须去阅读这些[已经刊登在研究杂志]内容，
I've published a great deal on this; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based, and there's quite a lot of detail there.	我已经刊登了对老化很多的资料； 而且我就凭着这些研究为基础对人类老化治疗科技持乐观态度， 里头的细节还有很多。
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.	这些细节使我对我在这里预测的 相当挑战性的时间表更加有信心。
So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.	如果你觉得我错了， 我希望你能看了这些资料以及研究报考后再来解释为什么你认为我是错的。
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because, as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously.	最主要的是你不应该相信 自称是老年医学的人， 因为在任何领域里 如果有激进的思想变化，主流的人一定有点抵抗 而且不认真的对待它。
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true.	所以，你必须真正做好准备工作， 才能了解这是否属实。
And we'll just end with a few things.	我们在结束前就讲讲几件事。
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."	有一件事就是，你将会在下届会议听一个家伙说起以前， 当他说他可以测序人类基因组时，人们是怎么的回答他。 每个人都说：这是不可能的。
And you know what happened.	可是你也知道，
So, you know, this does happen.	这确实发生了。
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize, which is basically an incentive to innovate, and to do what you think is going to work, and you get money for it if you win.	我们有不同的策略 – 有玛士撒拉奖， 这基本上是一个鼓励创新， 做你认为是可行的[方法延长寿命]， 如果成功的话，你就可以赢钱。
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.	还有一个计划建议组织一个机构，
This is what's going to take a bit of money.	可是这将会需要点钱。
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?	我的意思是，你看我们在伊拉克战争上耗这么久浪费了多少钱？
Not very long.	不会再久吧。
OK.	好吧。
It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech, but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.	（众笑） 这些研究的钱的来源最好是[私人]慈善，因为利润会分散生物技术研究公司[的注意力]， 但我认为它[我所提出的这些时间表和延长人类寿命的治疗科技的发展蓝图]]基本上有着百分之九十的机会成功。
And I think we know how to do it.	因为我们已经知道应该怎么做。
And I'll stop there.	我就说到这里。
Thank you.	谢谢您。
OK.	（鼓掌） 克里斯安德森：好。
I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance.	我不知道大家有没有问题， 但我想我会给他们机会。
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?	观众：既然你在谈论老龄化，并试图战胜它， 那为什么你看上去就像一位老人呢？
AG: Because I am an old man.	（众笑） 奥布里德格雷：因为我是一个老人。
I am actually 158.	其实我是已经是一百五十八岁。
Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.	（众笑） （鼓掌） 观众：这个星球上的物种进化了免疫系统， 以对抗各种的疾病，使个人活到足够生育的年龄。
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die, so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.	不过，据我所知，所有的物种都进化到实际会死亡， 因此，当细胞分裂时，端粒酶变得越来越短了，最终物种死亡。
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?	那么，为什么进化过程似乎已选定针对永存不朽？ 或者那只是进化过程还不完整？
Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.	我要告诉你主流思想的答案来回答你的问题， 我也恰巧同意这个答案。 那就是，不，老化不是一个进化过程的后果， 只是进化过程所忽视的后果。
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter, doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals, living a long time or by procreation, there's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no immortal species.	因此，到进化不重要的程度， 不在乎是个体， 或则生活的很长的一段时间， 或则靠生育种种方法来把基因传给下一代，有一定的调节， 这就是为什么不同物种有不同的寿命， 但是这就是为什么没有永存的物种。
The genes don't care but we do?	克里斯安德森：这些基因并不关心，但我们关心？
AG: That's right.	奥布里德格雷：是的。
Audience: Hello.	观众：您好。
I read somewhere that in the last 20 years, the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.	我听说在过去的二十年中， 基本上这个星球上的人的平均寿命增长了十年。
If I project that, that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.	如果以这个资料推断，如果我没有在我的摩托车上发生任何事故， 我将能够活到一百二十岁。
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?	这意味着，我将会变成你所谓能够活到一千年研究课题之一？
AG: If you lose a bit of weight.	奥布里德格雷：如果你瘦一点儿。
Your numbers are a bit out.	（众笑） 你的数据有点出入。
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade.	标准的数字是， 寿命已经在每十年增长一至两年。
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.	因此，它不是你觉得或希望的那么好。
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.	不过，我打算尽快将它快速发展到每年寿命多一年。
Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo, and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.	观众：我被告知，许多我们成人的脑细胞， 实际上在胚胎里是就有了， 而脑细胞能活八十年左右的时间。
If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?	如果事实的确如此， 在生理的角度看，对再生[科技]的世界会有什么影响？
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years, as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?	如果在我身体的所有细胞， 可以活到八十年，而不是一个典型的在两个月就死去的细胞？
AG: There are technical implications certainly.	奥布里德格雷：当然，这是技术问题。
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate, especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway, because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.	基本上我们需要做的是取代大脑 的几个领域的细胞的流失率， 尤其是神经元，但我们不想比 那流失率更快地取代任何细胞 – 因为更换地太快会降低认知功能。
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification.	我刚刚说的没有不老化物种 是有点过于简单化。
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells.	有些物种没有老化。例如水螅 – 因为他们没有一个神经系统 – 也没有任何用于老化的的细胞 却有长寿的细胞组织。
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole.	去年，当我站在这里的时候，我在谈论我横跨 北极的游泳。
And while that swim took place three years ago, I can remember it as if it was yesterday.	那还是发生在3年前， 对我则好像是昨天一般。
I remember standing on the edge of the ice, about to dive into the water, and thinking to myself, I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening.	我还记得我站在冰层的边缘， 就要扎进水里， 然后我自己想到，我再也再也 不要看到地球上的这个地方， 这里是如此的让人恐惧。
The water is completely black.	那里的水是全黑色。
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade, or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.	水的温度是负1.7摄氏度， 华氏29度。
It's flipping freezing in that water.	那水里就是翻动的冰块。
And then a thought came across my mind: if things go pear-shaped on this swim, how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean?	然后一个念头在我脑中划过： 如果这场泳出了点问题， 我这冰冻的身体要花多长时间 才能沉到这 4500米的底部呢？
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible.	然后我告诫我自己，我要把这个念头尽快的 抛在我的脑后。
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up, listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy, and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water.	能让我扎入 这冰冷的水里 然后游了4千米的唯一方法就是 听着我的iPod，让我自己全力运转起来， 我听了所有的歌，从华丽的歌剧 到吹牛老爹， 然后全身心的投入 没有什么比下定决心还要厉害的 －－ 然后走到冰的边缘 扎入水里。
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, and it felt like 18 days.	这次游泳花了我 18分50秒， 但好像是18天一样。
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers, and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know, we're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands, and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst.	我记得当我从水里出来时 我的手时如此的疼痛 然后我看着我的手指， 我的手指真的像香肠一样粗 因为－－你们知道了，我们身体一部分由水组成 －－ 当水结冰时会膨胀， 这样我手指的里细胞 就冷冻了，膨胀了 炸裂了。
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following: I'm never, ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again.	我从水里上岸的一瞬间的想法 时这样的： 我一生中 再也再也不要去在冰冷的 水里游泳了。
Anyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the -- and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change.	就这样，去年，我听到了喜马拉雅山 以及那里融化的－－ 因为气候变化 所融化的冰川。
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.	我听说了这个湖泊，映佳湖。
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier.	这个湖是几年前 由于冰川融化所形成的。
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake.	这些冰川顺山而下 然后在这里留下了这个大湖。
And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great, big battleground on this earth.	由此我坚信 我要去看见的喜马拉雅 就是我下一个在地球上的 战场。
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas.	将近20亿的人口 －－ 世界上三分之一的地球人口 －－ 依靠着喜马拉雅山的水源。
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is, and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much, I think we have a real risk of instability.	而世界人口照这个速度发展下去， 而冰川水源的提供 －－ 由于气候的变化 －－ 下降的如此之快， 我像我们就有了一个十分不稳定的威胁。
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, all these countries.	北方，我们由中国；南方，我们有印度，巴基斯坦，孟加拉， 和其它所有国家。
And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest, the highest mountain on this earth, and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest.	这样我决定了 登上珠峰， 地球上的最高峰， 如何在珠峰下 游一次 具有象征意义的泳。
Now, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest, but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.	我不知道，你们是否有机会去珠峰， 但是要去那的话，是一个考验。
28 great, big, powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don't just have my Speedo, but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world.	28只巨大的牦牛 载着所有的仪器登上山峰 －－ 我不仅仅带这我的泳裤。 还有一个摄像团队 这个摄像团队，会向世界各地直播。
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude.	这次游泳的挑战不仅仅只有 海拔。
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.	我想做的是在5300米的海平面上游泳。
So it's right up in the heavens.	所以直达天堂。
It's very, very difficult to breath.	这里呼吸十分，十分困难。
You get altitude sickness.	你会有高原反应。
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time.	你会感到有一个人不停的那着一把锤子 在敲你的后脑勺。
That's not the worst part of it.	这还不是最差的。
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.	最糟糕的是，这一年他们决定 在珠峰上做一个大扫除。
Many, many people have died on Mt.	许多人死在珠峰上， 然后今年，他们决定 收回珠峰上所有的尸体 然后把他们带下山。
And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you're trying to do that, and then the bodies are coming past you, it humbles you, and you also realize very, very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are.	 在5300米的海拔高度上，没有任何鱼在那里游过。 当你尝试着去做这些事情， 然后你看到这些尸体和你擦肩而过， 这让人不禁有些气馁， 也让你就会清晰的认识到 自然比我们要 强大多了。
And we walked up this pathway, all the way up.	然后我们就沿着这条路 一直走上去。
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier.	然后在我们的右手边 是巨大的昆布冰川。
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice.	然后，我们在沿路经过所看到的冰川的 都是一大块融化的冰块。
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest, and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself, for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.	然后我们到达在珠峰下 的一个小湖这 然后我开始准备自己， 像往常一样准备自己， 因为这样的游泳方式会是十分艰难的。
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music, I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water.	我带上我的iPod, 我听听歌， 我让我能有多激奋就多激奋－－ 但是是可以控制的激奋 －－ 然后我把我自己扎进 水里。
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters, and then I realized very, very quickly, I had a huge problem on my hands.	我尽力的游着 最起码在前一百米， 然后，我突然意识到， 我面临一个巨大的问题。
I could barely breathe.	我几乎不能呼吸。
I was gasping for air.	我喘了一口气。
I then began to choke, and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.	然后我开始呛水了， 这导致我在水里呕吐。
And it all happened so quickly: I then -- I don't know how it happened -- but I went underwater.	这一切发生的如此之快 然后 －－ 我不知到是怎么发生的 －－ 但是我沉入水底。
And luckily, the water was quite shallow, and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air.	但幸运的是，水比较的浅， 我可以从湖底跳起来 然后喘另一口气。
And then I said, carry on.	然后我说道，坚持，坚持，坚持。
I carried on for another five or six strokes, and then I had nothing in my body, and I went down to the bottom of the lake.	我继续划了五到六下水， 然后我就筋疲力尽了， 我沉入湖底。
And I don't where I got it from, but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake.	但是我不知从哪来的力气， 我可以就这样 把自己从湖底以最快的速度 弄到湖的岸边。
I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have.	我听说过溺水 是你可以死的最安详的方式。
I have never, ever heard such utter bollocks.	我从来没有听过 这样的胡说八道。
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have.	这是你们所感受过的 最恐惧，最惊慌的感觉。
I got myself to the side of the lake.	我把我自己拽到湖岸。
My crew grabbed me, and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp.	我的队友抓住了我， 然后我们以最快的速度 下山－－在碎石中－－ 到达我们的营地。
And there, we sat down, and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest.	在那里，我们坐下来， 然后我们做了一下在珠峰 哪里出错的报告。
And my team just gave it to me straight.	然后我的队员直接告诉我。
They said, Lewis, you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim.	他们说道，Lewis, 你要有一个 剧烈的战术变化 如果你想完成这个游泳。
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming, you must forget.	你必须忘掉 在23年里所学到的游泳 里所有的东西。
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army, about speed and aggression, you put that to one side.	以及忘掉你在英国部队里 所学习的， 关于那些速度和激奋， 你要先放在一旁。
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.	我们想让你花两天走上山。
Take some time to rest and think about things.	花点时间休息和思考。
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time, and instead of swimming fast, swim as slowly as possible.	我们想让你花两天走上山。 不要游的太快， 但是慢慢的游。
Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.	不用自由泳，但是用蛙泳。
And remember, never ever swim with aggression.	然后记住，不要游太激奋。
This is the time to swim with real humility.	是时候谦逊地 去游泳了。
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later.	所以我们又走了回去 两天后回到山峰下。
And I stood there on the edge of the lake, and I looked up at Mt. Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself, just do this slowly.	我站在那 在湖的边缘， 然后望向珠峰 －－ 她是地球上最美丽的山峰之一 －－ 我就像这样慢慢的对我自己说道。
And I swam across the lake.	然后我游过了这个湖泊。
And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side.	我无法告诉你们 当我到达湖的另一边时 我感觉有多好。
But I learned two very, very important lessons there on Mt.	但是我从珠峰学习到两个十分，十分 重要的教训。
Everest, and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.	 我十分感谢我队伍中的夏尔巴告诉了我这些。
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well, doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.	第一个就是 一个事情无论原来是怎样的， 并不代表在未来就会怎样。
And similarly, now, before I do anything, I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task.	相同的， 现在，在我做一件事情之前， 我问到我自己，我需要 怎样的一种态度 才能成功的完成我的任务。
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is, frankly, the Mt. Everest of all problems -- just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long, just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long, doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on.	然后这样来想一想气候变化， 那是，说实话， 珠峰和其他所有的问题－－ 不能因为我们已经像这样生活了这么长时间， 不能因为我们已经像这样消费了那么长时间 不能因为我们像这样人口增长了这么长时间， 就意味着我们可以这样像 以往一样坚持下去。
The warning signs are all there.	警告信号就在那。
When I was born, the world's population was 3.5 billion people.	当我出生时，世界的人口 只有35亿。
We're now 6.8 billion people, and we're expected to be 9 billion people by 2050.	现在有68亿 然后我们预计在2050年有 90亿。
And then the second lesson, the radical, tactical shift.	这里就有第二个教训， 剧烈的战术改变。
And I've come here to ask you today: what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment, which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world, and most importantly, in a sustainable world?	我今天来到这里问你们： 你在你的环境里 能做出怎样的剧烈的战术转变 才能保证 我们的子孙 能居住在一个安全的 一个保险的世界， 最重要的是，一个可持续发展的世界？
And I ask you, please, to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make, which will make that big difference, and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.	然后我要求你，请你们，从这里出发 然后想象 你要做怎样的 激进的战术变化， 才能做出巨大的改变， 如何下定决心去做。
Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it, and commit a hundred percent, because very, very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it.	些关于这些变化的博客，微博，谈论一下， 然后全身心投入。 因为如果我们 全身心投入，只有很少事情 是不可能的。
So thank you very, very much.	所以，十分感谢你们。
Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design, and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.	今天我将给你们解析 3个现代标志性的设计案例， 我觉得自己是非常合适的人选 来解释这些 因为我有文学本科文凭。
But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs, so I pretty much know everything there is.	但是我在电视圈里 也是个小名人 和一个狂热的 设计作品收藏者， 所以我很清楚 这里面的猫腻。
Now, I'm sure you recognize this object; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days.	现在，我很确定你们 可以认出这个东西； 你们当中的很多人很有可能见过它 当你们的私人飞艇 在过去的几天里 降落在洛杉矶国际机场时。
This is known as the Theme Building; that is its name for reasons that are still very murky.	这个被称为主题大楼； 至于起这个名字的原因 至今不明。
And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.	并且这也许是我们 在洛杉矶有 远古外星人建筑的最好实例。
It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX, although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era, when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants.	它始建于1961年 也是洛杉矶国际机场在建时 尽管科学家们相信 它可以追溯到 公元前2000 年， 当时它被用作 一个繁忙的跨维空间港口， 那些远古宇航员们 他们首先开拓了这个殖民星球 让我们这些种族 脱离了野蛮， 并且教会了我们语言 和科技 还有送给我们这个空中餐厅作为礼物。
It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located, of course, at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously, the much better access to parking.	它被认为是 一个古老太空港的替代品， 当然，古老太空港指的是巨石阵 并且它被认为是 一个经过改进的 干净的设计， 没有了周围德鲁伊教挂像， 并且显而易见的是，它有很方便进出的 停车场。
When it was uncovered, it ushered in a new era of streamlined, archaically futuristic design called Googie, which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age, a misnomer.	当它被建好后， 它引领了一个新设计时代， 即流线型古风的未来派设计 也叫做古吉派， 后来被等同于喷气机时代 是个错误的说法。
After all, the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often, preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls.	毕竟，古代宇航员并不常用 喷气式飞机旅行， 他们更喜欢乘坐 由水晶头骨驱动的羽蛇。
Ah yes, a table.	啊，是的，一张桌子。
We use these every day.	我们每天都会用的桌子。
And on top of it, the juicy salif.	还有在它的上面， 一个榨汁机。
This is a design by Philippe Starck, who I believe is in the audience at this very moment.	这是由菲利普·斯塔克设计的， 我相信现在他就在观众席里。
And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision, its playfulness, its innovation and its promise of imminent violence.	你们一眼可以认出是斯塔克的设计 因为它的精致，趣味感, 创新性和 暴力临头感。
It is a design that challenges your intuition -- it is not what you think it is when you first see it.	这个设计很挑战你们的直觉 - 它不是你们一眼就能认出的东西。
It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time, which would be useful out in the lobby, I would say.	它不是一个三脚叉 一次可以叉到三个开胃菜， 当然我想说这种三脚叉在外面休息室里 会有些作用。
And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism, it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts.	尽管很明显,它的设计 受到远古外星人的影响 并且它很有宇宙太空感又是三角架样式， 但它不是设计用来 扎牢在你的大脑上 并且吸取你的思想。
It is in fact a citrus juicer and when I say that, you never see it as anything else again.	事实上它是一个榨汁机 一旦我说穿了， 你就再也不会认为它是别的什么东西了。
It is also not a monument to design, it is a monument to design's utility.	它不仅是是一个设计经典， 更是一个实用设计的典范。
You can take it home with you, unlike the Theme Building, which will stay where it is forever.	你可以拿它回家， 这与主题大楼不一样， 它将永远待在原址上。
This is affordable and can come home with you and, as such, it can sit on your kitchen counter -- it can't go in your drawers; trust me, I found that out the hard way -- and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design.	它很实惠 并且可以带回家， 就像这样，把它放到 厨房台面上 - 不要把它放到抽屉里； 相信我，我曾很努力的尝试过 - 并且它会把你的厨房台面 变成一个设计典范。
One other thing about it, if you do have one at home, let me tell you one of the features you may not know: when you fall asleep, it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep.	另外， 如果你家里拥有一个这个， 让我告诉你一个你也许不知道的作用： 当你熟睡的时候， 它会活过来， 并且在你的房子里走来走去， 并且帮你查看信件， 并且在你睡觉的时候默默的看着你。
Okay, what is this object?	好吧，这是个什么东西？
I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is.	我没有一点头绪，我不知道这是什么。
It looks terrible.	它看起来很糟糕。
Is it a little hot plate?	是一块小电热板？
I don't get it.	我不清楚。
Does anyone know?	有没有人知道？
Chi?	琦？
It's an ... iPhone. iPhone.	它是...iPhone ，iPhone。
Oh yes, that's right, I remember those; I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days.	哦，是的，是这样，我记起来了； 我曾把浴室里的瓷砖 都换成了它，在过去美好的日子里。（开个玩笑）
No, I have an iPhone.	不，我有iPhone。
Of course I do.	我当然有。
Here is my well-loved iPhone.	这是我非常喜欢的iPhone。
I do so many things on this little device.	这个小手机让我做很多很多事。
I like to read books on it.	我喜欢用它读书。
More than that, I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect.	我更喜欢用它购买图书， 它不会让我感到不读书的内疚， 因为我把图书买到手机上后就再也不会看它们一眼， 这非常好。
I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox, for example.	我可以每天用它 举个例子， 称牛的重量。
Every now and then, I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally.	我承认 不时地， 我会偶尔用它打个电话。
And yet I forget about it all the time.	好在我还没有完全忘记这个功能。
This is a design that once you saw it, you forgot about it.	这个设计就是 当你第一眼看到它时， 你会忘记它。
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life.	它很容易就被忘记 发生在2007年的你第一次触摸它时的震惊感， 因为它普及的 太快了， 并且因为不知不觉间 我们已经习惯这些手势操作 并且成为我们日常生活的一部分。
Unlike the Theme Building, this is not alien technology.	不像主题大楼， 它不是外星科技。
Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate.	或者我应该说， 它所做的是应用这些高科技—— 不同于在座的各位， 对于世界上其他人来说， 还是会感到非常陌生,，如同外星科技般的技术—— 并让这项高科技很快上手 并被人熟悉使用。
And unlike the juicy salif, it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain, rather, it simply attaches itself to your brain.	而且不像榨汁机设计， 有一种强加于 你大脑之上的胁迫， 它是自然而然的 附加到了你的大脑上。
And you didn't even notice it happened.	并且你并没有注意到这种情况已经发生了。
So there you go.	就说这么多了。
My name is John Hodgman.	我的名字叫约翰･霍奇曼。
I just explained design.	刚才我解释了设计。
Thank you very much.	非常感激。
So I thought, "I will talk about death."	我原先在想：「我会谈论死亡。」
Seemed to be the passion today.	那似乎是我今天要跟你分享的主题。
Actually, it's not about death.	但事实上，我将分享的与死亡无关。
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.	死亡是不可避免而又令人愄惧的，但我真正想谈论的是 我被人们死去时所留下的遗产吸引着
That's what I want to talk about.	这就是我想分享的主题。
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."	如包可华 透过影像留下他那一丝幽默 影带在他死后随即出现，说着： 「嗨! 我是包可华，我刚刚死了。」
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer.	我透过TED的旅程，在加拉巴哥遇到米可 当时他透过互联网在个人空间上记述 他患上癌症的经历。
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.	而我的父亲则透过一些信件和一本记事本 留下他那手写的遗产。
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.	爸爸在他生命中的最后两年，在生病的状态中， 把他对我的看法都写满在记事本上。
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.	他写下我的长处和短处 并提出一些能助我改正的方法 同时亦引用特殊的例子，为我的生活提供反思。
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.	在他离世后，我发现没有人再写信给我了。
Handwriting is a disappearing art.	书写这门艺术正渐渐地消失。
I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new?	我平日会用电子邮件，也会一面思考一面打字 但为何要为了新的事物而舍弃旧有的习惯?
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?	为何书信和电子邮件不能与我们的生活融合在一起?
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug.	有一段时间我因为太忙碌而没有坐下来跟我父亲聊聊天 有时，我真的很想换回那几年 然后再以那些时光来换爸爸的一个拥抱。
But too late.	可是已经太迟了。
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him.	但每当我拿出并细阅他的信 我感到与他紧密相连, 因为他触摸过的那张信纸就在我手中。
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one.	也许，我们需要留给我们的孩子的不是金钱上的遗产 而是那种拥有真正的价值和意义的遗产。
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter.	透过触碰去留下有价值的物品-- 一本手写书，一封真摰的信。
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes.	假如这些甚有影响力的TED观众的其中小部分 能被感动而去买一张漂亮的纸-- 约翰，那会是一张环保再生纸-- 然后写一封美丽的信 给他们深爱的人，我们或许要开始实行一个大变革 让我们的孩子去上手写课。
So what do I plan to leave for my son?	那么，我应该留些什么给我的儿子呢？
I collect autograph books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy.	我在搜集手写书, 同时也在搜集一些唱片, 翠丝。 而坐在观众席上的一些作家都知道 我正为这出版的事宜而紧跟著他们--
I plan to publish my own notebook.	我亦计画出版自己的笔记。
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.	在我目睹我父亲的遗体被火吞噬时， 我坐在他葬礼的柴火旁，写下
I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son.	我不知道我将如何过日子 但后来我决定要将他和我的一些想法 辑录成一本书、出版, 然后留给我的儿子。
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation.	我想以一首我在父亲葬礼中写的短诗 来结束今天的分享。
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.	语言学学者们, 请饶恕我的文法 因为我至少有十年没读到这首诗了。
I took it out for the first time to come here.	这是我第一次将它公开在这里。
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up.	「在相框中的照片,在瓮里的骨灰, 无穷的力量被紧封于瓮内 它迫使我面对现实 迫使我逐渐成长。
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me.	我确实听到你的话, 而我知道你想我坚强 但此刻, 我被这些肆虐的情绪浪潮 吞没、包围，这一切令我窒息 就如你所敎导一样 我渴望我的灵魂能被洗涤, 让我能尝试浮出水面 再一次踏稳每一步, 继续奋斗和茁壮地成长。
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again."	当我陷入绝望的漩涡时, 我听到你在我耳边低声鼓励我、 扶持我、并把我拉到岸边, 使我清醒, 让我能重生和再次去爱。」
Thank you.	谢谢。
I've always written primarily about architecture, about buildings, and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions.	我主要会写些关于建筑 关于楼房的东西 那些作品是基于某些假设。
An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place, or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes a city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places, at the end of the day, you can go and you can visit them.	建筑师设计一座大楼 变成一个地点 或很多建筑师设计很多座大楼 变成一个城市 先不去考虑这些复杂的力量掺杂在一起 比如政治的 文化的 经济的， 它们塑造 这些地点， 最终你都能 去参观它们。
You can walk around them.	 你可以在它们周围走一走
You can smell them.	你可以闻一闻它们的气息。
You can get a feel for them.	 你可以感受一下它们
You can experience their sense of place.	你可以体验一下它们的存在
But what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was I going out into the world, and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.	但近年来让我吃惊的是 我越来越少出门走向世界 越来越多地坐在我的电脑屏幕前
And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone, I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day, but I was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.	特别是从大概2007年开始，那时我有了一台iPhone 我不止整天坐在自己的电脑屏幕前面 我还在一天结束的时候 盯着我放在口袋里带着的这个小屏幕
And what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed.	让我吃惊的是 我和实体世界的关系多么迅速地发生了改变
In this very short period of time, you know, whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last, you know, four or five years of being online all the time, our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided. You know, we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking out in the world around us.	在很短的时间里，你知道， 不管你是说过去在线的15年 或是近期总是在线的四五年 我们和周围的关系已经大为改变： 我们的注意力一直受到分散 我们既看着这些屏幕 我们也看着身边的世界
And what was even more striking to me, and what I really got hung up on, was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own.	让我更加吃惊 更不安的是 屏幕里的世界 似乎没有任何实体存在。
If you went and looked for images of the Internet, this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it.	如果你去找因特网的影像 这就是你会找到的 这张非常有名的欧普特影像 就像银河系一样 无限延伸 我们似乎不在上面
We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.	我们永远都不能抓住它的整体
It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth, the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest, I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.	它常让我想起阿波罗号所拍的地球照片 那张蓝色大理石也似乎意味着 我认为，我们不能真正的理解地球这个整体
We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.	我们在无限之下显得非常渺小
So if there was this world and this screen, and if there was the physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them together in the same place.	所以即使存在这样的网络世界和这屏幕上的世界 如果它真的是围绕着我的实体世界 我甚至不能在同一个地方找到它
And then this happened.	然后发生了一件事
My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does, and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch, and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard, and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.	我的因特网某天断线了 它有时会这样 电线维修员来修理 他开始着手 先从沙发后面的布满灰尘的电线堆里 沿着它到了我房子的前面下了地下室到了后院外面 墙上有很大一捆杂乱的电线
And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire, and he said, "There's your problem.	然后他看到一只松鼠沿着电线跑动 他说 那就是问题所在
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet."	有松鼠在咀嚼着你的因特网
And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.	真让人吃惊 因特网是 一个卓越的构思 它是一系列的协议改变了 一切从购物到约会到革命的事
It was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on.	它绝然不是 一只松鼠可以咀嚼的事
But that in fact seemed to be the case.	但事实上情况就是如此
A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet.	真的有只松鼠在咀嚼我的因特网
And then I got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it. Where would it go?	我头脑中就有这么一幅将可能发生的画面 如果你从墙上把电线扯下来 如果你试着 沿着它走 会到哪里呢
Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?	因特网真是一个你可以到达的地方吗
Could I go there? Who would I meet?	我能到那吗 我会和谁见面
You know, was there something actually out there?	真的有这么一个地方吗
And the answer, by all accounts, was no.	答案是人人都说没有
This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it, as represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."	这就是因特网 这个带着红色灯的黑盒子 正如情景喜剧IT狂人里所显示的
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben, because that's where you get the best reception, but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.	通常它会放在大笨钟的最高处 因为那里是接收信号最好的地方 但他们谈到过他们的同事可以 在某个下午将它借去在办公室展示的时候使用
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while, and she looks at it and she says, "This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"	因特网的资深用户愿意和它分开 一会儿 她看着盒子说 这就是因特网吗 整个因特网 它重吗
They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."	他们回答 当然不重 因特网没有任何重量
And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for.	我感到很羞愧 我正在找的东西 只有傻瓜才会去寻找
The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it.	因特网是无形的 或者它是 一个闪着红灯的黑盒子
It wasn't a real world out there.	它不是一个真实的世界
But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there, and that's what I spent about two years visiting, these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit, and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York, which is one of the buildings in the world, one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings, where more networks of the Internet connect to each other than anywhere else.	但事实上它是一个真实的世界 确实有因特网的真实世界 也就是我花费了过去两年时间到访的 因特网的所在地 我在大型的数据中心 它们使用和所在城市一样多的能源 我参观了类似这样的地方，比如纽约的哈德逊街60号 它是一栋大楼 名单中仅有的十几座中的其中一座 那里是大量的网络连接彼此 的地方——比别处的连接更多
And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.	这样的连接确实是个有形的过程
It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is, connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network, and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.	那关乎着网络的路由器 比如面书或 谷歌或B.T.或康卡斯特或时代华纳 不管是什么 通常连接着黄色的光纤电缆 上至天花板一直到其他网络路由器 那通常都是有形的且是密切联系的
A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others, has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings.	像哈德逊街60号的大楼和其他十几栋或其他大楼 里面有超过十倍那么多的网络连接着它 相较其他大楼而言
There's a very short list of these places.	这些大楼不是很少
And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home to about a half a dozen very important networks, which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect Europe and America and connect all of us.	哈德逊街60号特别有趣是因为它是 近六个重要网络连接的总部 这些网络连接海底电缆 网络穿过海底 连接欧洲和美洲 连接我们所有人
And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.	我特别想谈谈那些电缆
If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath the ocean, cables like this.	如果因特网是个全球现象 如果我们活 在地球村里 那是因为有电缆 在海底 像这样的电缆
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.	从这个角度看 他们真的非常小
You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.	你可以用手握着它们 他们就像花园软管一样
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive, as expansive as you can imagine.	但从另一个角度看 他们非常广阔 就如你能想象的那般广阔
They stretch across the ocean. Light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other, and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood, and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles they amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams, but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.	它们在大海里延伸 它们有三或五 或八千英里那么长 如果说材料科学和计算机技术 是无比复杂的 当中的基本物理过程 却是惊人的简单 灯光从海的一边进去 再从另一边出来 通常是从 一座叫作坐落站的大楼出来 常在临近海边不显眼的地方妥善保存起来 在海床设有增强器 它们看起来像蓝鳍吞拿 每50英里 它们会增强信号 由于传播速度 无比迅速 基本单位是每秒10千兆比特 光波 也许是你连接速度的一千倍 或能承载1万个视频流 但不止那样 你不会只把一个光波 放在一条光纤里 你也许会在一根光纤里放 50或60或70个不同波长或颜色的光波 然后你也许会 在一个电缆里放8个光纤 四个又分散到不同方向
And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.	它们很细小 就像头发那么粗
And then they connect to the continent somewhere.	它们可以连接到大陆的某个地方
They connect in a manhole like this.	它们会在沙井里面连接起来 像这样。
Literally, this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.	 实际上 这是5千英里电缆接入的地方
This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.	这里是哈利法克斯 电缆从这里延伸到爱尔兰
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago, when I started thinking about this, there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa, represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.	景观在变化 三年前 当我开始思考这个问题的时候 有一条电缆 连接到非洲的西岸 也就是Steve Song这个地图上的小黑线
Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.	现在已经有六条电缆 还会有更多 三条连接到东岸
Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable, they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build an industry around it, they need to know that their connection isn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks, you have to send a ship out into the water, throw a grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end, and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.	因为一旦一个国家连接了一条电缆 他们会意识到这是不足够的 如果他们想在 电缆周围建立工业 他们需要知道他们的连接 不是脆弱的而是永久的 因为如果一个电缆断了 你得派船到海中央 扔个抓钩 钩起一头电缆 再勾起另一头 然后把两端焊接在一起 再把它丢到海里
It's an intensely, intensely physical process.	这真是个很折腾的物理过程
So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently worked for Tata Communications, the communications wing of Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.	这是我的朋友Simon Cooper 他最近 在Tata通讯公司工作 Tata通讯部 大型印度工业企业集团
And I've never met him. We've only communicated via this telepresence system, which always makes me think of him as the man inside the Internet.	我和他没有见过面 我们只是 视频通话 这常让我觉得 他是因特网里面的人
And he is English. The undersea cable industry is dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.	他是英国人 海底电缆工业 是由英国人主导的 他们大多看起来像42岁
Because they all started at the same time with the boom about 20 years ago.	因为他们都在同一时间入行 从20年前的兴盛时期开始的
And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic and one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces onto them, until they had built a belt around the world, which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.	Tata是以通讯业起家的 一开始他们买了两条电缆 一条横跨大西洋 一条横跨太平洋并继续完善它们 直到它们连接了整个世界 这意味着他们会把你的比特信息传送到东方或西方
They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world, and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around the other direction. And then having done that, they started to look for places to wire next.	他们有真的是有一束环绕地球的光 如果有电缆在太平洋中断开了 它会把光发送到 另一个方向 这么做以后 他们就开始寻找下一个连线的地方
They looked for the unwired places, and that's meant North and South, primarily these cables to Africa.	他们会寻找没有连线的地方 那意味着 北方或者南方 首先要连去非洲
But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.	让我惊奇的是Simon有非凡的地理想象力
He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.	他想象中的世界无限延伸
And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see one of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection, these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post or an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.	我非常好奇是因为我想看看 这些电缆是怎么建起来的 一直以来 上网的时候我们可以体验到这种一闪而过的迅速连网 这些轻易连接 一个推特或 一个面书贴子 或是一封电邮 似乎都有一个实体存在
It seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.	似乎有这么一个时刻当大陆 被连接起来 我想看看那个过程
And Simon was working on a new cable, WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa, to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.	Simon在负责者一条新电缆 西非电缆体系 从里斯本延伸到非洲西海岸 到科特迪瓦 加纳 奈及利亚 及喀麦隆
And he said there was coming soon, depending on the weather, but he'd let me know when, and so with about four days notice, he said to go to this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9, this guy will walk out of the water.	他说很快就会开始搭建 取决于 天气 他会告诉我具体时间 大概提前4天 他通知我前往 里斯本南部的这个海滩 大概9点以后 有个人从海里走出来
And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line, called a messenger line, and that was the first link between sea and land, this link that would then be leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.	他会带着绿色的尼龙绳 非常轻的绳子 那叫做悬缆线 那线首先连接 大海和陆地 接着会被 连接到这9千英里的光的通道
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place.	接着推土机开始把电缆拉起来 通过这艘专门的电缆安装船 电缆会浮动在 这些浮标上直到它在正确的位置
Then you can see the English engineers looking on.	接着你会看见一个英国工程师在探视
And then, once it was in the right place, he got back in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off, and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out to the ship, and when he got there, they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie, and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore, and then he lit a cigarette.	一旦电缆放对了地方 他就回到 水中手握一把大刀 切掉每个浮标 浮标升上天空 电缆 掉进海床 他沿途一直这么做 直到船变边 到了船边 他们递给他一杯果汁和一块曲奇 接着他再跳到水中 游回岸边 然后他点了根烟
And then once that cable was on shore, they began to prepare to connect it to the other side, for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.	当电缆拉到海岸边 他们准备把它连接到另一端 连接从陆地站拉过来的电缆
And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a -- sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down, and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.	一开始他们带着钢锯 然后刮掉塑料内层 像厨师一样工作 最后 他们像珠宝商一样把像头发般细小的纤维绑在 拉下来的电缆上 用这台打孔机把他们焊在一起
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.	当你看到这些人用钢锯处理电缆的时候 你不会把因特网想象像云一样虚无
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.	它似乎变成了非常有形的东西
And what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology, as much as this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process itself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.	让我同样吃惊的是 基于这无比复杂的技术 这是无比新兴的事物 它的物理过程 本身是需要很长的时间 背后的文化是一样的
You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer giving directions in the background. And more importantly, the places are the same. These cables still connect these classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa, Mumbai, Singapore, New York.	你看到了当地的劳工 你看到英国工程师 在后方给出指示 更重要的是 很多地方是一样的 电缆依旧连接着 这些经典的港口城市 像里斯本 蒙巴萨 孟买 新加坡 纽约
And then the process on shore takes around three or four days, and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover back on top, and they push the sand over that, and we all forget about it.	岸上的过程需时三或四天 做好后 他们把沙井盖 盖上 把沙推到上面掩盖 把这一切都忘掉
And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud, but every time we put something on the cloud, we give up some responsibility for it.	似乎我们老在讲云端的东西 每次我们把一些东西放到云端里 我们丢下了一些责任
We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.	我们很少去关注它 我们让其他人去担心它
And that doesn't seem right.	那是不对的
There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires.	著名的尼尔·斯蒂芬森曾经说过 连网的人应该知道网线的事
And we should know, I think, we should know where our Internet comes from, and we should know what it is that physically, physically connects us all.	我们应该知道 我认为 我们应该知道 我们的英特网从哪里来 我们应该知道 是什么东西实体上连接着我们所有人

Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame.	因此他只能怪罪自己。 这种默默的自责， 比责备他人更让人难受， 只是默默的自责。
As the child grows to become an adult: so far, it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor.	有一天孩子终于长大成人了。 但一个人的成长 最终取决于他们贡献能力的大小， 也就是说成为一个贡献者。

So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.	一个人必须要在自己身上发现一种完整。
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience.	现在我要说的就是达到这种完整状态的可能性。 这种可能性存在于我们的经历，每个人过去所经历的事情。
In spite of a very tragic life, one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.	即便一个人的生活极其苦难， 他时不时的还是会有少许快乐的时刻。
And the one who is happy, even for a slapstick joke, accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.	经历快乐时刻的人， 哪怕只是因为一个低级趣味的笑话， 从心底里是接纳自己的，并同时接纳存在于他周围的一切。

The subject -- "me" -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness, an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of," an experience common to all and sundry.	作为主体的我 和作为客体的世间万物 融为了一个整体。 这种体验没有人敢说自己没有过。 这是天下所有人的共同体验。
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations -- all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards and layoffs and, finally, baldness -- you can be happy.	这一体验给我们证明了一个道理：尽管人有各种各种的自身限制、 需求、欲望、未能实现的理想，信用卡的钱要还， 还有公司裁人的威胁， 再加上越来越严重的谢顶问题， 但你还是可以快乐起来的。
But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.	这也就是说， 你不需要非得满足什么欲望才能快乐。
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.	你自己正是你快乐的源泉，你自己就是你所追求的完整。
There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you.	这并没有什么好选择的， 它只说明了这样一个事实： 你的完整性就是你自己， 它不可能只是你的一部分，
It has got to be you.	它必须就是你；
You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole.	你也不可能只是你的完整性的一部分， 而同时还能保持一个整体。
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, that recognition: "Maybe I am the whole.	你经历的快乐时刻就是在向你揭示这样的一个事实、 一种顿悟和认识。 也许我就是完整的，

But if I say, in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black: body is limited any which way you look at it.	但如果我说，尽管我有诸多的自身限制， 黑的就是黑的，白的就是白的。
Limited.	 人的身体是有极限的，不管你从哪个角度去看它。
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited, and power is therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.	你的知识是有限的，健康也是有限的， 从而人的能力也是有限的， 快乐程度也是受限制的，
Compassion is going to be limited.	同情心也有限，
Everything is going to be limitless.	万事万物都是无限的。
You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are not.	你不能强求同情心， 除非你自己变得无限强大。
Period.	就是这样。
And there is no way of your being not limitless too.	然而另一方面，你也很难做到不无限强大。

Ask for compassion.	祈求同情心的到来，
Let me act compassionately.	让我能真正有同情心的去做事情。
Do it.	一定要去做。
You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion, and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching, you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness, and that's what you are.	这样你就一定会发现同情心， 然后慢慢的发现一种相对的有比较的同情心。 再然后，如果得到了正确的指点， 你会发现同情心是 你自身状态的一种动态体现，这种自身状态指的就是你的完整性和统一性， 这种自身状态同时定义了你究竟是谁。
With these words, thank you very much.	且到这里吧，谢谢！
The Kraken, a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales, and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.	北海巨妖，一只恐怖的野兽， 据说它吞食活人、船只和鲸鱼， 并且它是如此巨大以至于会被误认为是一座小岛。
In assessing the merits of such tales, it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time," and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit."	在评估这样的故事的真实性时， 聪明的做法也许是谨记着老水手 对童话和海洋传说的区别的看法 是童话往往这样开始：很久以前…… 而一个海洋传说会这样开始：这不是胡扯。
Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale.	每次讲一个关于跑掉的鱼的故事时， 这条鱼都会随着故事讲的次数而变大。
Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean, and we now have video proof, as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.	然而大海中也有巨人， 并且现在我们有了视频为证， 如果你们看过探索频道的纪录片，那肯定知道这个。
I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan.	我是参与探索旅程的三位科学家之一， 这次旅程于去年夏天在日本开展。
I'm the short one.	我是照片里最矮的那个。
The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.	其他两位是窪寺恒己博士和史蒂夫·欧谢伊博士。
I owe my participation in this now-historic event to TED.	我能参与到这个历史性的事件中来 这还要感谢 TED。
In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.	2010年有一场TED活动叫做蓝色使命 这场活动在停靠于加拉帕戈斯群岛的林德布拉德探险者号上进行 作为西尔维亚·厄尔的TED愿望的一部分。
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean, one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.	我讲了探索海洋的新途径， 其中一个重点是要吸引动物而不是将它们吓跑。
Mike deGruy was also invited, and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean, and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he's been involved with for a very long time, which is the hunt for the giant squid.	麦克· 德葛鲁也被邀请了， 他很有激情的讲了他对大海的热爱 并且他还讲到了应用我的方法 到一些他参与很久的项目中来， 那就是寻找巨型乌贼。
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit, a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.	是迈克让我能受邀参加乌贼研讨峰会， 那是在那个夏天的鲨鱼周中 在探索频道开展的一次乌贼专家聚会。
I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.	我发表了一个关于非介入观察 和使用光诱饵吸引深海乌贼的演讲。 我强调了探索应采用 无声、非介入的平台。
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made, farting around in the dark using these platforms, and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.	这个结论源自我几百次的潜水活动， 使用这些平台 在黑暗中四处观察 给我的印象是从潜水器中观察 比我使用远程遥控潜艇 能够看到更多的动物。
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.	但这可能只是因为潜水器具有更广阔的视角。
But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana, two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems.	另外我还发觉使用蒂伯龙潜艇比温塔娜潜艇 我观察到了更多的动物， 两种潜艇的视野相同 但采用了不同的推进系统。
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.	所以我怀疑这可能跟他们产生的噪音大小有关。
So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean, and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made.	因此我在海底安置了一个水听器， 然后我让每一个潜艇以同样的速度和距离经过 并记录它们发出的声音。
The Johnson Sea-Link -- -- which you can probably just barely hear here, uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.	约翰逊深海链接潜艇 ---（呼呼声噪音） 的声音可能只能被勉强听到， 它使用的是电动推进器 --- 非常、 非常安静。
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.	蒂伯龙潜艇使用的也是电动推进器。
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier.	它也相当安静，但是噪音要稍大一点。（稍大的呼呼声噪音）
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.	但目前能潜到最深的那些远程遥控潜艇大多使用的是液压驱动系统 它们的声音与温塔娜潜艇的一样。
I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.	我认为它的声音会吓跑很多的动物。
So for the deep sea squid hunt, I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera, and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue.	所以对于深海乌贼的探索， 我建议使用光诱饵， 将光源安装到一个没有推进器、没有发动机 的相机平台上， 只有一个电池驱动的相机， 并且唯一的光源来自红光 红光是大部分的深海生物无法看到的 它们适应了只能主要看到蓝色光。
That's visible to our eye, but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.	这对我们是可见的， 但它相当于深海中的红外线。
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa, could just be thrown off the back of the ship, attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line, it would just float around passively carried by the currents, and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure, which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly, because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.	所以这个我们称之为美杜沙的相机平台 可以直接从船后方扔到水中， 平台用长于610米的绳索连在船上， 它会被动地由洋流驱使在周围漂流， 深海中动物们唯一可看见的光 是光诱饵所发出的蓝色光， 我们将其称之为电子水母， 因为它的设计是模仿 常见的深海棕色水母 所发出的生物光。
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense.	棕色水母所发出的这种旋转光 被认为是一种生物光报警 和一种防御形式。
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish, but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.	电子水母能成为诱饵的原因 不是因为巨型乌贼捕食水母， 而是因为这种水母只会在它被捕食者咀嚼的时候 发出这种光， 水母唯一可以逃生的希望 是吸引到更大型捕食者的注意， 这样它就会攻击水母的捕食者 从而让水母有机会逃跑。
It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape, and a common form of defense in the deep sea.	这是呼唤帮助的尖叫，逃跑的最后希望， 也是深海中一种常见的防御形式。
The approach worked.	这个方法是有效的。
Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant, we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.	之前所有的探索活动都没能成功获得 巨型乌贼的影像资料， 而我们成功录了六段视频，第一次拍到巨型乌贼的视频时我们兴奋极了。
Edith Widder : Oh my God.	伊迪丝 · 维达： 哦，我的上帝。
Oh my God!	哦，我的上帝！
Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho!	你在跟我开玩笑吗？其他科学家： 哦呵呵！
That's just hanging there.	就在那里。
EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me, now you don't -- and we had four such teasing appearances, and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.	就像它在戏弄我们，跳着一种有趣的舞蹈 --- 现在你看到我，现在你又看不到我了 --- 我们先看到了四次这样的戏弄， 然后第五次时，它靠近了并完全震撼了我们。
Scientists: Ooh. Bang!	讲述人： 科学家们： 哦，砰 ！
Oh my God!	哦，我的上帝！
Whoa!	哇噻 ！
EW: The full monty.	完全的震撼。
What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it, which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.	让我真正震撼的是 它来到电子水母上来的方式 然后攻击电子水母旁边的巨大东西， 我认为它误认为电子水母上面的是水母的捕食者。
But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible.	但更令人难以置信的是 从特里顿潜水器里拍摄的镜头。
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used, a one-meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it, a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use, and I think it was this light that brought the giant in.	探索频道纪录片里没有提到的是 窪寺恒己博士使用的诱饵乌贼： 一只一米长的菱鳍乌贼 用延绳捕鱼的渔夫使用的乌贼挂钩 将光源附到它身上， 我认为正是这个光 吸引到了巨型乌贼。
Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.	现在你们看到的是 高敏感相机使用红色光录下的影像， 这是窪寺恒己博士在巨型乌贼出现在这里时所看到的全部。
And then he got so excited, he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better, and the giant didn't run away, so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible, bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video.	然后他变得如此兴奋 他打开了他的手电想看的更清楚些， 并且巨型乌贼没有逃跑， 因此他冒着风险打开了潜水器上的所有白色光， 把一种传说中的生物 从朦胧的历史变成了高清晰视频。
It was absolutely breathtaking, and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended, it would have been as tall as a two-story house.	它是如此的惊人， 如果这个生物将它的捕食触手 完全伸展开的话， 它会有两层楼那样高。
How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?	为什么如此巨大的东西 生活在我们的海洋但直到现在才被拍摄到呢？
We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.	我们目前只探索了海洋的大约5%。
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there, fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.	很多伟大的发现将会出现在水下， 代表数百万年的进化过程的伟大生物们 和很可能发现的生物活性化合物 这些发现可能会带给我们无法想象的好处。
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration.	然而相较于宇宙探索 我们只花了一小部分钱 用于海洋探索。
We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration, because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth.	我们需要一个类似美国国家航空航天局的组织来探索海洋， 因为我们需要探索和保护 地球上的我们的生命支持系统。
We need — thank you.	我们需要 --- 谢谢。
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.	探索是推动创新的引擎。
Innovation drives economic growth.	创新驱动着经济增长。
So let's all go exploring, but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away, or, as Mike deGruy once said, "If you want to get away from it all and see something you've never seen, or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen, get in a sub."	所以让我们一起去探索吧， 但是让我们要用一种不会吓跑动物们的方式， 或者如麦克· 德葛鲁曾经说过的： 如果你想要摆脱一切 并且看到一些你从未见过的东西， 或有绝佳的机会看到一些前所未见的东西， 那么下到潜水艇里吧。
He should have been with us for this adventure.	他本应和我们一起进行这次冒险。
We miss him.	我们缅怀他。
Okay, it's great to be back at TED.	再次回到TED演讲感觉真不错。
Why don't I just start by firing away with the video?	让我播放一段视频作为开场吧!
Okay, Glass, record a video.	男：眼镜, 开始录像。
This is it.	女：一切就绪，2分钟后上场。
Google "photos of tiger heads." Hmm.	唔！
You ready?	男4：准备好了吗？
You ready?	准备好了吗？
Right there.	女2：就这样！
Okay, Glass, take a picture.	眼镜，照张相。
Go!	男5：飞了!
Man 6: Holy [beep]!	男6：天啊！[哔]！

Man 7: After this bridge, first exit.	男7：过了这座桥后由第一个出口出去。
Man 8: Okay, A12, right there!	男8：好的，A12,就在那！
Man 9: Google, say "delicious" in Thai.	男9：眼镜，查查美味的用泰语怎么说。
Google Glass: อร่อยMan 9: Mmm, อร่อย.	谷歌眼镜：อร่อย 男9：嗯,อร่อย。
Woman 4: Google "jellyfish."	女4：眼镜，查一下水母。
Man 10: It's beautiful.	男10：太漂亮了！
Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince.	谢尔盖·布林：不好意思，我刚才在看尼日利亚王子发来的短信。
He needs help getting 10 million dollars.	他要我帮忙筹一千万美元。
I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well.	我很关注这样的事， 因为我们的公司就是这样成立的， 而且我们经营的还不错。
Though in all seriousness, this position that you just saw me in, looking down at my phone, that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.	不过话说回来， 也许刚才大家也注意到了 我低头看手机的姿势， 这是谷歌眼镜计划开展的一个原因。
Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life, how you want to connect to information.	因为我们终究会产生疑问 未来人们会用怎样的方式取代手机 联系家人和朋友， 你又想怎样获取信息。
Should it be by just walking around looking down?	不能总是边走边低头看手机吧?
But that was the vision behind Glass, and that's why we've created this form factor.	这是谷歌眼镜的理念的根源， 这也是我们将产品设计成眼镜形状的主要原因。
Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot, but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it.	我就不详细介绍谷歌眼镜的功能了， 但我想多讲一点 关于开发谷歌眼镜背后的动机。
In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you're out and about looking at your phone, it's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?	除了外出时边走边看手机 会潜移默化的将你隔绝在社会团体之外， 其实，你真的要这样对待你的身体吗？
You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass.	你站在那 触碰着 平淡无奇的手机屏幕，
You're just kind of moving around.	机械的移来移去。
So when we developed Glass, we thought really about, can we make something that frees your hands?	在开发谷歌眼镜时，我们真的在想， 我们是否可以设计出一种设备来解放我们的双手呢？
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there.	刚刚你们看到了视频中的人 做的一些事情。
They were all wearing Glass, and that's how we got that footage.	他们都戴上了谷歌眼镜， 所以才能拍摄到这种视频。
And also you want something that frees your eyes.	同时你也想解放你的眼睛。
That's why we put the display up high, out of your line of sight, so it wouldn't be where you're looking and it wouldn't be where you're making eye contact with people.	所以，我们将显示器放在稍高的位置， 它比你的视线稍高一点。 这样它就不会挡住你的视野、 不会妨碍你与人们的 眼神交流。
And also we wanted to free up the ears, so the sound actually goes through, conducts straight to the bones in your cranium, which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.	同时，我们还想解放人们的双耳， 所以声音会由这传过来， 直接传至头骨， 最初你可能会感觉有点怪，但慢慢就会习惯的。
And ironically, if you want to hear it better, you actually just cover your ear, which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works.	有点讽刺意味的是，如果你想听得更清楚， 你盖住耳朵就行， 这听起来很令人吃惊，但事实就是这样。
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all.	15年前在谷歌成立之初，我的初衷是： 最终人们不再 需要任何搜索引擎。
You'd just have information come to you as you needed it.	你可以随心所欲地想要什么信息就有什么信息。
And this is now, 15 years later, sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth.	而现在，15个年头过去了， 我想，我们最初的构想， 现在可以由谷歌眼镜来实现了， 它可以解决当你外出、在街上逛荡时、 轻松地、不需要低头看手机地与人交谈等等。
This project has lasted now, been just over two years.	到目前为止,这项计划已经开展了两年多。
We've learned an amazing amount.	我们得到一些不错的数据。
It's been really important to make it comfortable.	让使用者感到舒适真的很重要
So our first prototypes we built were huge.	我们制造的的第一批样品型号巨大。
It was like cell phones strapped to your head.	就像把手机绑在了头上。
It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.	很重，令人感到非常不舒服。
We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job, and then she almost ran away screaming.	我们不能让我们的工业设计师知道这事 直到她最终接受这份工作， 后来,她差不多是尖叫着跑掉了。
But we've come a long way.	但是我们已经取得了很大的进步。
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.	另一个意想不到的惊喜就是摄像功能。
Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all, but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family, my kids.	我们最初的原型机是完全没有摄像功能的， 但如果能捕获与家人和孩子相处的瞬间 那会是一件多么神奇的事啊。
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment.	我从未想到过会找到这样一款相机、 电话或其他什么东西来记录这些时刻。
And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device, that I also kind of have a nervous tic.	后来,我意识到,在试用这款设备的过程中， 我似乎产生了某种神经性反应，
The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that, but it's also kind of a nervous habit.	手机需要你低下头使用， 这也是一种神经性反映。
Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.	就像如果我过去吸烟,可能我现在还是要吸。
I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.	只要点支烟就好了，看起来会更酷。
You know, I'd be like -- But in this case, you know, I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to.	你知道,就像这样-- 但在这种情况下,我拿出手机 坐在那看,就像在处理什么 重要的事情。
But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away, be it email or social posts or whatnot, even though it wasn't really -- there's nothing really that important or that pressing.	但实际上,我眼睁睁的看着自己花费大量的时光 却只是使自己远离人群， 做着发邮件、发微博这类事情， 即使这些事不是真的-- 不是真的那么重要和紧迫。
And with this, I know I will get certain messages if I really need them, but I don't have to be checking them all the time.	用谷歌眼镜,我知道我会获得这些消息 如果我真的需要的话， 但是我不必总是查看他们。
Yeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more, doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video.	我很享受更多地去探索和了解这个世界 做更多正如你在视频中看到的疯狂的事情。
Thank you all very much.	谢谢大家。

Just kidding.	 开玩笑的
OK, so why is the problem accelerating?	那为何这问题越来越严重?
Part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use.	 一方面的原因是 很讽刺的 因为行业花了大把精力 为了使产品更易于使用

I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day.	我曾有幸在苹果的呼叫中心坐了一天
The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to.	接线员给了我一个旁听的耳麦
And the calls that -- you know how they say, "Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"	那些通话 -- 你知道他们是怎么说的 为保证服务质量，您的通话可能会被录音

I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right?	我称之为 运动器械原则. 人们喜欢将自己包围在 非必须的能力中
They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, "Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."	他们不需要数据库和网站 但是他们会想 好, 我要升级, 因为我或许有一天会需要它!

You only have so many design tools.	 你有那么多设计工具
You can do buttons; you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.	你可以做出按钮 滑块 弹出菜单 子菜单

And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complained about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically.	我们已进入了界面矩阵时代 有那么多特性和选项 你不得不做出2维的 垂直的和水平的. 你们都抱怨过 为什么Microsoft Word总是自动为列表加项目符号 为链接加下划线

So what is the answer?	因此我们做事要有限度 但答案在哪?
How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?	如何才能将所有这些特性以简单 智能的方式包装起来?
I believe in consistency with possible, real-world equivalents, trashcan folder when possible, label things mostly.	我信仰 保持一致 真实对等 使用回收站 使用标注
But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that?	但我请求在场的设计师们 打破这些规则 如果它们抵触了最大一条规则 那就是智能. 什么意思呢?
I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.	我会举一些例子 说明智能让某些事物 失去一致 但却更好

You have to scroll, like, seven screens-full to get to it.	你得要滚动7个屏才能找到它

The company put no new features. They just said, "We'll make the software work right." Right.	他们没有加入新特性 他们只是说 我们要让软件工作正确. 是的
Because for years people had bought this software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, "This version, we're not going to do anything but make sure it's darned accurate."	因为多年来人们买了这套软件 尝试使用 -- 发现只能达到95%的准确率 也就是20个单词里就有1个错的 于是人们把它收进抽屉 让那公司很郁闷 于是他们说 这个版本, 除了让它变得非常正确以外 我们不会做任何事.
And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread.	于是他们做到了. 这种把事做正确的信仰也在开始传播

Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.	跟你们在座的人一样,我也是一个幸运的人.
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.	我生于一个教育是很普遍的家庭
I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.	我是我们家里的第三代博士,我父母都是做学问的
In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.	童年时,我在我父亲的大学实验室里玩耍
So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities, which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.	因此毫无疑问我最后上了一些最好的大学 这样就为我打开一扇巨大的机会之门
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.	不幸的是,这世上大多数的人并没那么幸运
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa, education is just not readily accessible.	在世界的某些地方,比如说,在南非, 教育确实是很难得到
In South Africa, the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority.	在南非,教育系统是在种族隔离时期 为少数白人而建造的
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.	因此,如今对于那些想要并且应当得到 高质量的教育的人来说却没有足够的位置
That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year at the University of Johannesburg.	今年一月,教育机会上的贫乏导致了在 约翰尼斯堡大学的一个危机
There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process, and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration, thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long, hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.	在正常的录取工作下还有很多位置是空的, 而在他们准备打开这些位置 让别人来注册的前夜, 成千上万的人在门外排起了一英里长的队伍 希望自己是第一个进去得到这个位置的

But even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available, it might not be within reach.	即使在像美国这样的地区 尽管教育机会开放,但仍然有可能无法垂手可得
There has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care.	过去几年有很多人在讨论 医疗保险的价格上升
What might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate, for a total of 559 percent since 1985.	对于人们来说可能不明显的是,在这段时间里 高等教育的消费支出 几乎在以两倍的速度增长 自1985年来上涨了559%
This makes education unaffordable for many people.	这使得很多人无法负担教育费用
Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education, the doors of opportunity might not open.	即使对于很多有办法得到高等教育的人, 机会的大门也许不会向他们打开
Only a little over half of recent college graduates in the United States who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education.	只有仅仅过半的在美国 接受高等教育的大学研究生 实际工作在要求研究生学位的岗位上
This, of course, is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions, but for many others, they do not get the value for their time and their effort.	当然,这对于从高等院校毕业的学生 来说肯定不是真的 但是对于其他人来说就是,他们没有得到 他们付出的时间和努力所带来的价值
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article, captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.	Tom Friedman,在他最近的纽约时报的文章中（以他人所不能的方式） 抓住了在我们在努力背后的精神
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.	他说巨大的突破是在当突然可能的事情 满足急切需要的事情时发生的
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.	我已经说了什么是急切需要的了
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.	现在让我讲讲什么是突然可能的
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big Stanford classes, each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.	这个其实已经被斯坦福大学三个大课 所展示了 每种课都是100000人以上在听
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes, the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder Andrew Ng.	因此为了理解这一点,我们看看其中一个 由我一个同事和Andrew Ng教授 共同创办的机器研究课程
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.	Andrew是教授斯坦福的大课程的
It's a Machine Learning class, and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.	是机器研究课程 每回都有400多人参加
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public, it had 100,000 people registered.	而当Andrew把这门课传播到公众当中, 100000人注册了
So to put that number in perspective, for Andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a Stanford class, he would have to do that for 250 years.	就这样来说吧, 为了让他通过教授斯坦福课程来 影响到那么多人 他得用250年时间
Of course, he'd get really bored.	当然,他肯定会无聊死
So, having seen the impact of this, Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up, to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.	因此在见识到这个事情的影响之后 Andrew和我决定我们得做大这件事 去尽可能的为更多人带来最优质的教育
So we formed Coursera, whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free.	因此我们创建了Coursera 目地是为了让人们从最好的大学、最好的导师 中学到最好的课程 而且免费提供给世界各地的人
We currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines, and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like.	我们目前在平台上有43个课程 来自4所大学,有各种各样的学科 让我给大家看看这个网站 大概是什么样子吧
Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.	Robert Ghrist: 欢迎来到微积分课程
Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.	Ezekiel Emanuel: 有5千万人没有保险

Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.	Daphne Koller: 这就是你选出来的硬币,这是两次投掷的结果
Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...	Andrew Ng: 因此在大规模的机器研究中,我们希望得出计算型的....
It turns out, maybe not surprisingly, that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free.	结果呢,可能不是很令人吃惊, 学生们都喜欢免费从最好的大学得到 最好的课程内容
Since we opened the website in February, we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.	自从我们在二月创建了这个网站后, 我们现在已经有来自190个国家的640000名学生
We have 1.5 million enrollments, 6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.	我们有150万次的申请 15个已经开讲的课程里的600万个小测验 已被提交,1400万的视频已被观看
But it's not just about the numbers, it's also about the people.	不过这不仅跟数字有关 还跟人有关
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it.	不管是来自印度的一个小镇 绝不会得到斯坦福水准的 课程,而且也无法支付那些课程的 Akash
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.	或者是两个孩子的单身妈妈 想在家里学点技能 然后回去完成她的硕士学位的Jenny
Or Ryan, who can't go to school, because his immune deficient daughter can't be risked to have germs come into the house, so he couldn't leave the house.	还是Ryan, 他不能上学 因为他的无抵抗力的女儿 使他必须待在家里确保没有细菌 进入房间
I'm really glad to say -- recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan -- that this story had a happy ending.	我很高兴地可以说-- 最近,我们在与Ryan联系 最后这个故事有了一个很好的结局
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left -- is doing much better now, and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.	Shannon宝贝--你可以从左边看到她 现在变得好多了 而且Ryan由于上了我们提供的一些课,他得到了一份工作
So what made these courses so different?	那到底是什么使得这些课程与众不同呢?
After all, online course content has been available for a while.	毕竟,在线课程已经有很长一段时间了
What made it different was that this was real course experience.	但不同的是这些都是真正的上课体验
It started on a given day, and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments.	从固定的一天开始, 然后学生每周必须去观看视频 然后做家庭作业
And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade, with a real deadline.	而这些都是真正的家庭作业 有真正的成绩和截止日期
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.	你看以看到截止日期和使用情况的图像
These are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon.	这些顶端表明 耽搁是一个全球现象
At the end of the course, the students got a certificate.	在每门课结束后 学生们会得到一个证书
They could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job, and we know many students who did.	他们可以把证书给雇主看 然后得到一个更好的工作 而我们知道很多学生都这么做了
Some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit.	很多学生拿着证书 给了他们在读的院校 索要真正的大学学分
So these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort.	因此这些学生为他们所付出的时间和努力 的确在得到一些有意义的东西
Let's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses.	让我们谈谈在课程里面一些 部分内容吧
The first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format, you can break away from, for example, the monolithic one-hour lecture.	第一个就是当你 摆脱了在教室里的束缚 和为在线课程明确地设计内容的时候 你可以不再使用,比如说 单调的一小时讲座的模式
You can break up the material, for example, into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes, each of which represents a coherent concept.	你可以将材料,比如说, 分成8到12分钟的短的单元 每一个都代表一个连贯的概念
Students can traverse this material in different ways, depending on their background, their skills or their interests.	学生可以用不同方式来反复研究这个材料 取决于他们的背景,技能,和兴趣
So, for example, some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have.	比如说,一些学生会从 一点点的准备材料中收益 但其他学生可能已经了解了
Of course, we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.	当然,我们都知道作为教育者, 学生们干坐着看视频是学不到什么东西的.
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it.	或许这努力当中最大的部分 是需要让这些学生通过 材料的练习去 真正的理解课程
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.	有很多研究表明这一方面的重要性,
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example, demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice, where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions.	比如说,去年在科学杂志上出现的一篇, 表明了即使是简单的重复小练习 只需要学生重复 他们刚刚学到的东西 会带来很大的提高效果 不管是在各种成绩测试 还是其他教育性的打断
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform, as well as other forms of practice in many ways.	我们在尝试在平台中去建立一个回顾性的测试 以及其他各种方式的练习
For example, even our videos are not just videos.	比如说,我们的视频不光是简单的视频
Every few minutes, the video pauses and the students get asked a question.	每过几分钟,视频就会暂停下来 然后学生必须回答一个问题
SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting, status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.	SP: ...这四样东西,预期理论,双曲贴现, 现状偏差,基准利率偏差.这些都被很好地记录下来
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.	因此他们都是从理性的行为中很好地记录下来的偏差
So here the video pauses, and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.	在这视频就暂停了 然后学生需要在方框里输入答案 然后提交.显然这些学生在走神儿
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.	然后现在视频才继续进行到讲座的下一部分
This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class, but when I ask that kind of a question in class, 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said, 15 percent are zoned out on Facebook, and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it, and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer.	这是一种我作为一名导师 可能会在课堂上问的简单的问题 不过当我在真正的课堂上问的时候, 80%的学生 还在琢磨我前面说的话 15%的学生都沉浸在Facebook里, 然后坐在前排的聪明蛋 直接在其他人还没机会思考的之前 一口报出正确答案. 然后作为老师我极度满足 竟然有人知道答案
And so the lecture moves on before, really, most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.	因此我就继续往下讲了,所以你可以看到, 大多数学生只是注意到了老师问了个问题...
Here, every single student has to engage with the material.	在这,每个学生 必须与材料接洽
And of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story.	当然不光是这些回顾性的 小问题
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions, and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions.	应该有更多的有意义的练习性问题 而且还应该在那些问题上 对学生有所回馈
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 TAs?	那如果没有10000助教的话, 怎么样才能批改100000名学生的作业呢?
The answer is, you need to use technology to do it for you.	答案是,你得使用科技 来帮助你
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way, and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.	幸运的是,科技已经很发达了 我们现在可以批改各种各样的作业
In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video, we can also grade math, mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations.	不光是选择题 还有那种你在视频中看到的简答题 我们还可以批改数学或者数学表达式 以及数学词源
We can grade models, whether it's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.	我们还可以批改模型, 不管是在商业课中的金融模型 还是在科学或工程课上的物理模型 我们还能批改一些比较复杂的编程作业
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple but fairly visual.	让我给大家看一个比较简单的 不过清晰可见
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class, and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image.	这是斯坦福的计算机科学101课程 学生应当去更正模糊的 红色区域
They're typing their program into the browser, and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.	他们在浏览器里直接输入自己的程序 你可以看到他们没有弄对,自由女神还没来拯救他们
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that, and they can move on to the next assignment.	于是学生又试了一次,现在他们弄对了,然后他们就被告知 可以移动到下一个题目了
This ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you're right or wrong is really essential to student learning.	这种能够和材料积极互动以及 被告知自己正确与否的能力 对于学生学习是至关重要的
Now, of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses.	不过,当然我们还无法批改 所有种类的作业
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.	确切地讲,我们缺少一种批判性思维的工作 这种思维在人文类,社会科学,商业和 其他领域都是极其关键的
So we tried to convince, for example, some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.	因此我们尝试去,比如说, 让人文学的教职工相信 多项选择题不是那么坏的一个策略
That didn't go over really well.	不过效果却不是很好
So we had to come up with a different solution.	因此我们必须想出另外一个办法
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.	最后的解决方案是学生之间互批
It turns out that previous studies show, like this one by Saddler and Good, that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades.	之前的研究表明 比如Saddler和Good做的这个研究, 同伴互批是一个对于提供可复写成绩的 十分有效的策略
It was tried only in small classes, but there it showed, for example, that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.	这曾经只在小课堂中用过, 不过这它显示了,比如说, 这些学生批改的在Y轴上的分数 实际上跟老师批改的 在X轴上的分数较为吻合
What's even more surprising is that self-grades, where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incentivize them properly so they can't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.	更惊奇的是,自我批改 就是让学生自己给自己批改作业 只要你合适地激励他们, 确保他们不能随随便便就给自己一个满分- 甚至跟老师批改的成绩更加吻合
And so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale, and is also a useful learning strategy for the students, because they actually learn from the experience.	因此这是一个很有效的策略 对于大规模作业批改来说 并且还是个对于学生来说有用的学习策略 因为他们实际上从这段经验中学到了东西
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised, where tens of thousands of students are grading each other's work, and quite successfully, I have to say.	因此我们现在就有设计出的最大的同龄人批改线 这当中成千上万的学生 在互相批改作业 而且我必须说,这很成功
But this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems.	不过这不只是学生们 在客厅干坐着解决问题
Around each one of our courses, a community of students had formed, a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor.	在我们的每一个课程 一个团队的学生形成了了 一个全球性的社区 都有一个共同的智力目标
What you see here is a self-generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course, where they have put themselves on a world map, and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.	你在这里看到一张自动生成的地图 显示在普林斯顿社会学101课程的学生 从世界各地而来 你看以看到这种努力的全球性延伸
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.	学生在这些课程中以不同的方式进行合作
First of all, there was a question and answer forum, where students would pose questions, and other students would answer those questions.	第一,我们有一个问答平台 学生可以提出问题, 然后其他学生可以回答问题
And the really amazing thing is, because there were so many students, it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o'clock in the morning, somewhere around the world, there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem.	最惊奇的是 因为学生太多了 这意味着即使有学生在凌晨3点 提出一个问题 在世界上的某个地方 总有人会醒着 在同一问题上工作
And so, in many of our courses, the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.	因此,在许多课程中, 在问答平台上的回答时间中间值 只有22分钟
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.	这比我对我斯坦福学生的服务要好得多
And you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community, they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.	你还可以从学生的证明书里看到 学生实际上发现 因为这个巨大的线上社区 学生其实可以以多种方式进行互动 这其实比在一个教室里的收获还多
Students also self-assembled, without any kind of intervention from us, into small study groups.	学生们还都组装自己 我们对此不进行任何干扰 组织形成学习小组
Some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.	这里面有些是物理学习小组 来研究地理条件限制 他们每周见面去研究一系列问题
This is the San Francisco study group, but there were ones all over the world.	这是旧金山学习小组 不过这些人都来自世界各地
Others were virtual study groups, sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines, and on the bottom left there, you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures.	其他都是实质上的小组 有时候通过语言和文化来划分 在左下方这里 你看以看到我们多文化的学习小组 人们直率地去和有其他文化背景的人 主动交流
There are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework.	这种框架的构建就带来一些 巨大的机会
The first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning.	首先它拥有带给我们 前所未有的 在了解人类学习方面的潜力
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.	因为我们这里能收集到的数据是独一无二的
You can collect every click, every homework submission, every forum post from tens of thousands of students.	你可以收集到每一次点击,每一次作业提交 每一份来自成千上万学生的论坛帖子
So you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data-driven mode, a transformation that, for example, has revolutionized biology.	因此你可以将人类学习的模式 从理论假设的形式 变为以数据为基础的形式, 这是一种,比方说,已经变革生物科学的转型
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions like, what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not?	你可以通过这些数据去了解最基本的问题 比如说,哪些是好的学习策略 哪些是有效的而哪些是无效的?
And in the context of particular courses, you can ask questions like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them?	而在特定的几个课程背景中, 你可以问像这样的问题: 有哪些误解是十分常见的, 如何需要我们帮助学生去更正它们?
So here's an example of that, also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.	这儿有一个例子 同样是从Andrew的机器研究课程来的
This is a distribution of wrong answers to one of Andrew's assignments.	这是对于Andrew其中一项作业 所有错误答案的分布
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers, so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.	答案都是数对 因此你可以在二维图象里画出来
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.	每一个你看到的小叉叉就是一个不同的错误答案
The big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer.	在左上方的大叉叉 指的是有2000个学生 得出了一样的错误答案
Now, if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer, you would never notice.	现在，如果有两个学生在100人的课堂里 给出了同样的错误答案 你肯定发现不了
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer, it's kind of hard to miss.	不过当2000人都给出同样的错误答案 就很难看不到了
So Andrew and his students went in, looked at some of those assignments, understood the root cause of the misconception, and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket, which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.	因此Andrew和他的学生 分析了一些作业 然后找到了误解的根本原因 然后他们创建了一条专门针对 提供错误答案学生的 特别信息 这样一来这些学生 就可以得到一种个性化的回馈 告诉他们如何更有效地更正误解
So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers.	因此这种个性化的东西是通过 利用大规模数据的优势来创建的
Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well, because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem.	个性化估计也是这儿 最大的机会之一 因为它提供给我们一种 解决30年未决的问题的潜力
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984, posed what's called the 2 sigma problem, which he observed by studying three populations.	教育研究家Benjamin Bloom在1984年 提出了叫做2 sigma问题 他通过学习三种人群观察到的
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.	第一是在以授课为基础的课堂中学习的人群
The second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture-based classroom, but with a mastery-based approach, so the students couldn't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.	第二是使用标准的以授课为基础的课堂学习的人群 第二是使用标准的以授课为基础的课堂学习的人群 但是有一个旨在精通的方法 因此学生必须熟练掌握前一个话题才能继续学习下一个 因此学生必须熟练掌握前一个话题才能继续学习下一个
And finally, there was a population of students that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.	最后一个就是 在导师一对一课程中受教育的人群
The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation, or sigma, in achievement scores better than the standard lecture-based class, and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma improvement in performance.	旨在精通的人群是完全标准差 或者sigma,他们在成就分数方面 比标准的以授课为基础的班要好得多 而导师一对一的课程在表现提高方面 就有2个sigma
To understand what that means, let's look at the lecture-based classroom, and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.	为了了解这意味着什么, 让我们看看以授课为基础的课堂吧 我们把中位数当做一个门槛
So in a lecture-based class, half the students are above that level and half are below.	因此在以授课为基础的课堂中 是一半对一半
In the individual tutoring instruction, 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.	在导师一对一授课中, 98%都达到了门槛
Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average.	想象一个如果我们教的学生 98%都在平均标准之上
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.	因此,就有这个2 sigma的问题
Because we cannot afford, as a society, to provide every student with an individual human tutor.	因为我们作为一个社会不可能去给 每一个学生都提供一个一对一的导师
But maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone.	但是我们可以提供给他们每人一台电脑 或者一部智能手机
So the question is, how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve, to the right side with the green curve?	因此问题是,我们如何应该使用科技 去推动我们摆脱左边蓝色的图像, 最后到达右边绿色的图像呢?
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer, because a computer doesn't get tired of showing you the same video five times.	通过电脑来实现精通的目地是很简单的, 因为电脑对于放5遍同样的视频来说, 从来不嫌累
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times, we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.	而且多次批改同样的作业也不会累 我们在很多我举的例子当中也看到了
And even personalization is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of, whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.	而且甚至我们也看到 个性化的设计在逐渐开始发展 不管是通过课程中个性化的轨道 或是一些我们给大家展示的个性化反馈
So the goal here is to try and push, and see how far we can get towards the green curve.	因此我们的目标是尝试看看 我们能够多接近那个绿色的图像
So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?	好吧,那如果这个这么好,大学是不是过时了?
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.	嗯,马克吐温显然这么想,
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either."	他说:大学是一个教授的笔记 直接成为学生的笔记, 并且都没有经过两者大脑的地方.
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.	不过我真不敢与马克吐温苟同
I think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on.	我认为他在抱怨的不是大学 而是以授课为基础的课堂模式 因为这些模式在大学太流行了
So let's go back even further, to Plutarch, who said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting."	那让我们在往回看看,回到Plutarch 他说:思想不是一个需要填充的容器, 而是需要点燃的木头.
And maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students' minds with content by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity, their imagination and their problem-solving skills by actually talking with them.	因此或许我们应该在 通过授课填充学生脑袋的大学少花点时间, 而应当多花些时间点燃他们的创造力 他们的想象力和解决问题的能力 通过积极与他们交流来实现
So how do we do that?	那么我们怎么做呢?
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.	我们通过主动的学习来实现
So there's been many studies, including this one, that show that if you use active learning, interacting with your students in the classroom, performance improves on every single metric -- on attendance, on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test.	有很多研究表明,包括这个, 如果你使用积极学习法的话, 就是与你的学生在课堂上互动, 他们的表现会在每个单位不断提高, 在出勤,在参与度,在学习方面 尤其在被一个标准测试衡量的时候
You can see, for example, that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment.	你可以看到,比如说,成就分数 在这个实验中几乎都翻倍了
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.	或许这就是我们如何应当度过大学时光的办法
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free, what would that do?	因此总结一下,如果我们能免费向世上的每个人提供高质量的教育 因此总结一下,如果我们能免费向世上的每个人提供高质量的教育 那么会怎么样了?
Three things.	会是这样:
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right, where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves, their families and their communities.	首先教育变成了人类最基本的权利 世界上所有有能力和积极性的人 世界上所有有能力和积极性的人 都可以得到他们想需要的技能 为他们自己,他们家人, 他们的社区追求更好的生活 为他们自己,他们家人, 他们的社区追求更好的生活
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.	第二,这会使终生学习成为可能
It's a shame that for so many people, learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.	对于很多人,在高中或者大学结束后就再也不学了是惭愧的事 对于很多人,在高中或者大学结束后就再也不学了是惭愧的事
By having this amazing content be available, we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted, whether it's just to expand our minds or it's to change our lives.	通过这样一个项目 每当我们想要的时候,我们可以学一些新知识 每当我们想要的时候,我们可以学一些新知识 不管是用来拓展我们的思维 还是改变我们的生活
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation, because amazing talent can be found anywhere.	最后,这个项目会带来一股创新潮 因为哪里都能找到惊人的天赋
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.	或许下一个爱因斯坦或者乔布斯 就住在非洲一个偏远的小镇上
And if we could offer that person an education, they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us.	而且如果我们能为那个人提供一份教育 他们可能会想出下一个极好的主意 使我们的世界变得更美好
Thank you very much.	非常感谢
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk.	我要跟大家讲一点 关于我的TEDx休斯敦演讲的事
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life.	在演讲之后的那个早上 是我这辈子经历过最糟糕 最脆弱的宿醉
And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days.	而且我有三天都 足不出户
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.	第一次出门是去见个朋友一起吃午饭
And when I walked in, she was already at the table.	当我进去的时候，她已经在餐桌上了
And I sat down, and she said, "God, you look like hell."	然后我坐下，然后她说： 天啊，你看起来真颓
I said, "Thanks.	我说：谢谢啊，我觉得 -- 我都不能正常思考了。
I feel really -- I'm not functioning."	
And she said, "What's going on?"	然后她说：什么情况？
And I said, "I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability.	然后我说：我刚刚告诉了 500个人， 说我成为了一个 避免脆弱的研究者。
And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data, as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living, I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown.	而当我的数据表明 保持脆弱 是全心投入生活 所不可或缺的基础时 我告诉这500个人 我崩溃了
I had a slide that said Breakdown.	我放了张幻灯片写着崩溃
At what point did I think that was a good idea?"	我是搭了哪根弦会觉得这是个好点子呢？
And she said, "I saw your Talk live-streamed.	然后她说：我看了你演讲的现场视频了
It was not really you.	那不太像你
It was a little different than what you usually do.	跟你平常有点不一样
But it was great."	不过真的很棒
And I said, "This can't happen.	然后我说： 我得阻止这个
YouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.	上YouTube，他们要把这个放到YouTube上去
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people."	那就是600人、700人的事了
And she said, "Well, I think it's too late."	然后她说：这样啊，我看来不及了
And I said, "Let me ask you something."	于是我说：问你一下
And she said, "Yeah."	她说：好
And I said, "Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb?"	然后我说：你还记得在大学时代 特别疯特别傻的那时候吗？
And she said, "Yeah."	然后她说：记得呀
And I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?	于是我说：还记得我们有时候 给前男友的答录机留了一段特别糟的话，
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?"	然后我们不得不撬开他宿舍的门， 然后把那段话抹掉的事吗？
And she goes, "Uh ...	然后她说：呃。
no."	不记得
So of course, the only thing I could think of to say at that point was, "Yeah, me neither.	所以当然了，我也只能说， 哦，我也没有过
That ... me neither."	那什么...我也没有
And I'm thinking to myself, "Brene, what are you doing?	然后我对自己说： 布琳，你在干什么？
What are you doing?	 你在干吗呢？
Why did you bring this up?	你怎么会提这个？
Have you lost your mind?	 你昏了头了吗？
Your sisters would be perfect for this."	你的姐妹这方面是很完美的。
So I looked back up and she said, "Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube?"	看我回过神来于是她说： 你不会是真的想撬门进去 在他们上传到YouTube之前 把视频偷出来吧？
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."	我说：我就是想了一小下
She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."	她说：你就是史上最糟糕的脆弱者的榜样
And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic, but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.	然后我看着她说了一些 当时看有点戏剧性， 现在看更像是预言的话。
I said, "If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000, my life is over."	我说： 如果500变成1000 或者2000， 我就死定了
I had no contingency plan for four million.	我压根就没想过四百万点击率是什么情况
And my life did end when that happened.	于是我的生活真的完了
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself, and that was that, as much as I would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world, there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small, staying right under the radar.	而或许其中最困难的 就是我发现了自身纠结的那一部分， 那就是： 一方面我会因为 无法把我的工作成果展现给公众而失落 而另一方面我又非常努力的 做到不引人注目， 隐藏在公众的视线之下。
But I want to talk about what I've learned.	但是我想讲一下我所学到的。
There's two things that I've learned in the last year.	在过去的一年我学到两件事，
The first is vulnerability is not weakness.	第一件事， 脆弱不是弱点。
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.	并且这种错误理解 是非常危险的。
Let me ask you honestly -- and I'll give you this warning, I'm trained as a therapist, so I can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly, when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable, think, "God, vulnerability's weakness. This is weakness?"	我想诚恳的请问大家 -- 先给个提醒， 作为一个受过专业训练的治疗师， 我知道你们会感觉不太自在 -- 所以你们只要举手就很好了 -- 坦诚地讲有多少人， 当你们想到做一些脆弱的事 或说一些脆弱的话的时候， 会觉得：天啊，脆弱就是软弱，这就是软弱 ？
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?	有多少人认为脆弱和软弱是一回事？
The majority of people.	大部分人
Now let me ask you this question: This past week at TED, how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here, thought it was pure courage?	现在我们这样来问： 在TED刚过去的这周， 有多少人，当你们看到脆弱的时候， 认为那是纯粹的勇气？
Vulnerability is not weakness.	脆弱不是软弱。
I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty.	我把脆弱定义为： 情感的风险、 流露，以及不确定性。
It fuels our daily lives.	它驱动我们的日常生活。
And I've come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen, to be honest.	并且我已经达成了这样一种信念 -- 我已经研究这个课题12年了 -- 那就是，脆弱 是对我们的勇气 最精确的衡量 -- 保留脆弱，开放自我， 保持真诚。
One of the weird things that's happened is, after the TED explosion, I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies.	有个奇怪的事就是 在TED这个演讲轰动之后， 我收到全国各地的很多邀请 -- 从学校家长会 到世界500强的公司。
And so many of the calls went like this, "Hey, Dr. Brown. We loved your TEDTalk.	很多电话都是这样的： 嗨，布朗博士，我们喜欢您的TED演讲。
We'd like you to come in and speak.	我们想邀请您来讲一讲。
We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame."	但有一件事 希望您不要提到脆弱或者羞耻。
What would you like for me to talk about?	那你们想让我讲什么？
There's three big answers.	有三个主要的答案。
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector: innovation, creativity and change.	这些老实讲，主要是来自商业领域的 革新，创造 以及改变。
So let me go on the record and say, vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.	那么就让我在这里 当众声明： 脆弱是革新、 创造以及改变的发源地。
To create is to make something that has never existed before.	创造就是要制造出 前所未有的东西。
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.	没有什么比这个更脆弱的了。
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability.	适应改变的能力 全都和脆弱有关。
The second thing, in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage, the second thing I learned is this: We have to talk about shame.	第二件事， 在彻底的理解脆弱和勇气 之间的关系之外， 我所学到的第二件事就是： 我们必须得谈论羞耻。
And I'm going to be really honest with you.	我将对大家非常坦诚。
When I became a "vulnerability researcher" and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk -- and I'm not kidding.	当我成为了一个脆弱研究员 并且因为那个TED演讲而成为焦点之后 -- 我不是在开玩笑
I'll give you an example.	我给大家讲个例子。
About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.	大概3个月前，当我在一家体育用品店 买泳镜啊护腿啊这些 父母买给孩子的东西的时候，
About from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear: "Vulnerability TED!	从大概100英尺远，我听到一个声音： 脆弱TED！
Vulnerability TED!"	脆弱TED！
I'm a fifth generation Texan.	我是第五代的德州人
Our family motto is "Lock and load."	我们的家族格言是：子弹上膛，准备战斗
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher.	我不是天生来研究脆弱的
So I'm like, just keep walking, she's on my six.	所以我差不多就这样， 就一直走，她在我6点钟方向。
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"	然后我听到：脆弱TED！
I turn around, I go, "Hi."	我转过身，说：嗨
She's right here and she said, "You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown."	她就在这儿，然后她说： 你就是那个崩溃了的羞耻的研究员
At this point parents are, like, pulling their children close.	这时侯 父母们都拉紧他们的孩子
"Look away."	看别处
And I'm so worn out at this point in my life, I look at her and I actually say, "It was a frickin' spiritual awakening."	这一刻我简直太无语了， 我看着她脱口而出的是： 我靠，那是一次灵魂的觉醒。
And she looks back and does this, "I know."	
And she said, "We watched your TEDTalk in my book club.	然后她看着我就这样， 了解
Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'The Breakdown Babes.'"	然后她说： 我们在读书俱乐部看了你的TED演讲。
And she said, "Our tagline is: 'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'" You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.	然后读了你的书 之后我们就给自己改名字叫 崩溃辣妹 然后她说：我们的标语是： 我们正在分崩离析而且这感觉棒极了 你们就能想象 我在教师会上是个什么情形了
So when I became Vulnerability TED, like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind, because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.	所以当我成了 脆弱TED 像个玩具公仔 比如忍者芭比，只不过我叫 脆弱TED 我想，我该把羞耻感研究放一放了 因为在正式开始谈和写作关于脆弱之前 我花了6年的时间来研究羞耻感
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it.	我当时想，谢天谢地，因为羞耻是个这么可怕的话题 没人想谈论它
It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.	它是让飞机上搭讪的人闭嘴的最好方法
"What do you do?"	您是做什么的？
"I study shame." "Oh."	 我学习羞耻 哦
And I see you.	而且我看透你
But in surviving this last year, I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule, but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya.	但是在过去一年的挣扎中 我被一个基本守则所提醒着 -- 不是做研究的守则 而是基于我所受教育的 一种道义上的驱使 -- 你只能打好手里已经有的牌
And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability.	我并没有通过研究脆弱而学习到 勇气、创造、革新 以及脆弱。
I learned about these things from studying shame.	我是通过研究羞耻 而学到这些。
And so I want to walk you in to shame.	因此我想带大家 走进羞耻感。
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul.	荣格学派把羞耻称作是 灵魂的沼泽地
And we're going to walk in.	而我们就即将踏入。
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there.	目的并不是走进去 造个房子住下来。
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around.	而是穿上胶鞋 穿过去并找出可以走的路。
Here's why.	这是因为
We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country, and I think globally, around race, right?	我们已经听到最迫切的呼吁 要在这个国家进行一场对话 而且我想全世界都是这样， 一场围绕种族问题的对话，是吧？
Yes?	对吗？
We heard that.	我们听到了
Yes?	对吗？
Cannot have that conversation without shame, because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.	不谈羞耻就不会有这场对话 因为谈种族不可能不谈到特权
And when people start talking about privilege, they get paralyzed by shame.	而当人们谈到特权的时候， 他们就被羞耻感所淹没了
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery, which is have a checklist.	我们听说了一个简单有效的方法 来降低手术中病人的死亡率， 就是准备一个事项清单。
You can't fix that problem without addressing shame, because when they teach those folks how to suture, they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful.	不解决羞耻感就不会有这个方案， 因为当他们教那些人如何缝合的时候， 他们也同时教会那些人如何编织自己的自尊 直到认为自己是全能的。
And all-powerful folks don't need checklists.	而全能的人是不需要事项清单的。
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here.	这里我不得不把这位TED同伴的名字写下来 以防止弄错
Myshkin Ingawale, I hope I did right by you.	梅什金·英格瓦莱 希望我拼对了
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.	在这儿的第一天我见到TED的同伴们。
And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily.	他站起来解释 是什么驱使他创造某种 帮助检测贫血的技术 以防止病人没必要的死亡
And he said, "I saw this need.	他说：我看到了这个需要，
So you know what I did?	你猜怎么？
I made it."	我做了一个
And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"	于是全场爆发出掌声，真棒！
And he said, "And it didn't work.	然后他继续说：但是它不管用
And then I made it 32 more times, and then it worked."	然后我又试了32次， 然后它成了。
You know what the big secret about TED is?	你知道TED最大的秘密是什么吗？
I can't wait to tell people this.	我等不及想告诉大家
I guess I'm doing it right now.	我现在就在说吧
This is like the failure conference.	这就像是一个失败者的会议。
No, it is.	不，它就是。
You know why this place is amazing?	为什么这地方很神奇？
Because very few people here are afraid to fail.	因为这里几乎没有人 是害怕失败的。
And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.	而站在这个舞台上的还没有人，据我所知，是未曾失败过的。
I've failed miserably, many times.	我曾经败的很惨，很多次。
I don't think the world understands that because of shame.	我觉得大部分人不明白这个道理 出于羞耻感。
There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt.	去年有这么一段话对我帮助很大 来自西奥多·罗斯福
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.	很多人把它引用为竞技场里的男人。
And it goes like this: "It is not the critic who counts.	它是这样的： 荣誉不属于那些批评家。
It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles.	也不是那些坐在一旁 对真正的做事者指指点点 品头论足的人。
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat.	荣誉归于竞技场里的男人 他的面容 被尘土、鲜血和汗水所模糊。
But when he's in the arena, at best he wins, and at worst he loses, but when he fails, when he loses, he does so daring greatly."	但当他站在竞技场内， 至好他能获胜， 至差他会失败。 但是当他失败时，当他输掉时， 他失败得如此的无所畏惧。
And that's what this conference, to me, is about.	这就是它带给我的意义
That's what life is about, about daring greatly, about being in the arena.	关于生命的意义，关于无所畏惧， 关于站到竞技场上。
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door, and you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this," shame is the gremlin who says, "Uh, uh.	当你走上竞技场把手放到门上， 你想：我要进去，我要做这件事 羞耻就是一个小精灵 在你耳边说：啊哦，
You're not good enough.	你不够好。
You never finished that MBA.	你从没拿到MBA学位。
Your wife left you.	你妻子离开你了。
I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg, he was in Sing Sing.	我知道你爸爸不是在卢森堡 他是在新新 。
I know those things that happened to you growing up.	我知道你从小到大的糗事。
I know you don't think that you're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.	我知道你也清楚自己不够漂亮 或者不够聪明或者不够有才或者不够强壮。
I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO."	我知道即使你当上了CFO你爸爸也从来没在意过。
Shame is that thing.	羞耻就是这样。
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say, "I'm going to do this," we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing, 99 percent of the time is who?	而如果我们能平静下来，走进去 对自己说：我要做这件事 我们抬起头 看到那些指指点点嘲笑的人， 99%的时候是谁？
Us.	是我们自己。
Shame drives two big tapes -- "never good enough" and, if you can talk it out of that one, "who do you think you are?"	羞耻始终播放着这样两句话 -- 永远不够好 然后，如果你能跨过这一层， 你以为你是谁啊？
The thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt.	需要理解的是羞耻不是内疚。
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.	羞耻专注于自身，内疚专注于行为。
Shame is "I am bad."	羞耻是我很糟
Guilt is "I did something bad."	内疚是我做了很糟的事
How many of you, if you did something that was hurtful to me, would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"	在座的有多少人， 如果你们做了一些伤害我的事， 会愿意说：对不起，我犯了个错误？
How many of you would be willing to say that?	有多少人会愿意这么说？
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.	内疚：对不起，我犯了个错误。
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.	羞耻：对不起，我就是个错误。
There's a huge difference between shame and guilt.	羞耻和内疚之间有巨大的差别。
And here's what you need to know.	大家需要知道这些。
Shame is highly, highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence, aggression, bullying, suicide, eating disorders.	羞耻是和下面这些行为高度相关的 吸毒，抑郁，暴力，侵略 欺凌，自杀，饮食失调。
And here's what you even need to know more.	而更需要知道的是，
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.	内疚，则是恰恰相反。
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive.	用我们已经做过或做错的事 来拷问理想的自己 这种程度是可以非常灵活的。
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.	它不舒服，但是是可以调节的。
The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender.	关于羞耻还需要知道的另一件事 就是它是完全被性别所导向的
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris, it's going to feel the same.	当羞耻感涌上我的心头和克里斯的心头， 那感觉都是一样的。
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.	这里每个人都知道那是一种什么滋味。
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy.	我们可以很确定的说唯一不会感到羞耻的人 就是不能建立关系 或者不能感同身受的人。
Which means, yes, I have a little shame; no, I'm a sociopath.	意思就是，是，我有一点羞耻； 不，我只是不爱交际。
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.	那么我就会认为，是，你有一点羞耻感。
Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender.	羞耻的感受对于男人和女人都是一样的， 但却根据性别有不同的处理方式。
For women, the best example I can give you is Enjoli the commercial: "I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine.	对于女人， 我能想到的最好的例子就是 恩乔丽 （香水品牌） 那个广告 我可以打着电话把衣服洗完， 打包午餐，亲吻孩子的脸 工作从5点到9点
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man."	我可以带回家培根，把它放到火上煎 永远不让你忘了做男人的尊严。
For women, shame is do it all, do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.	对女人，羞耻就是事无巨细， 尽善尽美 而且从来不让别人看到你流汗。
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold, but I guarantee you, it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.	我不知道这广告卖了多少香水， 但我保证， 它省了不少抗抑郁药和抗焦虑药。
Shame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we're supposed to be.	羞耻，对于女人，是一张网 是一张由难以实现的、冲突的、抵触的期望所织成的 关于理想的自己的网。
And it's a straight-jacket.	是一件紧身衣。
For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.	对于男人， 羞耻并不是一系列彼此冲突的期望。
Shame is one, do not be perceived as what?	羞耻是一样东西， 不要被认为什么？
Weak.	弱。
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.	我研究的开始4年中没采访过男人
And it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing, said, "I love what you have to say about shame, I'm curious why you didn't mention men."	直到有一天在图书签售会后，一个男人看着我说： 我欣赏你关于羞耻感的观点， 我很好奇为什么你没提到男人。
And I said, "I don't study men."	我说：我不研究男人
And he said, "That's convenient."	然后他说：这倒真是省事啊
And I said, "Why?"	我说：为什么这么说？
And he said, "Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable.	他说：因为你说要走出去， 讲自己的经历， 不掩饰脆弱。
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?"	但是你看到这些你刚刚 给我妻子和三个孩子签名的书了吗？
I said, "Yeah."	我说：嗯
"They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down.	她们现在宁愿看着我骑着白马英勇的死掉 也不愿看到我掉下来。
When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us.	当我们走出去展现脆弱的时候 我们会被乱拳打死的。
And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads, because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."	而且别跟我说 这是教练啊老爹啊这些男人这么做的， 因为我生命中的女人们才是对我最残忍的。
So I started interviewing men and asking questions.	于是我开始采访男人 向他们提问。
And what I learned is this: You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear, I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.	而我所学到的就是： 如果你能给我找到这样一个女人，她确实能陪在一个 被脆弱和恐惧所淹没的男人旁边， 那么我就能给你找出能完成不可思议工作的女人。
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it, she can't do it all anymore, and his first response is not, "I unloaded the dishwasher," but he really listens -- because that's all we need -- I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.	你如果能给我找到这样一个男人，他可以陪在一个 已经快到底线， 再也无法承受的女人旁边， 而且他的第一反应并不是： 我把碗都洗好啦 （意指只会机械的做家务而不懂沟通） 而是他能真切的聆听 -- 因为那就是我们所需要的 -- 那我就能给你找到真正能干的男人。
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.	羞耻感是我们文化中的一种流行病，
And to get out from underneath it, to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.	为了脱离这个困境， 找到重归彼此的路， 我们必需要理解它是如何影响我们 以及它如何影响我们教育孩子的方式， 工作的方式，看待彼此的方式。
Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.	非常快的分享一些来自波士顿大学的马哈立克的研究成果
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?	他提出了一个问题：怎样做才算是个标准的女人？
The top answers in this country: nice, thin, modest and use all available resources for appearance.	在这个国家排前几位的答案是： 善良，苗条，端庄 并且运用一些资源来美化外表。
When he asked about men, what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms, the answers were: always show emotional control, work is first, pursue status and violence.	当他问男人们， 这个国家的男人们需要怎么做 才算是个标准男人， 答案是： 永远喜怒不形于色，工作第一， 追求地位以及暴力。
If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame.	如果我们想找到重归彼此的路， 我们必须知道并理解共鸣， 因为共鸣是羞耻的解药。
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.	如果你把羞耻放入培养皿， 它需要三样东西来成倍繁殖： 隐蔽、沉默，以及裁决
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive.	如果你放同样量的羞耻到培养皿里并且浇上共鸣， 它就不能存活。
The two most powerful words when we're in struggle: me too.	在争执中最有力的三个字： 我也是。
And so I'll leave you with this thought.	所以我想把这些思考留给大家。
If we're going to find our way back to each other, vulnerability is going to be that path.	如果我们想找到 重归彼此的方法。 脆弱将会是正确的路径。
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena, because I think I did it my whole life, and think to myself, I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.	我知道站在竞技场外面是很诱人的， 因为我想我一辈子都在这么做， 并且对自己说， 我要进去踢某人的屁股 只要我已经刀枪不入并且完美无瑕。
And that is seductive.	这就是种诱惑。
But the truth is that never happens.	不过真相是这永远不会发生。
And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there, that's not what we want to see.	而且即使你已经尽可能的完美了 并且把自己尽可能的装备成刀枪不入 当你进去的时候， 那并不是我们想看到的。
We want you to go in.	我们希望你进去。
We want to be with you and across from you.	我们想和你在一起和你面对面。
And we just want, for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with, to dare greatly.	我们只是想要， 为我们自己和我们在意的人 以及和我们一起战斗的人， 无所畏惧的征战。
So thank you all very much.	非常感谢大家。
I really appreciate it.	真的很感激。
In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti, my former professor of art history, and today a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.	1975年，我在佛罗伦萨巧遇了卡洛·佩德雷蒂教授， 我曾经的艺术史老师，如今他 已是位享誉世界的莱昂纳多达芬奇研究家。
Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci, the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.	他问我是否能找到一些技术手段 去解开一个长达五个世纪的谜团， 关于达芬奇失传的作品—— 那幅本来应该保存于佛罗伦萨的韦奇奥宫 500人大厅的名画安吉亚里之战。
Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so I decided, with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500 searching for the lost Leonardo.	但是在上个世纪70年代没有太多施展才华的机会 给我们这些生物工程学家，尤其是在意大利，所以 我决定，加入一个由美国学者 和佛罗伦萨大学共同发起的研究团队，深入探究那些 由瓦萨里主持装饰在500人大厅墙上的壁画 搜索莱昂纳多达芬奇丢失的作品。
Unfortunately, at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking, because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000 thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.	不幸的是，那时候我们还处在起步阶段 完全没有任何头绪，不知道该从哪里开始寻找， 所以我们并没有取得什么实质进展，因为我们没有深入的搜索， 研究也因此停滞不前，直到2000年 靠着吉尼斯家族的鼎力相助，研究活动才得以再度开展。
Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling, and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494, and to find out the original doors, windows, and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model, and then, with thermography, we went on to discover hidden windows.	所以，这次我们将竭尽全力重现500人大厅 重修之前的本来面目， 不仅如此我们还要重现传说中建于1494年的萨拉格兰德墙， 为了重现当年的那些门窗， 为了达到这一目的，我们首先制作了一些3D模型， 随后依靠热成像技术，我们找到了一些 隐藏起来的的窗户。
These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande.	这些窗户都是最初 存在于萨拉格兰德墙上的。
We also found out about the height of the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore, all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came Vasari, and restructured the whole thing, including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari" on a specific area of one of the two walls.	不仅如此我们还测出了 最初天花板的高度，经过我们的不懈努力， 最终，我们找出了瓦萨里改造之前 500人大厅的原始规划与布局 并且成功的重现了这一切 包括一个非常重要的扶梯 此扶梯是当时为了准确安放安吉亚里之战 而准备的众多工具之一。
Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family, we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap.	而且我们还找到至少两个保护珍惜艺术品的案例， 由美第奇家族的大公爵科西莫一世授权负责 1560年和1574年500人大厅 改造工程的瓦萨里先生所设计。 具体措施是留出少许的间隙在新墙壁 与原有墙壁之间。
One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo, since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.	其中之一是在佛罗伦萨圣塔玛利亚·诺维拉教堂，保护马萨乔的作品， 所以我们推测，也许，瓦萨里在500人大厅工程上 也会用相同的方法保护达芬奇的伟大艺术品， 因为他也是达芬奇的铁杆粉丝。
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.	于是我们专门搭建一些非常复杂的雷达装置 专门对墙壁进行侦测，希望能找到存在于墙于墙之前的间隙。
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall, an air gap, and that's where we believe "The Battle of Anghiari," or at least the part that we know has been painted, which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.	最终我们确实找到了类似的间隙位于东墙的右侧， 一个间隙，而且那里恰恰是 我们一直推测的安吉亚里之战被放置的位置， 或者至少是另一幅壁画 为军旗而战的所在地。
Well, from there, unfortunately, in 2004, the project came to a halt. Many political reasons.	很可惜的是 2004年我们的研究活动被迫中止 因为各种各样的政治因素
So I decided to go back to my alma mater, and, at the University of California, San Diego, and I proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.	所以我那时决定回到我的母校， 加州大学圣地亚哥分校， 随后在我的倡议下 为了更好的把工程科学运用到文化遗产的研究上，
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture and archaeology.	我校在2007年成立了CISA3 研究中心， 具体研究包括文化遗产，艺术，建筑学和 考古学。
So students started to flow in, and we started to build technologies, because that's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork.	 愈来愈多的学生加入了我们， 自此我们开始开发各种必要的技术，因为 我们认为只有开发更多的技术才能 在实践工作中取得进展。
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011, and this time, with a great group of students, and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester, who is now the director at CISA3, and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left.	我们在2011重返500人大厅， 这一次，多了一大批优秀的学生 以及我的同事，CISA3现任主管， 法考库斯特教授， 我们这次回来 已经是胸有成竹，我们知道这次该去哪找， 找出那里究竟还有什么。
Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say, for several reasons that it's not worth explaining, to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had, and with a 4mm camera attached to it, we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color, black color, and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams, XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well, those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo.	但是我们遇到各种刁难，或者说被限制 因为一些根本不值得解释的原因 虽然我们有很多其他选择，却只能使用内镜检查技术 通过一个4毫米镜头来窥视， 我们最终还是成功的证明 并且发现一些彩色的碎片 包括淡红色碎片，黑色碎片 一些米黄色碎片随后也被发现 我们立刻对这些碎片展开了更多复杂的检验 包括射线荧光光谱，X光射线衍射，最终的结果对于我们的推测非常有利 至此，我们认为这个现象指出 我们确实找到了一些颜料，而且我们能肯定 没有其他的艺术家曾经在这张墙上作画 直到大约六十年后瓦萨里来到这里，所以， 这些颜料已经被确定跟壁画有密切的联系 很有可能就是达芬奇那幅。
Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind.	要知道，我们的研究是为了人类有史以来 最崇高最伟大的艺术成就。
As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had, and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named the number one artist influence at the time.	一个重要是事实就是，这幅作品也是达芬奇目前为止 接受的最重要的委托， 正是因为这幅作品，他才被认为是 那个时代最有影响力的艺术家。
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me, but basically to do what?	我非常荣幸在过去的37年里 可以为这些杰作而工作，您可以看到他们就在我身后， 不过您知道我的工作到底是什么吗？
Well, to assess, for example, the state of conservation.	 其实，就是对他们进行检验，比如 这件稀世珍宝。
See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another, different lady, aged lady, I should rather say.	看这里 椅子上的麦当娜 当紫外线照在这位女士脸上的时候 你会突然看到另一位，不同的女士 年长的女士，我应该这么说。
There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches, and some over cleaning.	有很多亮光漆还在她脸上，很多处的润饰， 有些地方过度清洗。
It becomes very visible.	所以很容易看出来。
But also, technology has helped to write new pages of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.	不仅如此，科技也已经为我们的历史写下了新的篇章 或者说至少更新了我们的历史。
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn," another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.	比如这幅女士和独角兽 拉斐尔的作品，你们都看到独角兽了对吧。
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.	这只独角兽引发了各种各样的推测与讨论，但是 如果给独角兽拍张X光的话，它就变成了一只小狗。
And — — no problem, but, unfortunately, continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn, did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn — — unfortunately, is not very reliable.	然后，毫无疑问，但是，不幸的是 对这幅画的进一步科学检验得出的结论是 拉斐尔并没有画独角兽 也没有画小狗，事实上这是一幅 未完成的作品，于是乎所有关于这个奇异的独角兽的一切 天马行空的想象 很不幸 都不是很可靠。
Well, also, authenticity.	同样的，真实性。
Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art.	稍微思考下 如果有朝一日科学可以进入艺术品真伪 的鉴定领域。
There would be a cultural revolution to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution, let me add. Take this example: Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life" at the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through, and luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed that there is a signature of Otto Marseus.	那将是一场文化的革命， 即使退一步讲，我认为，也是艺术品市场的革命， 让我补充下这个问题，做一下这个实验 奥托·玛苏斯的名画静止的生命，它保存在 碧提宫画廊，刚刚经过红外线扫描， 对于艺术史学家来说很幸运，它刚被确认为真迹 因为有奥托玛苏斯的签名在上面。
It even says when it was made and also the location.	检测甚至告诉我们 画是何时何地所做。
So that was a good result.	所以说那是一个好结果。
Sometimes, it's not that good, and so, again, authenticity and science could go together and change the way, not attributions being made, but at least lay the ground for a more objective, or, I should rather say, less subjective attribution, as it is done today.	有时候，也不尽是好消息， 所以，再一次的，科学和真实性是可以携手 改变我们鉴赏艺术的方式，不影响我们欣赏艺术的初衷， 却使我们至少可以更客观的看待艺术 或者说少一些主观臆断 就像今天我们做的这些。
But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer, brown layer, of "The Adoration of the Magi."	但是我想说这次的发现深深的勾起了 我的想象力，我的仰慕之情，是一副非常不可思议的 画作隐藏在这层棕褐色外层下， 在贤士来朝 这幅作品里。
Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it, and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath.	这里您可以看到 一架人工搭建的红外成像扫描仪 刚刚穿过这幅画褐棕色的 层颜料进行了细致的扫描 试图找到在表层颜料之下还有什么秘密
Well, this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries.	非常好，我们恰好发现了这些在 达芬奇创作于意大利的重要作品中 这些美妙的脸部肖相，自它诞生之日至今5个世纪， 从未展现在世人眼前。
Look at these portraits.	看看这些人物肖像
They're magnificent.	他们简直是太了不起了。
You see Leonardo at work.	 你们亲眼见证了达芬奇的技艺
You see the geniality of his creation, right directly on the ground layer of the panel, and see this cool thing, finding, I should rather say, an elephant.	你们看到了他作品中的温情，真真切切的 体现在这张画的底层深处，再来看看 这个很酷发现，我也许应该说 一只大象。
Because of this elephant, over 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.	 因为这只大象， 还有超过70幅肖像一一浮现，数个世纪都没有人看到。
This was an epiphany.	这个发现犹如醍醐灌顶。
We came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.	我们才开始明白 并证明了这些我们所看到的褐色外层 并不是出自达芬奇之手，从而让我们 五个世纪都无人看到这些画作， 所以除了感谢科学还是只能感谢科学。
Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have this pleasure, this privilege to see all this, to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?	好吧，说说平板电脑吧，我们觉得，不应该只有我们研究者 有这个荣幸去享受到发掘和 探究这些秘密的快乐，怎么才能让更多的人得到这个机会呢？
So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet.	所以我们想到开发一种可以广泛应用的应用程序 运行在平板电脑上。
Let me show you just simulating what we could be doing, any of us could be doing, in a museum environment.	让我展示给大家 我们可以用它来做什么，大家都可以在 博物馆里这样做。
So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?	像我这样带着平板电脑来到博物馆，可以吧？
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see, like this.	然后我们只需要用镜头对准 我们感兴趣的作品去看，就像这样。
Okay?	没问题吧?
And I will just click on it, we pause, and now let me turn to you so the moment the image, or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting, then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded.	然后我只要点一下这里，我们暂停， 然后现在让我把它转向你们，所以你们可以看到那一刻 或者我应该说，摄像头，已经锁定了油画 然后你们刚刚看到的那些神秘的画中画 已经被保存在电脑里。
And so, see.	所以看着
We can, as we said, we can zoom in.	我们可以，就像我说过得，我们可以放大。
Then we can scroll.	我们可以拖拽它。
Okay?	没问题吧？
Let's go and find the elephant.	让我们开始寻找大象吧。
So all we need is one finger.	所以我们只需要一只手指。
Just wipe off and we see the elephant.	只需要擦掉他们 然后我们就看到大象了
Okay?	不错吧？
And then if we want, we can continue the scroll to find out, for example, on the staircase, the whole iconography is going to be changed.	不仅如此只要你想， 我们可以继续在它上面寻找，比如，举个例子， 在楼梯那个例子里，整个图解都会被 改变。
There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple, and there are a lot of figures showing up.	那里有很多外行人也可以再现出 来自旧神庙废墟的新神庙， 而且可以看到很多人影出现了。
See?	看吧？
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology, the meaning of the painting, and we believe this is a cool way, easy way, that everybody could have access to, to become more the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums.	这不只是满足好奇心，因为它改变的 不只是你看到的图像，还改变了图像学， 和这幅画的意义 并且我们相信这个方式很时髦，简单， 所以每个人都能掌握它， 当走过博物馆无数的房间时， 你可以成为探险故事的主演， 而不是被动的去欣赏。
Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients, but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately, it's never been tapped as an idea.	另一个概念叫做数字化临床图表，听起来非常容易理解 就如同我们面对的是真正的病人， 很不幸，当我们面对艺术品的时候， 还没有人从这种角度出发。
Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning, the very first step, to do real conservation, and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation, the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting.	但是，我们相信，有信心认为这个理念需要开始落实， 第一步，去做真正的保护工作， 允许我们这样的人，进行真实的探索和研究 所有与这些稀世珍宝有关的一切， 包括技巧、原料，以及我们该何时 以及处于何种目的去修复，或者，去干涉 画作周围的环境。
Well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together.	其实，我们的观点是去重新发掘 文艺复兴的精神，创造一个新的准则 为保护文化遗产而衍生出的工程学，实际上 已经成为把艺术与科学融合在一起的标志。
We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values, these cultural values that we badly need, especially today.	为此我们肯定需要新一代的工程师 我们会到世界各地做这些工作 重新发掘艺术作品，这些文化价值 对于今天的我们是特别急需的。
And if you want to summarize in one just single word, well, this is what we're trying to do.	如果你想把这些做个总结， 那么，这就是我们正在奋斗的方向——
We're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future.	我们正努力将未来应用到历史之中 目的是拥有一个更好的未来。
As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion, there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us.	只要我们的生活充满好奇与激情 每个人都是艺术家，就像达芬奇一样。
Thank you.	谢谢大家。
In 1991 I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life.	1991年可能是我一生中 最重要也是改变我最大的 一年。
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.	在我七年的本科里，我当时大三。
I took a couple victory laps in there.	我复读了好几届。
And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California, and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus, and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains.	一天，我参加了大学合唱队的北加州演出之旅， 坐了一天的巴士后，我们终于停了下来， 当时我们正在山里的一个美丽的湖泊旁 休息。
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise, and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us, and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley, so help me God, every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time.	蟋蟀、小鸟、蛙声一片， 我们坐在那儿，山的北边飘来大朵厚厚的 似史蒂芬斯·皮尔伯格电影里的云团 朝我们席卷过来， 当云团飘到山谷一半时， 不可思议的事情发生了----山谷里所有动物发出的声音 嘎然而止。
This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.	（呼唏）万籁俱寂，好像它们感觉到要发生什么，
And then the clouds came over us, and then, boom!	然后，云团飘到我们头顶，突然， 嘣！
This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.	霹雳雷震，大雨如织。
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, and decided to set it to music, a piece for choir called "Cloudburst," which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.	太震撼了！我回到家后 找到一首墨西哥诗人奥克塔维奥·帕斯写的诗， 并决定把它谱成曲， 一首合唱曲目，叫《暴雨》， 一会儿我们即将为各位演唱这首歌曲。
Now fast forward to just three years ago.	但现在，先让我们回到三年前，
And we released to YouTube this, the Virtual Choir Project, 185 singers from 12 different countries.	我们在You tube上发布了这个， 网络虚拟合唱项目（Virtual Choir Project)， 来自12国家的185为歌手同台献艺，
You can see my little video there conducting these people, alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home.	你可以看到我在小视频里指挥这些歌手， 歌手们有的在自己的宿舍里， 有的在家里的客厅献唱。
Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered Virtual Choir 2, 2,052 singers from 58 different countries, this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."	两年前，同样在这个平台上， 虚拟合唱团二举行首演， 来自58个国家的2052位歌手参与其中， 这次演唱的曲目是我写的《睡眠》。
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3, "Water Night," another piece that I had written, this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.	就在今年春天，我们发布了虚拟合唱团三， 《水夜》，我写的另一首曲子， 这次，来自73个国家的近4000名歌手献唱。
And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this, he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.	我和克里斯谈到虚拟合唱团未来的时候， 谈到我们的发展方向的时候， 他鼓励我把技术的运用推向极致，
Could we do this all in real time?	我们能进行实时表演吗？
Could we have people singing together in real time?	我们的歌手能进行实时演唱吗？
And with the help of Skype, that is what we are going to attempt today.	借助Skype软件， 今天，我们就将尝试这一伟大创举。
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.	下面，我们将为各位献上《暴雨》。
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.	曲子的前半部分由台上的歌手们现场演唱，
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College, some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and — -- and in the second half of the piece, the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers from 30 different countries.	他们是来自加州州立大学长滩分校的歌手， 来自加州州立大学富尔顿分校以及来自里弗赛德社区学院的 合唱团——他们是美国最优秀的业余合唱团， 曲子的后半部分， 虚拟合唱团将加入我们，他们是来自30个国家的 30名歌手。
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go, but there's still less than a second of latency, but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.	现在，我们已经把技术的运用推向了极致， 但是仍然有不到一秒的延迟， 在音乐里，这是不允许的。
We deal in milliseconds.	我们要求同步到毫秒。
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst" so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together.	所以，我把《暴雨》作了调整。 这样，曲子本身预留出延迟的时间 表演者就能在延迟的时间内开口歌唱 而不是全部同步。
So with deep humility, and for your approval, we present "Cloudburst."	下面，满怀谦卑与感激， 让我们带来《暴雨》。
[The rain ...] [Eyes of shadow-water] [eyes of well-water] [eyes of dream-water.]	【雨……】 【影水之眼】 【井水之眼】 【梦水之眼。
[Blue suns, green whirlwinds,] [birdbeaks of light pecking open] [pomegranate stars.]	】 【蓝色的太阳，绿色的旋风，】 【鸟喙轻轻地叩开】 【石榴星辰。
[But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?]	】 【但是，告诉我，烧焦的地球啊，难道没有水吗？
[Only blood, only dust,] [only naked footsteps on the thorns?]	】 【只有鲜血，只有尘土，】 【只有荆棘上赤裸的脚印？
[The rain awakens...] [We must sleep with open eyes,] [we must dream with our hands,] [we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,] [of the sun dreaming its worlds.]	】 【我们必须睁着眼睡去，】 【我们必须用双手追梦，】 【我们必须梦着河流的梦，追寻前行的路，】 【我们必须梦着太阳的梦，梦想着她的世界。
[We must dream aloud,] [we must sing till the song puts forth roots,] [trunk, branches, birds, stars.]	】 【我们必须高声地梦想，】 【我们必须歌唱，直到歌曲生出根、】 【干、枝、鸟、星。
[We must find the lost word,] [and remember what the blood,] [the tides, the earth, and the body say,] [and return to the point of departure...] ["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre] Eric Whitacre: Beth. Annabelle, where are you?	】 【《暴雨》奥克塔维奥·帕斯】【英译：莱赛德·肯普，改编：埃里克·惠特克】 埃里克·惠特克：贝斯，安娜贝勒，你们在哪儿？
Jacob.	雅各布。
Thank you.	谢谢。
Hi.	嗨。
I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine.	我在这里要和大家谈谈 向别人表达赞美，倾佩和谢意的重要性。 并使它们听来真诚，具体。
And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it.	之所以我对此感兴趣 是因为我从我自己的成长中注意到 几年前， 当我想要对某个人说声谢谢时， 当我想要赞美他们时， 当我想接受他们对我的赞扬， 但我却没有说出口。
And I asked myself, why?	我问我自己，这是为什么？
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.	我感到害羞，我感到尴尬。
And then my question became, am I the only one who does this?	接着我产生了一个问题 难道我是唯一一个这么做的人吗？
So, I decided to investigate.	所以我决定做些探究。
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.	我非常幸运的在一家康复中心工作， 所以我可以看到那些因为上瘾而面临生与死的人。
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as, their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.	有时候这一切可以非常简单地归结为， 他们最核心的创伤来自于他们父亲到死都未说过他为他们而自豪。
But then, they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he never told the son.	但他们从所有其它家庭或朋友那里得知 他的父亲告诉其他人为他感到自豪， 但这个父亲从没告诉过他儿子。
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.	因为他不知道他的儿子需要听到这一切。
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?	因此我的问题是，为什么我们不索求我们需要的东西呢？
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, "Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids," but won't ask.	我认识一个结婚25年的男士 渴望听到他妻子说， 感谢你为这个家在外赚钱，这样我才能在家陪伴着孩子， 但他从来不去问。
I know a woman who's good at this.	我认识一个精于此道的女士。
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, "I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."	每周一次，她见到丈夫后会说， 我真的希望你为我对这个家和孩子们付出的努力而感谢我。
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."	他会应和到哦，真是太棒了，真是太棒了。
And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that.	赞扬别人一定要真诚， 但她对赞美承担了责任。
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten, she thanks her children for doing their chores.	一个从我上幼儿园就一直是朋友的叫April的人， 她会感谢她的孩子们做了家务。
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"	她说：为什么我不表示感谢呢，即使他们本来就要做那些事情？
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?	因次我的问题是，为什么我不说呢？
Why were other people blocking it?	为什么其它人不说呢？
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes," but I won't say, "Would you praise me this way?"	为什么我能说：我要一块中等厚度的牛排， 我需要6号尺寸的鞋子， 但我却不能说：你可以赞扬我吗？
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.	因为这会使我把我的重要信息与你分享。
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.	会让我告诉了你我内心的不安。
I'm telling you where I need your help.	会让你认为我需要你的帮助。
And I'm treating you, my inner circle, like you're the enemy.	虽然你是我最贴心的人， 我却把你当作是敌人。
Because what can you do with that data?	你会用我托付给你的重要信息做些什么呢？
You could neglect me.	你可以忽视我。
You could abuse it.	你可以滥用它。
Or you could actually meet my need.	或者你可以满足我的要求。
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this -- same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.	我把我的自行车拿到车行－－我喜欢这么做－－ 同样的自行车，他们会对车轮做整形。
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better."	那里的人说：当你对车轮做整形时， 它会使自行车变成更好。
I get the same bike back, and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.	我把这辆自行车拿回来， 他们把有小小弯曲的铁丝从轮子上拿走 这辆车我用了2年半，现在还像新的一样。
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.	所以我要问在场的所有人，
I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear.	我希望你们把你们的车轮整形一下： 真诚面对对你们想听到的赞美。
What do you need to hear?	你们想听到什么呢？
Go home to your wife -- go ask her, what does she need?	 回家问问你们的妻子，她想听到什么？
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?	回家问问你们的丈夫，他想听到什么？
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.	回家问问这些问题，并帮助身边的人实现它们。
And it's simple.	非常简单。
And why should we care about this?	为什么要关心这个呢？
We talk about world peace.	我们谈论世界和平。
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?	我们怎么用不同的文化，不同的语言来保持世界和平？
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.	我想要从每个小家庭开始。
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.	所以让我们在家里就把这件事情做好。
And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons.	我想要感谢所有在这里的人们 因为你们是好丈夫，好母亲， 好伙伴，好女儿和好儿子。
And maybe somebody's never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good job.	或许有些人从没跟你们说过 但你们已经做得非常非常得出色了。
And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas.	感谢你们来到这里， 向世界显示着你们的智慧，并用它们改变着世界。
Thank you.	谢谢。
It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe, which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe.	今天很荣幸 与大家分享 数字宇宙。 它是为了让人类 能真正看到我们在宇宙 的何处。
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.	我想我们可以开始播放了。
[The Himalayas.] The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite: unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste.	【喜马拉雅山】 Carter Emmart（卡特·艾玛特）：我们看到水平地平线 象征着 无穷无尽的资源 和无限的能力， 由我们充分使用的未利用的资源。
It wasn't until we really left Earth, got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself, that we could understand our planet as a limited condition.	直到我们真的 离开了地球， 来到大气层之上 看到地平线 向后弯曲， 我们才明白我们的地球 处于一种极限状态。
The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past 12 years.	数字宇宙的地图集 已经被制作， 在过去的12年里 并放在美国自然历史博物馆。
We maintain that, put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales.	我们保持了这个地图集， 并建立一个项目 将地图集合在一起， 从各个不同的范围 真正意义上地绘制宇宙。
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe, as we see.	我们在这里看到的是围绕地球的卫星， 以及地球在宇宙中 的固定位置，正如我们所看到的。
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world.	美国国家航空和宇宙航行局，12年前 将此工作 作为重建 Hayden Planetarium的部分， 让我们能与世界分享。
The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome.	以数字宇宙作为空间的 基础，来展示我们的产品 -- 我们主要的空间展示在这个穹顶内。
But what you see here is the result of, actually, internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden.	但你们在这里看到的 成果出自于现在的实习项目， 是我们与Linkoping大学在瑞典 共同主办的。
I've had 12 students work on this for their graduate work, and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden.	我们有12个学生为此项目工作， 作为他们的毕业项目。 而最后的成果是这个叫做Uniview的软件 和在一个叫SCISS的瑞典公司。
This software allows interactive use, so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live.	这个软件 允许交互式的使用。 所以这个真实的飞行轨迹 和我们这里看到的影片 实际上是飞行的实况。
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live, and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology.	我在我的笔记本电脑上捕捉到了这个实况， 在一个叫做Earth Matters的咖啡馆里， 在曼哈顿的下东部，也就是我生活的地方。 是与鲁宾博物馆的喜马拉雅艺术合作 来完成一个展览， 展示比较宇宙学。
And so as we move out, we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here, light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.	正如我们逐渐迁出， 我们从我们的行星逐渐看到 并一直延伸到我们这里所看到的真正的星系， 光时旅行，让你感觉到我们所处有多遥远。
As we move out, the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long, we're essentially backing up into the past.	当我们离开， 从那些遥远星系发出的光 用了如此长的时间， 本质上我们正在回到过去。
We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us -- the afterglow of the Big Bang.	我们回到非常早以前， 我们最终能看见围绕我们存在的密闭空间 -- 也就是宇宙大爆炸后的余晖。
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see.	这是威尔金森微波各向异性探测器 的微波背景， 正如我们看到的。
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.	我们将飞出此处，来看这一密闭空间。
If we were outside this, it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.	如果我们在此之外， 其实是毫无意义的，因为这意味着在时间之前。
But this our containment of the visible universe.	但是，这就是我们可视宇宙的密闭空间。
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.	我们知道宇宙比我们所看见的要大。
Coming back quickly, we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning, but these are positions, the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped, and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.	快速返回， 我们这里看到的就是最初我们跳离的放射领域。 但这些位置是 我们所绘制的 系外行星的最新位置。 这里我们的太阳显然是在太阳系之内的。
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the paths of Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10, the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.	即将看到的是-你们即将迅速跳进此处， 介乎几个数量级之间， 来回到我们能看到太阳系的地方。 这些轨迹是 旅行者一号，旅行者二号，先驱者11号和先驱者10号， 四个最先离开太阳系的宇宙飞船。
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.	我知道Carolyn Porco博士是摄影私人调查员，
for the Cassini mission.	为Cassini（卡西尼）探测录工作。
But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases, ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan, which is larger that the planet Mercury, diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.	但是我们这里看到的是来自于卡西尼探测录 复杂的轨道， 以不同的颜色标记不同的飞行阶段， 巧妙的展开。 因此45次与最大的卫星-Titan相遇， 而它比水星还要大， 将轨道划分为飞行阶段的不同部分。
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this.	这个软件能让我们离得更近 的看到其中的部分。
This software can also be networked between domes.	这个软件能用互联网在宿舍之间连接。
We have a growing user base of this, and we network domes.	而这一软件的用户正在增长。 并且我们还在连接其它的学生宿舍。
And we can network between domes and classrooms.	还可以在宿舍与教室之间联网。
We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia.	事实上，我们分享的是宇宙的旅行， 先与撒哈拉沙漠以南的地区 的加纳天文馆， 与此同时 与哥伦比亚少数族群区 新建立的图书馆 以及位于柬埔寨 一个高中。
And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.	柬埔寨已经 能从高中登录海登天文馆。
This is an image from Saturday, photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.	这是周六拍摄的一张图像， 它由水资源监测太空器拍摄，和用Uniview软件。
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.	所以你们看见的是地球的边缘。
This is Nepal.	这是尼泊尔。
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa, right here in Tibet.	这是，实际上，这里是拉萨的谷地， 就在西藏。
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India.	但是我们可以看到薄雾 来自于恒河谷地的火源等等 向下刮向印度。
This is Nepal and Tibet.	这是尼泊尔和西藏。
And just in closing, I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -- here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out -- so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is.	就到这里。 我想说，在我们所居住的这个美丽的世界 -- 这里我们看见一点雪 而你们中的一些人出来的时候可能就得勇敢点。 我只想说 世界现在需要的 是在某种意义上，能够 在全局下现在审视我们自己 以及广义上了解什么是家。
Because our home is the universe, and we are the universe, essentially.	因为我们的家正是宇宙， 而我们本质上就是宇宙。
We carry that in us.	我们将宇宙带到我们身边。
And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all, I think, in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe.	然后能够看我们所处何处 从广义上，从各个不同的角度 我想，这帮助我们理解 在宇宙中我们身处何处以及我们是谁
Thank you.	谢谢。
So, why does good sex so often fade, even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever?	为何性爱的激情那么容易褪色？ 就算是那些爱得如胶似漆的夫妇也无一例外。
And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex, contrary to popular belief?	为何亲密的爱情也无法维持激情的色彩呢？ 这和我们普遍对性生活与爱情的关系的认知相违背。
Or, the next question would be, can we want what we already have?	或者说，换第二个问题: 我们能留住我们现有的性生活频率吗？
That's the million-dollar question, right?	这可是个很值得研究的问题，对吧?
And why is the forbidden so erotic?	再者，为什么偷腥会令人如此激情彭拜?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent?	又是什么东西令人在偷尝云雨之情时有如此旺盛的性欲呢？
And why does sex make babies, and babies spell erotic disaster in couples?	又是为何性爱孕育了儿女 而儿女却最终反过来却成为夫妻性爱的灾难呢？
It's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it?	这对于性欲可是种致命的打击，不是么？
And when you love, how does it feel?	还有，当你爱时，你有什么感受?
And when you desire, how is it different?	并且当你产生欲望时，这种感受又会有什么不同的变化?
These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love.	这些都是 我今天想要探讨的问题 -----探索现代爱情中人类的原始性冲动 和其伴随而来的困境
So I travel the globe, and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered, there seems to be a crisis of desire.	为了这一研究，我去了很多国家 而我注意到 凡是浪漫的国度 都面临着性欲消退的危机。
A crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality, of our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies.	欲望消退危机----正如我们的需要一样, 性欲作为我们对自身个体的表达： 是对于我们的自由选择、偏好和身份的一种需要 性欲已经成为 现代爱情和崇尚个人主义的社会的核心概念
You know, this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term, not because we want 14 children, for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it, and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.	要知道，这是人类历史上首次 我们长期体验性爱 不是为了生一大堆孩子,比如说14个。 -----或许我们部分人可能要生养育更多，以防很多可能会夭折， 也不是源于女人生儿育女的天职。
This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire.	人类第一次将我需要性的观点超越了仅仅是体内的性欲在作怪 是因为性爱能给人们带来愉悦和稳定的关系。
So what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult?	那么,究竟是什么在维持着人的性欲?而维持性欲为何又这么难呢？
And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship, I think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.	要维持夫妻关系中的性欲的关键 我认为在于协调两种人类的基本需求。
On the one hand, our need for security, for predictability, for safety, for dependability, for reliability, for permanence -- all these anchoring, grounding experiences of our lives that we call home.	一方面，是我们对安全、可预测性、 安全感、可靠性、可依赖感和对永恒的需要。 所有这些生活中能为我们提供所需的厚实而安稳的体验的地方 就是我们所说的家。
But we also have an equally strong need -- men and women -- for adventure, for novelty, for mystery, for risk, for danger, for the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise -- you get the gist -- for journey, for travel.	但同时, 无论男女, 我们,还有另一种强烈的需要 ---那就是对冒险，对新奇事物，神秘、危险、风险 以及对未知有的、预料之外和惊喜的渴望。 我的意思是我们喜欢出游，旅行
So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship, or what we today like to call a passionate marriage, used to be a contradiction in terms.	这就意味着在一段关系中，要协调我们对安稳感的需求 和对猎奇的需要， 我们今天称之为 有激情的婚姻 过去曾是相互矛盾的的两个方面
Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship.	婚姻曾经是一种经济制度 你可以从中获得某种合作关系, 它一般以孩子，社会地位 继承权以及同伴的形式出现。
But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long.	可如今，我们在希望我们的伴侣可以继续提供这些的同时 又要求他们成为我们的知己 做我们可交心的伴侣和激情四射的情人 甚至还想长生不老呢
So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide: Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one.	所以,当我碰到我们的另一半时，我们简直在向对方要求 给我们这些过去原本一整个村庄才能提供的东西： 如财产，名份，至死不渝的忠贞爱情, 同时你还得让我觉得你是卓尔不群，有神秘感和有敬畏心。
Give me comfort, give me edge.	安抚我的同时带给我刺激。
Give me novelty, give me familiarity.	给我新鲜感的同时又要保持亲密。
Give me predictability, give me surprise.	让我过安稳的日子的同时还要能给我惊喜。
And we think it's a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.	多数人认为这是奉献，性玩具和性感睡衣就能解决这些问题。
So now we get to the existential reality of the story, right?	现在我们应该说清楚性爱激情的现实部分了,对吧?
Because I think, in some way -- and I'll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination.	我觉得，从某种角度讲-- 一会我们再会回到这个话题 其实欲望危机就是想象力的危机。
So why does good sex so often fade?	那么为什么美妙的性爱体验容易消散呢？
What is the relationship between love and desire?	爱和欲之间的联系到底是什么呢？
How do they relate, and how do they conflict?	它们是怎样联系起来的，又是怎么相互冲突的呢？
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism.	横亘在这两者之间的是性欲的奥秘。
So if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's "to have."	如果要我用一个动词来描述爱，那就是拥有
And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want."	而对于性欲,我想用索求来描述最恰当不过了。
In love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved.	在爱情中，我们想要拥有，我们想要了解我们的爱人
We want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap.	我们想腻在一起，想跨越阻碍
We want to neutralize the tensions. We want closeness.	我们想调和不安的情绪，我们想亲密无间。
But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone.	而在性欲方面，我们不想回到我们已经经历过的地方。
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest.	过时的结论提不起我们的兴趣。
In desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side that we can go visit, that we can go spend some time with, that we can go see what goes on in their red light district.	在性欲方面，我们想找的是我们的另一半，一个在彼岸,一个我们想去探索的另一半。 一个我们想呆在一起的另一半 和一个我们能探索其瘾秘的内心世界的另一半
In desire, we want a bridge to cross.	在性欲中，我们想找的是一座沟通的桥梁。
Or in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air.	换言之，一个巴掌拍不响啊
Desire needs space.	性欲也需要空间。
And when it's said like that, it's often quite abstract.	这样说或许有点抽象吧。
But then I took a question with me.	带着一个问题
And I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people, when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner?	几年间我带着Mating in Captivity 这本书走访了20多个国家 每到一处，我都会问人们: 你什么时候最喜欢和爱人呆在一起？
Not attracted sexually, per se, but most drawn.	我说的是呆在一起而不是一起性爱
And across culture, across religion, and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back.	来自不同文化、不同地区、不同性别的人 除一个有点例外，其它人给我的回答不外如是
So the first group is: I am most drawn to my partner when she is away, when we are apart, when we reunite.	第一组：最想和爱人在一起的时候 是爱人不在身边的时候、是分开的时候或是小别重逢时。
Basically, when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner, when my imagination comes back in the picture, and when I can root it in absence and in longing, which is a major component of desire.	也就是，当我能用我的想象力 想像我和爱人在一起的时候， 当我的想像力能回到这方面来的时候， 当爱人不在而我又想要的时候 这就是性欲的主要组成部分
But then the second group is even more interesting: I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio, when she is onstage, when he is in his element, when she's doing something she's passionate about, when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him, when I see her hold court.	然而，另一组回答更有趣。 我最想和爱人在一起的时候 是当我看到他在录影棚工作、在舞台上表演的时候、 当他在做正经事的时候、当他在做她感兴趣的事情的时候， 当我看到他在party上谜倒一大堆人的时候 当她开庭的时候。
Basically, when I look at my partner radiant and confident, probably the biggest turn-on across the board.	一般而言，当我看到我的爱人光芒四射而又自信的时候 这就是最大的刺激物了。
Radiant, as in self-sustaining.	光芒四射，在自我维系中也如此。
I look at this person -- by the way, in desire people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is.	在欲望中， 我看这个人 人们很少谈论这些, 当我们粘在一起的时候 也就是相隔5厘米左右的时候---说实在的我不知道是几厘米
But it's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them.	但是,这种分别并不是说相隔太远 以至于以后都不能相见。
It's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance, where this person that is already so familiar, so known, is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.	而是我能在一个比较合适的距离看着我爱的人 那个我熟悉和相知的， 还带有点神秘,有点难以捉摸的人。
And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan, lies that movement toward the other.	我和爱人之间的距离成了一条性欲的纽带 也造成了我们的相互走动
Because sometimes, as Proust says, mystery is not about traveling to new places, but it's about looking with new eyes.	因为有时候，正如Proust说的那样 发现奥秘不一定要到一个新的地方去， 而只要我们有新视角就行。
And so, when I see my partner on his own or her own, doing something in which they are enveloped, I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception, and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me.	所以，当我们看到我们的另一半独自 在忙自己的事的时候。 看着他我会对他有一种新的了解和认识， 而我对我身过的一些奥秘是常怀着关注之情的。
And then, more importantly, in this description about the other or myself -- it's the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire.	更重要的是，对别人的了解 或者对自己的了解, 都一样. 最有趣的是，这不需要性欲。
Nobody needs anybody.	没有谁需要谁。
There is no caretaking in desire.	性欲不存在谁照顾谁的问题。
Caretaking is mightily loving. It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.	照顾是一种了不起的大爱，是一种强大的崔情药
I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them.	我还看到一些人的性欲 是被那些需要他们的人唤起的
Wanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shutdown, and women have known that forever, because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge.	想要是一回事，但需要会令人性趣索然 这点女人最清楚了， 因为任何母性有关的东西 都会降低性欲。
For good reasons, right?	很有道理，是不是?
And then the third group of answers usually would be when I'm surprised, when we laugh together, as somebody said to me in the office today, when he's in his tux, so I said, you know, it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.	第三类回答是: 当我感到惊喜时，当我们一起大笑时会性趣大发， 比如说，今天有人在我的办公室告诉我， 当他穿着无尾半正式晚礼服时最有感觉了 其实性欲与晚礼服或牛仔靴无关
But basically it's when there is novelty.	而是与猎奇有关。
But novelty isn't about new positions. It isn't a repertoire of techniques.	但新奇并不只意味着新的体位，也不是五花八门的性爱技巧
Novelty is, what parts of you do you bring out?	新奇是,你将自已的哪一面展现出来？
What parts of you are just being seen?	你的哪一面你的爱人熟悉？
Because in some way one could say sex isn't something you do, eh?	因为在某种程度上，我们会说 性交并不专指性交活动，对吧?
Sex is a place you go. It's a space you enter inside yourself and with another, or others.	性交过程其实像你在去一个地方 是一个进入自己或对方体内的过程。
So where do you go in sex?	因此，性交时何去何从？
What parts of you do you connect to?	你们身体的哪一部分有接触?
What do you seek to express there?	你们想在那里表达些什么？
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union?	那是一个表现性爱技巧和精神合一的地方吗？
Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive?	那是一个俏皮掏蛋的地方呢还是一个略带点侵略性质的地方呢？
Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything?	还是一个你最后放弃 不想负责任的地方呢?
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes?	它是不是一个你可以表达你孩子气的地方呢？
What comes out there?	性爱到底是什么？
It's a language.	 其实性交是一种语言。
It isn't just a behavior.	不是一种行为。
And it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in, which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence.	而我，正是对这一充满诗意的性交语言感兴趣 这就是为什么我要探讨性商这一概念。
You know, animals have sex.	要知道，动物也性交。
It's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct.	而动物的性交是传宗接代的，是生物的，是一种自然的天性。
We are the only ones who have an erotic life, which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination.	人类是唯一过性生活的物种， 所谓性生活完全是人类想象出来的东西
We are the only ones who can make love for hours, have a blissful time, multiple orgasms, and touch nobody, just because we can imagine it.	人类也是唯一能持续几个小时做爱 有幸福时光，有多次高潮 而没有身体抚摸的动物，因为人类能想象出这些东西。
We can hint at it. We don't even have to do it.	我们可以用意念来交欢，根本就不用直接的身体接触。
We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation, which is a mortar to desire, the ability to imagine it, as if it's happening, to experience it as if it's happening, while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time.	我们能体验强大的性期待 那可是性欲的动机， 能想得到的，它就可以是发生的 能体验到好像正在发生的，而实际上却没发生任何事 所有这些都可以同时发生
So when I began to think about eroticism, I began to think about the poetics of sex, and if I look at it as an intelligence, then it's something that you cultivate.	所以，当我想到性兴奋时， 我就会想到性爱的美妙。 而如果我把它看作一种智商 那么，它就应该是你应该培养的东西。
What are the ingredients?	性商包括什么呢？
Imagination, playfulness, novelty, curiosity, mystery.	想象力、情趣、 新鲜感、好奇心和神秘感。
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination.	但其核心是想象力。
But more importantly, for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark, what sustains desire, I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism, the mystical definition, and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma, which is the other side, and I looked at it looking at the community that I had grown up in, which was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors, and in my community there were two groups: those who didn't die, and those who came back to life.	但更重要的是，如果说我要弄清楚 哪些夫妇有性火花， 什么东西方维系着性爱, 我必须得回顾一下 性爱的最原始的定义, 这一最神秘的定义，我经历过的 以一种分岐，通过创伤来看 这就是另一面，让我来看看 看看我成长的社区 那是一个在比利时的社区，所有人都是大屠杀的幸存者 在这个社区里，有两类人： 一类是没有死过的，另一类是死后重生的
And those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground, could not experience pleasure, could not trust, because when you're vigilant, worried, anxious, and insecure, you can't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative.	那些没死过的人一般都很现实 无法体会快感，不信任人 因为他们过于谨慎、杞人忧天、焦虑 没有安全感，不能自信地 在性爱中解放自我，没有情趣，没安全感也缺乏想象力。
Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death.	那些劫后余生的人 他们把性事当作忘却死亡的解药。
They knew how to keep themselves alive.	他们知道怎样让自己活下去。
And when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with, I sometimes would hear people say, "I want more sex," but generally people want better sex, and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness, of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality, of eros, of energy that sex used to afford them, or that they've hoped it would afford them.	当我听到我的那些无性生活的同事的故事时 有时我听到别人说：我想要更多的性生活。 但很多时候，人们更在意性生活的质量, 最好的是能过传统意义上性生活能提供给他们的活力、 新鲜感、动感、和充满动力的性爱 或者他们希望 能得到这性爱。
"I turn off my desires when ..." which is not the same question as, "What turns me off is ..." and "You turn me off when ..."	 是什么令我毫无性欲。你何时令我性欲全无。
And people began to say, "I turn myself off when I feel dead inside, when I don't like my body, when I feel old, when I haven't had time for myself, when I haven't had a chance to even check in with you, when I don't perform well at work, when I feel low self esteem, when I don't have a sense of self-worth, when I don't feel like I have a right to want, to take, to receive pleasure."	人们会回答说：当我心死时、当我不再喜欢我自己的身体时 我对性也就没有任何兴趣了。 当我感觉自己老了，当我没有自己的时间了， 当我没机会和你去开房时， 当我工作毫无业绩可言时， 当我没有了自尊、当我觉得没有了个人价值时， 当我觉得我已经没有权力去想，去获得 和去接受这种快感受时
"I turn myself on when ..." Because most of the time, people like to ask the question, "You turn me on, what turns me on," and I'm out of the question. You know?	因为很多时候 人们喜欢问这类问题：你令我兴奋 什么使我兴奋? 我不可能兴奋的，对吧？
Now, if you are dead inside, the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's.	但如果你已经心死了，你的另一半可以为你们的情人节做很多事啊！
It won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk.	没有人知道的， 前台没有人呢。
So I turn myself on when, I turn my desires, I wake up when ...	所以，我让自己兴奋 我唤醒自己的性欲，我起来时。。。
Now, in this paradox between love and desire, what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love -- mutuality, reciprocity, protection, worry, responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire.	在爱与欲这对矛盾体里 令人不解的是那些滋润着爱的养分------ 相依相伴、互惠、 爱护有加、担心、和为对方肩负起来的责任 这些东西有时也会抑制性欲。
Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love: jealousy, possessiveness, aggression, power, dominance, naughtiness, mischief.	因为，性欲来自于一系列的 并非全是爱的情感： 比如说妒忌、占有欲、冒犯、权力、支配 俏皮、捣蛋等等。
If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses, we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this.	如果每个人都能躺在床上想着满床的玖瑰 那我们今天就没有必要来听这个演讲了。
But no, in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love, because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word: the ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another.	但其实并不然，在我们心底的某个角落, 有着一些我们不知道的东西 不知道怎么样将这些东西告诉我们的爱人， 这是因为，我们认为爱是自私的， 而性欲在很大程度上出于我们的自私 如果说非得这么说的话 自私就是和别人在一起的时候 只顾自我的感受。
So I want to draw that little image for you, because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs, we are born with that.	所以，让我稍为概括一下 因为这需要调和一下我们与生俱来的东西 这两种需要。
Our need for connection, our need for separateness, or our need for security and adventure, or our need for togetherness and for autonomy, and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable, and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore.	也就是联系的需要，分离的需要 或者安全和冒险的需要 团聚的需要、自我管理的需要 如果你想像一下，有个小孩坐在你大腿上 他舒服地坐在那里，既安全又舒适 而在某种程度上，我们每个人都需要走出去 去发现、去探索.
That's the beginning of desire, that exploratory needs curiosity, discovery.	这就是性欲的来源, 探索需要好奇心和发现。
And then at some point they turn around and they look at you, and if you tell them, "Hey kiddo, the world's a great place.	然后，在某时，他们会转过身来问看着你， 如果你对他们说： 嘿，老兄，这个世界太美妙了，去享受它吧
There's so much fun out there," then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time.	 然后他们会去探索，同时去体验 团聚和分离。
They can go off in their imagination, off in their body, off in their playfulness, all the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back.	他们会开动想象力和调动他们的身体 动起嬉闹的念想，想着 回至家时爱人在等待。
But if on this side there is somebody who says, "I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.	但也有人会说： 我很担心、我很焦虑、我感到无比压抑
My partner hasn't taken care of me in so long.	我和爱人很久都不理不睬了。
What's so good out there?	那里有什么好呢？我们两人在一起不就什么都有了吗？
Don't we have everything you need together, you and I?"	 就你和我？
then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize.	这就会引起一引起小反应 我们很多人都能识别
Some of us will come back, came back a long time ago, and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other.	我们有些人会回到从前，很久很久以前 那些想要回到从前的小孩 就是那些想放弃部分自我的小孩 为了不失去对方
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.	要想不失去爱，我就得失去自由
And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection, and I won't know how to leave you in order to go play, in order to go experience pleasure, in order to discover, to enter inside myself.	而我又得学会用某种方式去爱 这会导致我们过度担心、 过大的责任和过度的保护而不堪重负 而我又不知道怎么放手 让你去享受、去体验快感， 让你去发现，去进入我的内心世界
Translate this into adult language.	这要用成年人的语言来理解。
It starts very young. It continues into our sex lives up to the end.	性欲从我们很小时候就有，它会陪我们进入我们的性生活期 直至我们老死。
Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time.	第二个孩子回来 但伏在他们的肩上。
"Are you going to be there?	你快到了吗？
Are you going to curse me?	你会诅骂我吗？
Are you going to scold me?	你会责备我吗？
Are you going to be angry with me?"	你会生我的气吗？
And they may be gone, but they're never really away, and those are often the people that will tell you, in the beginning it was super hot.	这些或许都不见了，但他们永远都不会远离， 这些就是人们常会和你说的 开始时会很狂热。
Because in the beginning, the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire.	因为刚开始时，亲密感 还没有这么强烈 而恰恰是亲密会削弱性欲。
The more connected I became, the more responsible I felt, the less I was able to let go in your presence.	联系越紧密，觉得责任越大 越不会放手让你走
The third child doesn't really come back.	第三个孩子不会真正的回来
So what happens, if you want to sustain desire, it's that real dialectic piece.	那会怎样？如果你想保持性欲 这是一种真正的辩证法。
On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go.	一方面，为了享受性爱，你需要安全感。
On the other hand if you can't go, you can't have pleasure, you can't culminate, you don't have an orgasm, you don't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own.	另一方面，如果你没有性爱，你不会享受到快感， 不会有性亢奋，不会有高潮 你不会兴奋，因为你花太多的时间在别人的身体上 或心理上，而忽略了自己的身体和想法。
So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs, there are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do.	因此，在妥协的两难中， 这两种基本的需要， 让我解理了性福夫妇的一些做法。
One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.	首先，他们有很多性瘾私。
They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them.	他们明白各人都应该有 各自的空间。
They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing.	他们也清楚前戏并不是 你在性交前5分钟所做的事。
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm.	前戏应该从你上一次高潮结束之后就开始了。
They also understand that an erotic space isn't about, you begin to stroke the other.	他们同时也明白，性爱空间并不是 你开始抚摸对方
It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc., maybe where you leave the agile program, and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible.	性爱是指你开设一个空间，就象经营一间大公司一样 在那里有你灵活的管理计划。
They don't really do well together.	他们不会合作。
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.	有性福的夫妇也明白，激情会慢慢退化。
It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses.	性欲这东西就很像月亮一样有阴晴圆缺。
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it.	但是，他们知道怎么恢复它。
They know how to bring it back, and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth, which is the myth of spontaneity, which is that it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina, and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has.	他们知道怎么样让它再美满起来。 他们能这样做是 因为他们打破了一个神话 那个自然说的神话， 性欲可能会在你的折叠衣物时突然出现 就像从天而降一样，豪无征兆，而事实上，他们明白 无论发生什么 在一个长期的关系中
Committed sex is premeditated sex.	有承诺的性爱是有预谋的性爱
It's willful. It's intentional.	是自愿的、你情我愿的
It's focus and presence.	是投入的和确实存在的
Merry Valentine's.	情人节快乐
Trees epitomize stasis.	树象征静止
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing.	于好几个世代中 树都植根于同一地区的同一块土地 但是如果我们将注意力 由树干转移到树枝 树木的活力就显现出来了 它一直在活动及成长
And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists.	因此我决定开始探索树枝 我认为树木是位艺术家
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.	为什么呢 我在细枝的末端绑上一枝画笔
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art.	然后静待风起 撑起画布 一幅艺术品就此完成
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.	你现在看到在左边那幅图 就是由北美香柏所画的 右边那幅则是花旗松的作品 我发现不同的树种 所留下的图型特征不同 就像毕加索和莫奈的画风不同一样
But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year, I simply measured and summed each of those lines.	我不仅对树木的活力感兴趣 还对将图上的活动轨迹量化也很有兴趣 为测量创作这幅画的藤枫 一年内所移动的距离 我测量这图上每条线的长度 而后加总
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.	然后乘上每个树枝上细枝数目 及每棵树有多少树枝数目 再乘以每年的分钟数
And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year.	这样我就可以算出 每一株树每年的移动距离
You might have a guess.	你可以猜猜看
The answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe.	答案是186,540英里 也就是绕着地球转七圈的长度。
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic.	所以只要将观注的重点由一株树干 转移至许多动态的细枝 我们就可以看出树木不只是静止的 它的动作可还大着呢
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons.	接着我想到由 树木移动所学到的启示 是不是可以应用在其它呼喊着要改变 要自由的 静态或被限制行动的事物上呢 监狱就是一例
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars.	监狱当然是为要将作奸犯科者 困于牢栏之后
And our prison system itself is stuck.	但是我们的监狱体系却自困一角
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women.	美国有二百三十万位 被监禁的男女囚犯
That number is rising.	而且数目还在持续上升
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison.	在一百个出狱的囚犯里 有六十个会再回笼
Funds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.	但是用在教育训练 辅导罪犯改过迁善的经费却一直在减少 所以整个监禁体系是在令人绝望的循环中不断重复
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the answer is yes.	我决定去探究是否可以将 把树当作艺术家的经验 运用在像监狱这样静态 停滞不前的机构上 我发现答案是可行的
In the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections.	在2007年 我开始和 华盛顿州的囚犯矫正部门合作
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons.	选定四个监狱 引进科学实验及科学家 在这四个州立监狱里 进行永续发展 我们给这四个监狱的囚犯
We give science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting.	上科学课程 这些人选择来上我们提供的科学课程 而不是去看电视或举重
That, I think, is movement.	我认为这才是行动
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.	我们和自然保育局合作 请史塔佛溪矫正中心的囚犯 种植濒临绝种的草原植物 用来重建华盛顿州的荒废草原
That, I think, is movement.	这就是我认为的改变
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands.	我们也和华盛顿州的鱼类及野生动物部门 合作养殖滨临绝种的奥勒岗州斑蛙 然后放回湿地保护区
That, I think, is movement.	这就是我认为的改变
And just recently, we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities.	最近我们开始和 被隔离在戒备最森严的 牢房里的重刑犯合作
They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners.	他们都曾经与警卫 或是其他囚犯 有过暴力冲突
They're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day.	他们每天都被关在像这样的 囚室里 23个小时
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals, they're placed in immobile booths like this.	当他们与审查委员或心理专家会面时 他们是被安置在这样一个固定的隔离房间里
For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.	他们每天仅有一小时的时间 可以在这个单调乏味的运动场放风
Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images of nature.	虽然我们不被允许将树草原植物 或是蛙类带入这样的环境 但是我们选择将自然的影像 带入运动场 挂在墙壁上，这样至少他们在视觉上 在视觉上还可以与自然接触
This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene, more calm, less apt to violence.	这位是已经被单独监禁了18个月的Lopez先生 他对这样的图片提供意见表示 他相信这会使他以及其他囚犯 有较安详镇定的感觉 不易诉之暴力
And so what we see, I think, is that small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope.	由前述 我们看到 一个微小但是集体性的行动改变 或许可以推动 像监狱体系这样的个体 往看得见希望的方向前进
We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks.	我们知道光只看树干的话 树是静止的
But if trees can create art, if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year, if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs, then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves, like grief, like addictions, like racism, that can also change.	如果让树自由创作 如果树一年能够绕地球七次 如果囚犯都可以种植植物 养殖蛙类 那么也许深藏在我们心中 那些顽固的想法 如哀伤 沉溺 种族偏见等等 皆可改变
Thank you very much.	谢谢大家
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.	(音乐） 罗比·米宗:谢谢
Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.	唐美·米宗:非常感谢
We're so excited to be here.	能来到这里我们非常激动。
It's such an honor for us.	这是我们的荣幸。
Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey -- you know, the bluegrass capital of the world.	就像他说的，我们是来自新泽西的三兄弟 你知道的，新泽西是世界蓝草音乐之都
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago, and we fell in love with it.	几年前蓝草音乐走进我们的生活 然后我们爱上了它。
We hope you guys will too.	我们希望你们也能喜欢蓝草音乐
This next song is an original we wrote called "Timelapse," and it will probably live up to its name.	接下来是我们的一首原创歌曲时间推移 估计这个名字还是挺贴切的
TM: Thank you very much.	TM：非常感谢
RM: I'm just going to take a second to introduce the band.	RM：我将简单低介绍下我们的乐队
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.	我15岁的哥哥汤米是吉他手
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.	10岁的乔尼是五弦琴手
He's also our brother.	他是我们的小弟弟
And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14, and I play the fiddle.	我是罗比，今年14岁，小提琴手
As you can see, we decided to make it hard on ourselves, and we chose to play three songs in three different keys.	正如各位所见，我们想让表演变得有挑战性 所以我们会用3种不同的调子 来演奏三首曲子
Yeah. I'm also going to explain, a lot of people want to know where we got the name Sleepy Man Banjo Boys from.	我同时要解释一下，有很多朋友想要知道 我们的乐队名瞌睡人／五弦琴男孩的由来
So it started when Jonny was little, and he first started the banjo, he would play on his back with his eyes closed, and we'd say it looked like he was sleeping.	在乔尼还小的时候 当他最初开始弹五弦琴的时候，他总是闭着眼 将琴放在背后弹奏 然后我们就说他好像睡着了一样
So you can probably piece the rest together.	接下来的故事各位就自行想象吧
TM: We can't really figure out the reason for this.	TM：其实我们也不知道乔尼为什么那样弹琴
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds.	搞得就像那琴有一百万磅重一样
TM: Thank you very much.	TM：非常感谢
RM: Thank you.	RM：谢谢
As an architect, I often ask myself, what is the origin of the forms that we design?	作为一个建筑师，我经常扣心自问， 我们设计出来的造型的来源是什么？
What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore?	如果不去参考别人的作品 那么我们会设计出怎样的造型呢？
If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions, what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience?	如果我们没有偏好，没有先入之见， 我们又会设计出怎样的造型呢？ 如果我们将自己从 积累的经验中解锢出来呢？
If we could free ourselves from our education?	如果我们能挣脱教育的束缚呢？
What would these unseen forms look like?	这些前所未有的造型会是什么样子的？
Would they surprise us?	会让我们眼前一亮吗？
Would they intrigue us?	会激起我们的兴趣吗？
Would they delight us?	会让我们感到愉悦吗？
If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?	如果是这样的话，我们要怎样去创造真正新颖的东西呢？
I propose we look to nature.	我建议在大自然中找答案
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms.	大自然一向被称为是伟大的造型建筑师
And I'm not saying that we should copy nature, I'm not saying we should mimic biology, instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.	我意思不是去仿造大自然 也不是去模仿生物 而是借鉴大自然的方法
We can abstract them and to create something that is new.	我们能取其精华然后创造出新的东西
Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis, is the splitting of one cell into two cells.	大自然的主要造物方法，所谓的形态建成 就是一个细胞分裂成两个
And these cells can either be identical, or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division.	这些细胞或者形态相同 或者通过不对称细胞分裂 而彼此形态各异
If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible, then we could start with a single sheet of paper, one surface, and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces.	如果我们提取这个过程，并将它尽可能地简化 那么我们可以从一张纸开始入手 在一个面上我们对折 使它形成两个面
We're free to choose where we make the fold.	我们可以随意选择在哪对折
And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.	这样做后，我们就能制作不同的面
Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms.	通过这一简单的过程， 我们就能创造出无数种变化的造型
Now, we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures, but rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer, and code it as an algorithm.	现在，我们用这种形式，用相同的过程 来生成一个三维的结构 但不再是手工折叠 我们就在电脑里操作 然后用运算法则写下代码
And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.	这样做的话，我们就能瞬间对折任何东西了
If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again, then after 16 iterations, 16 steps, we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks, for instance, like this.	如果我们将它的各平面对折 并且不断地对折 反复进行16次，16个步骤后， 我们得到了400，000个面，和一个这样的形状 比如说，像这样。
And if we change where we make the folds, if we change the folding ratio, then this cube turns into this one.	如果我们改变一下对折的地方 如果我们改变下对折的比率 那么这个立方体就会变成这样
We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape, or this shape.	我们还能通过调节对折比率做出这种造型， 或这种
So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold, but essentially you're looking at a folded cube.	所以我们能通过指定对折的位置 从而对造型进行控制 但事实上你们看到的只是一个经过折叠的立方体
And we can play with this.	我们也能这样做
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions.	我们可以对不同的部位采用不同的对折比率 从而调节出不同部位的特色
We can begin to sculpt the form.	我们就能开始进行造型了
And because we're doing the folding on the computer, we are completely free of any physical constraints.	由于这些对折是在电脑上进行的 所以我们完全不收任何物理禁锢
So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves, they can become impossibly small.	这也意味着这些面能相互交叉 也能变得极其的微小
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.	我们能摆脱常规进行折叠
Surfaces can become porous.	表面可以变得多孔
They can stretch. They can tear.	可以延伸，也可以撕扯
And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.	所有的这一切都证明了我们造型的范围
But in each case, I didn't design the form.	但在每个实例中，我并没对造型进行设计。
I designed the process that generated the form.	我只是设计了创造造型的过程
In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio, which is what you're seeing here, then the form changes correspondingly.	总之，哪怕我们对对折比例做出小小的调整 正如你目前所见到的 这个造型也会相应做出改变
But that's only half of the story -- 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this, but this, the geometric equivalent of noise.	但故事到这里只不过才进行了一半 99.9%的对折比例产生的不是这种形态， 而是这种形态，在几何学上等同于噪音
The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error.	那些我刚展示的造型 其实是经过了长时间的试验和挫折
A far more effective way to create forms, I have found, is to use information that is already contained in forms.	进行造型时，我发现了一种效率极高的方式 就是利用已经包含在造型里的信息
A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.	在一个简单的造型里，比方这个 它就包含了很多我们肉眼看不到的信息
So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.	所以，我们可以标绘出边缘的长度
White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.	白色表面的边缘较长，黑色的则较短
We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature, how radial they are -- all information that may not be instantly visible to you, but that we can bring out, that we can articulate, and that we can use to control the folding.	我们能标绘出这些面的平面度和曲率 它们有多放射状--所有的这些信息 不一定立马就能被你看到 但我们能发现它，我们能将之描述出来 我们能运用这些信息来控制如何折叠
So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it, but instead I'm establishing a rule, I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded.	所以我不再指定一个 单一的折叠率进行对折 相反，我确立了一个规则 我将一个面的属性和它怎样被折叠 给联系起来
And because I've designed the process and not the form, I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms.	也正因为我设计的是方法而非造型 所以我能够一次又一次地使用这种方法 以此得到一个族系的造型
These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.	这些造型看起来很精细，但制作的方法却很简单
There is a simple input, it's always a cube that I start with, and it's a very simple operation -- it's making a fold, and doing this over and over again.	一个简单的输入 我一直都从立方体着手 而且操作也简单--就对折 不断对折
So let's bring this process to architecture.	所以我们不妨将这个过程引入建筑学
How?	怎么做？
And at what scale?	以什么准则？
I chose to design a column.	我决定设计一根柱子
Columns are architectural archetypes.	柱子是建筑的基模
They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty, about technology.	纵观历史，柱子被用来表达 美感，科技
A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column.	我遇到的挑战是我们要怎样 在柱子表达这些新的算法
I started using four cylinders.	我一开始用了四根圆柱体
Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders eventually evolved into this.	通过大量的试验，这些圆柱体 最终进化成这个样子
And these columns, they have information at very many scales.	而且这些柱子蕴含信息的范围很广
We can begin to zoom into them.	我们放大来看
The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.	你越靠近，就会越发现新特点
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.	一些构造几乎就要超出人类的视觉范围
And unlike traditional architecture, it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail.	这不像传统的建筑学 它只需一个简单的方法就能同时获得 整体的造型和显微的表面细节
These forms are undrawable.	这些造型是画不出来的
An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months, or it would take even a year to draw all the sections, all of the elevations, you can only create something like this through an algorithm.	建筑师如果想用笔和纸把他们画出来 可能要画上好几个月 想把各个部分，各个正面图都画出来 甚至得画上一年，你只能通过 运算法则得到这些东西
The more interesting question, perhaps, is, are these forms imaginable?	更有趣的问题，也许是 这些造型是可以想象出来的吗？
Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing.	大多数情况，建筑师都能在脑海里浮现自己所设计的 最终效果图
In this case, the process is deterministic.	而在这种情况下，起决定作用的是那个过程
There's no randomness involved at all, but it's not entirely predictable.	毫无随意性的存在 也非完全可预见
There's too many surfaces, there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.	有太多太多的平面 有太多的细节，谁也看不到最终效果
So this leads to a new role for the architect.	这也就赋予了建筑师新的角色
One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there.	他们需要一种新方法去探索各种可能性 而它们就在那里
For one thing, one can design many variants of a form, in parallel, and one can cultivate them.	一方面，建筑师可以设计出一个造型的不同变体 同时，他又可以让它们发展出其他的形态
And to go back to the analogy with nature, one can begin to think in terms of populations, one can talk about permutations, about generations, about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.	当回到利用大自然进行类比时 建筑师可以参照种群进行思考 他们可以从种群的变换，世代 相交和繁衍中寻找创意
And the architect is really, he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.	而且建筑师真的变身为 整个创作过程的管弦乐演奏家
But enough of the theory.	理论说的足够多了
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue 3D glasses, got up very close to the screen, but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things.	我曾一度想跳进这个画面中 打个比方，我买了些红蓝3D眼镜 凑到屏幕前去看 依然得不到那种 漫步其中亲密接触的感觉
So there was only one possibility -- to bring the column out of the computer.	所以就只有一种做法 把它从电脑里带到现实中来
There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.	其实现在有很多3D印刷的理论
For me, or for my purpose at this moment, there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.	但对我来说，或就我目前的想法而言， 依旧是有太多在比例上不尽人意的权衡 一方面，是比例，另一方面，则是分辨率和速率
So instead, we decided to take the column, and we decided to build it as a layered model, made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.	所以，我们决定把柱子 以层级模式给做出来 以多切割，薄层叠的方式展现出来
What you're looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.	你们目前看到的是刚刚那个柱子 的x射线图，从上往下看的
Unbeknownst to me at the time, because we had only seen the outside, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves, to grow on the inside of the column, which was quite a surprising discovery.	我当时感到很新颖 因为以前都是从外面去看 那些面还在不停地对折 而且是在柱子的内部对折 这个发现是个惊喜
From this shape, we calculated a cutting line, and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce -- and you're seeing a segment of it here -- very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.	从这个模型中我们算出了一条切割线 然后我们用激光切割机进行切割 从而制造--你现在看到的是一个部分 有很多相互堆积而成的很薄的切面
And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering, and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer.	这是一张照片，不是绘制出来的 在付出很多心血后， 我们得到了这个振奋人心的柱子 就如同我们在电脑中设计的一样
Almost all of the details, almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved.	几乎所以的细节 几乎所有的复杂平面都得以保留
But it was very labor intensive.	但这相当地耗费劳动力
There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical.	目前，虚拟空间和物理存在之间 仍存在巨大的断层
It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces.	我们花了好几个月去塑造这根柱子 而运算这个1600万个表面 电脑只需简单的30秒就搞定
The physical model, on the other hand, is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick, it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium.	另一方面，这个实体模型 有2700层1毫米厚的叠层 重约700公斤，是用可以覆盖这整个礼堂 的薄板做成的
And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again.	激光所切割出来的路径 够从这里到机场一个来回
But it is increasingly possible.	但这一切变得越来越有希望
Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive, and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon.	机器不断地在加速，价格也不断地在下降 一些有希望有前途的高科技发展 也即将面世
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale.	这些是光州艺术展上的图片
And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns, we used the bigger, faster machine, and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural, they can bear loads for once.	在那里，我用了丙烯腈-丁二烯-苯乙烯塑料来做原料 我们采用了更大更快的机器 柱子中心都内置钢铁核心，所以不单有结构性 还能负重
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.	每根柱子都是两根柱子的混合体
You can see a different column in the mirror, if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion.	你能在镜子中看到不同的柱子 这些柱子后面的镜子 能产生一种视觉错觉的效果
So where does this leave us?	这些都说明什么呢？
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object, but a process to generate objects.	我觉得这个项目让我们得以一瞥那些等待我们去发掘的前所未见的东西 作为建筑师的我们不妨思考一下，我们不是要设计物品 而是去设计一种方法来创造物品
I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature; there's countless other ones.	我已经展示了受大自然启发的一个方法 但方法是无穷尽的
In short, we have no constraints.	简而言之，我们不受约束
Instead, we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up.	相反，此刻我们手中掌握着的是各种方法 能使我们创造出以前不敢想象的 不受任何比例的约束的构造
And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.	我希望，在某个时候我能将之付诸实践。
Thank you.	谢谢
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union, a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside.	50年以前在前苏联 一队工程师秘密移动一个庞大的物体 通过荒原。

Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases, and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000.	一年之内，国会大幅度提高了军事预算 我们将核武器数量从1200枚 大幅度地提高到了2万枚。
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.	人造卫星的影响不仅仅在武器数量增长上。
For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.	例如，在座的各位也许记得 1958年6月的这一天 进行了国家民防演习 78个城市的数以千万计居民躲进了地下。

OK. We've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind.	在这次的会议上， 我们已经听到了很多人 讲解人类意志的力量。
And what I'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation, how the will to survive can bring that out in people.	而我今天想做的 就是带给你们一个鲜明的例子， 它展示人们是如何在亟需生存的环境下 释放这种力量的， 以及这种力量是如何被生存的欲望所激发。
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest; it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.	这是发生在珠穆朗玛峰上的一个事件。 它是珠穆朗玛历史上最惨重的灾难。
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.	灾难发生时，我是珠峰上唯一的医生。
So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive.	所以我将带领你们重温那次灾难， 身临其境地去感受一下。
It's 29,035 feet high.	海拔29035英尺。
I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic, making tectonic plate measurements; twice, I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices.	我总共去过那里六次。四次是跟着国家地理 丈量构造板块。
Hyakutake.	在我第四次珠穆朗玛之行的时候， 一个彗星，百武彗星划过峰顶。
And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen, and we should have listened to them.	随行的夏尔巴人告诉我们 这是个凶兆， 事后想想，我们真应该听从他们的意见。
Everest is an extreme environment.	珠穆朗玛是个极端的环境。
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.	峰顶的氧气只是海平面的三分之一。
Near the summit, temperatures can be 40 degrees below zero.	靠近峰顶的地方， 气温可以到达零下40度。
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.	风速有时高达每小时20到40英里。
It's actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars.	这其实是风冷因素， 它要比火星上的夏天还要寒冷。
I remember one time being up near the summit, I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle, inside my down jacket, only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.	我记得有一次，在离峰顶不远的地方， 我伸手到我的鸭绒衣里 想拿出我的水壶喝口水， 当时我的水壶是在我的鸭绒衣里， 但我伸手进去的时候却发现水壶里的水已经冰冻如石了。
That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit.	你们由此可以想象峰顶的环境 是何等的恶劣。
OK, this is the route up Everest.	这就是登顶的线路图。
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.	从17500英尺的大本营开始。
Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.	2000英尺之上是一号营地，
Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up, what's called the Western Cwm.	再往上2000英尺是二号营地 昵称西库姆冰斗。
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse, which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.	三号营是在洛子峰的山脚。 洛子峰是世界上第四高的山峰，但和珠穆朗玛峰相比，还是小巫见大巫了。
And then Camp Four is the highest camp; that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.	四号营是最高的营地。 距离峰顶只有3000英尺。
This is a view of base camp.	这就是大本营，
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.	搭建在17500英尺高的冰川上。
It's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload.	这大本营就是你随行的牦牛所能攀爬的最高点， 在这之后你就不得不卸下行囊。
And this is what they unloaded for me: I had four yak loads of medical supplies, which are dumped in a tent, and here I am trying to arrange things.	而这就是我当时所卸下来的东西。 我一共带了四个牦牛才能承载的医疗用品， 全部被转放在一个帐篷里。 这是我在整理杂物。
This was our expedition.	这是我们的探险队。
It was a National Geographic expedition, but it was organized by The Explorers Club.	它是一个国家地理的探险队， 不过是由探险者俱乐部组织的。
There were three other expeditions on the mountain, an American team, a New Zealand team and an IMAX team.	当时还有其他的三个探险队在山上， 一个美国队，一个新西兰队， 还有一个IMAX电影摄像队。
And, after actually two months of preparation, we built our camps all the way up the mountain.	经过两个月的准备， 我们一路搭建帐篷直奔山顶。
This is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp.	这是仰望冰布的景象。 它是从大本营算起的 首个2000英尺攀爬。
And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day.	这是一幅冰布内部的照片。 它其实是一个瀑布，但已经被冻结，很缓慢地流动着， 而且每天都会有变化。
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze; you can't even see over the top.	当你深处其中的时候，感觉就好像是一只在迷宫里的老鼠一样， 甚至无法看到顶端。
This is near the top of the icefall.	这是距离冰布顶部很近的地方。
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.	以避免冰块在你脚下分裂。
That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.	这是些在日出时，登上冰布顶的攀爬者们。
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.	这是我跨越一个裂缝。
This is me crossing a crevasse.	我们攀爬一个有安全绳索的铝制梯子。
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.	这是另一个裂缝。
That's another crevasse.	有些裂缝有十层楼那么深，甚至更深。
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more, and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over, we would never do it.	 跟我同行的攀爬者说 我们之所以选择在夜晚攀爬 是因为如果我们可以清楚看见 我们所攀爬的裂缝的底部的话， 我们是打死也不会爬过去的。
Okay. This is Camp One.	这就是一号营。
It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall.	是在爬过冰布顶部之后 遇到的第一块平地。
And from there we climb up to Camp Two, which is sort of the foreground.	从那里，我们继续爬往二号营， 看起来好像是前景。
These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face, that mountain toward Camp Three.	这些登山者正沿着洛子峰 爬往第三营。
They're on fixed ropes here.	他们捆绑着固定的绳索。
A fall here, if you weren't roped in, would be 5,000 feet down.	如果你在这里跌倒，身上又没有保护绳索的话， 迎接你的将是5000英尺的坠落。
This is a view taken from camp three.	这是三号营的照片。
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile, it's about a 45 degree angle.	你可以看到洛子峰的侧面。 45度的仰角，要花两天的时间才能爬到顶。
It takes two days to climb it, so you put the camp halfway through.	 所以你得在半途中驻扎营地。
If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.	如果你仔细看的话，会发现珠穆朗玛的峰顶是黑色的。
There's no ice over it.	上面并没有冰的覆盖。
And that's because Everest is so high, it's in the jet stream, and winds are constantly scouring the face, so no snow gets to accumulate.	这是因为珠穆朗玛是如此之高， 它处于急流层， 狂风不停地席卷着表面， 因此没有积雪的残留。
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit.	山脊后面那看起来像云彩的东西 实际上是被风吹散的白雪。
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four, moving in, up through the clouds.	这是有三号营攀往四号营， 穿过云层。
And this is at Camp Four.	这是四号营。
Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.	一旦你抵达四号营，你只有大概24个小时的时间 来决定你是否要登顶。
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited, and you either have to go up or go down, make that decision very quickly.	因为每个人都需要氧气罩。 所以你必须快速做出决定， 要么登顶，要么下山。
This is a picture of Rob Hall.	这是Rob Hall的照片。
He was the leader of the New Zealand team.	他是新西兰队的领头人。
This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I'll tell you about.	这是他后来用来给他妻子打电话的收音机， 我等一下会跟你们详细介绍。
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.	这是些等着登顶的登山者们。
They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.	他们正在四号营。你们可以看到，冷风正吹过峰顶。
This is not good weather to climb in, so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.	这种天气并不利于登山， 所以这些登山者们只是等候者，期盼寒风可以减缓。
And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.	事实上，大风在那晚的确是减弱了。
It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.	变得非常平静。根本是一点风都没有。
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.	看上去是登顶的绝佳良机。
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face.	这里看到就是一些开始向峰顶前进的登山者们， 他们所攀爬的就是所谓的三角峰面。
It's the first part of climb.	这只是登顶的第一步。
It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next, and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.	这是在夜间进行的，因为随后的登程要比这个陡很多， 所以在夜间出发的话，就可以稍后获取宝贵的日光。
So that's what happened.	这就是当时的情形。
The climbers got on the southeast ridge.	登山者们登上东南山脊，
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.	这是瞭望东南山脊的景象。
The summit would be in the foreground.	峰顶就在前景中。
From here, it's about 1,500 feet up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.	从这里算起，距离峰顶大概是1500英尺 30度仰角的攀爬。
But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.	但那年所发生的事情是 风速突然意想不到地加大。
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.	暴风在无人预知的情况下突袭。
You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit.	你在这里看到一些狂风暴雪 席卷峰顶。
And there were climbers on that summit ridge.	而登山者们就在那个峰顶脊梁上。
This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before, and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather.	这是一张我一年前 在那个区域拍摄的照片。 你可以看到我带着氧气罩 和呼吸器。
I have an oxygen hose connected here.	我有一个氧气栓连在这里。
You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack -- little titanium tanks, very lightweight -- and we're not carrying much else.	你可以看到在这个登山者的背包中有两个氧气罐， 小的钛金罐，非常轻便。
You're very exposed on the summit ridge.	这就是你所需的一起。
This is on the way toward the summit, on that 1,500-foot bridge.	这是前往峰顶的路上 经过那个1500英尺的链接路。
All the climbers here are climbing unroped, and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody, you'd wind up just pulling them off with you.	所有的登山者都没有捆绑绳索， 原因是因为 两边都极其陡峭， 如果你和他人用绳索连在一起的话， 一旦失足，会连同其他人一起坠下山。
So each person climbs individually.	所以每个人都是单独攀登。
And it's not a straight path at all, it's very difficult climbing, and there's always the risk of falling on either side.	而且攀登的线路并不是一条直线。 这是非常艰难的攀爬， 总是有 坠入两边的风险。
If you fall to your left, you're going to fall 8,000 feet into Nepal; if you fall to your right, you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.	如果你坠向左边，你将下落 8000英尺到达尼泊尔。 如果你坠向右边，你将下落 12000英尺到达西藏。
So it's probably better to fall into Tibet because you'll live longer.	所以还是跌入西藏比较好 至少你能多活一段时间。
But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.	但不管怎样，你都将坠向死亡。
OK. Those climbers were up near the summit, along that summit ridge that you see up there, and I was down here in Camp Three.	这些登山者们即将到达顶峰， 沿着你们看到的那条峰顶脊梁而行进着， 而我当时则是身处下方的三号营。
My expedition was down in Camp Three, while these guys were up there in the storm.	我的探险队当时在三号营， 而这些登山者则是陷在暴风中。
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay, fully dressed, fully equipped, laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.	那场暴风是如此猛烈，我们不得不全身躺下， 全副武装地 躺在帐篷里 以防止帐篷被吹走。
It was the worst winds I've ever seen.	那是我所见过的最恶劣的暴风。
And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher, and completely exposed to the elements.	而那些峰脊上的登山者们 则是身处高处，比我们所在地还要高2000英尺的地方， 并完全地暴露在暴风雪之中。
We were in radio contact with some of them.	我们通过无线电和他们中的一些人保持着联系。
This is a view taken along the summit ridge.	这是沿着峰脊所拍摄的一张照片。
Rob Hall, we heard by radio, was up here, at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen.	我们从无线电中收听到说 Rob Hall此时正在峰脊上，身处暴风中， Doug Hansen也和他在一起。
And we heard that Rob was OK, but Doug was too weak to come down.	我们听说Rob还可以， 但是Doug身体过虚，无法下山来。
He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.	他已经精疲力竭了。Rob就呆在他的身边。
We also got some bad news in the storm that Beck Weathers, another climber, had collapsed in the snow and was dead.	我们也听到了一些其他关于暴风的坏消息。 另一位登山者Beck Weathers 当时已经倒在雪中，不幸逝世了。
There were still 18 other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition.	还有另外18位登山者 所处情况我们当时不得而知。
They were lost.	他们迷失了。山上一片迷茫。
There was total confusion on the mountain; all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.	 各项信息都令人费解，而且很多又是相互矛盾。
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm.	我们真的对暴风中的一切一无所知。
We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three.	我们只是困守在 三号营的帐篷里。
Our two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans, decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going.	我们中最强壮的两个登山者Todd Burleson和Pete Athans 决定登顶去尝试援救可能援救的人， 虽然说当时的暴风依旧是格外猛烈。
They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall, who was a superb climber stuck, sort of, with a weak climber up near the summit.	他们试着给Rob Hall发送无线电信息。 Rob Hall是个杰出的登山者， 不过当时却是和一个相对较弱的登山者 困在了峰顶附近。
I expected them to say to Rob, "Hold on.	我当时以为他们会对Rob说 坚持。
We're coming."	我们马上就来。
But in fact, what they said was, "Leave Doug and come down yourself.	但事实上，他们说的是 丢下Doug，你自己下山来。
There's no chance of saving him, and just try to save yourself at this point."	现在已经没有拯救他的机会了， 最重要的是拯救你自己。
And Rob got that message, but his answer was, "We're both listening."	Rob收到了那条信息， 但他的回复是： 我们两个人都在收听这条信息。
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here, and it was a scene of complete chaos up there.	Todd和Pete最终抵达了峰脊， 迎接他们的是一片混乱。
But they did what they could to stabilize the people.	但是他们还是竭尽所能稳定周边的人员。
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three, and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power.	我从三号营通过无线电向他们传送建议， 我们让那些有能力自己下山的人员 自行下山。
The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.	那些不能自己下山的人，我们决定将他们暂时搁放在四号营。
So the climbers were coming down along this route.	所以登山者们是沿着这条线路下来的。
This is taken from Camp Three, where I was.	这是在三号营，我当时的所在地，拍摄的照片。
And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them, which is really not much, because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle.	他们都来到我身边， 以便于我检查他们，看看有什么是我可以做的。 但我所能做的其实不多，因为三号营 是在45度的冰面上 凿出来一个小洞。
It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.	而且又是在24000英尺的高地上。
The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids.	在当时那个海拔上，我唯一的医疗器材 就是两个塑料袋中 事先装好了止痛药和类固醇的 针筒。
So, as the climbers came by me, I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down.	所以这些登山者来到我身边， 由我来检测他们是否适合 继续向山下行进。
The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated, I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain.	对于那些已经不太清醒的，手脚不太协调了的， 我就会注射一针类固醇， 来帮助他们暂时恢复 一些清醒和协调性， 这样他们可以继续向山下行进。
It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes I even gave the injections right through their clothes.	在那么高的地方医治有时候是相当困难的。 我甚至不得不直接将针管插过他们的衣服来进行注射。
It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there.	在那种高度下，任何其他的办法 都很难奏效。
While I was taking care of them, we got more news about Rob Hall.	正当我照顾这些病人的时候， 我们得到了关于Rob Hall的最新消息。
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.	在当时，我们是无论如何也无法及时赶到他所在的高度去援救他。
He called in to say that he was alone now.	他打电话进来，告诉我们说他现在是独自一人。
Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.	很显然，Doug已经在峰上的某个更高处离世了。
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself, and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude, he was just beyond rescue and he knew it.	但Rob现在已经变得无比虚弱，无法自己爬下山来。 更要命的是，风依旧是如此猛烈，他又在如此高的海拔上， 他是彻底无救了， 而他自己也清楚这一点。
At that point, he asked to be paged into his wife.	在那种情况下， 他请求联系他的妻子。
He was carrying a radio.	他当时携带着一个收音机。
His wife was home in New Zealand, seven months pregnant with their first child, and Rob asked to be patched into her.	她的妻子正守在新西兰的家中， 怀着他们七个月大的第一个孩子。 Rob请求和她连线。
That was done, and Rob and his wife had their last conversation.	我们达成了他的请求。 之后Rob和他的妻子 进行了最后的一次谈话，
They picked the name for their baby.	为他们的孩子选好了名字。
Rob then signed off, and that was the last we ever heard of him.	随后Rob就挂断了， 而那也是我们最后一次听到他的声音。
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at 24,000 feet, which was an impossibility.	我当时所面临的是近乎不可能完成的医疗任务── 在24000英尺的海拔上 医治一群病重的患者。
So what we did was, we got the victims down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.	所以我们到头来做的是，是把这些患者 带到21000英尺的海拔。
It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.	是一个装满了医疗器备的钓具箱。
I had more supplies lower down, which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.	 我已经叫人把这些器备带到低处的营地以便我随后使用。
And this was scene at the lower camp.	而就是当时在低处营地的场景。
The survivors came in one by one.	幸存者们一个个地走进来。
Some of them were hypothermic, some of them were frostbitten, some were both.	他们有些人体温过低， 有些人生了冻疮，而有的则是两者皆具。
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could, put oxygen on them and try to revive them, which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet, when the tent is freezing.	我们试着尽可能地让他们身体暖和起来， 给他们氧气，帮助他们呼吸， 这在21000英尺的海拔上， 在冰冷的帐篷中，并不是一件容易的事。
This is some severe frostbite on the feet, severe frostbite on the nose.	这是脚上的严重冻伤， 还有鼻子上的严重冻伤。
This climber was snow blind.	这个登山者患上了雪盲症。
As I was taking care of these climbers, we got a startling experience.	正当我医治这些登山者的时候， 不可思议的事情发生了。
Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers, who we had already been told was dead, stumbled into the tent, just like a mummy, he walked into the tent.	Beck Weather不知从哪里钻了出来， 我们之前被告知说他已经离世了， 不过他现在竟然像一个木乃伊一样 跌跌跄跄地走进了帐篷中。
I expected him to be incoherent, but, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me, "Hi, Ken.	我本以为他会口齿不清， 但事实上他走进帐篷，对我说到： 嘿，Ken。
Where should I sit?"	我应该坐在哪里？
And then he said, "Do you accept my health insurance?"	随后他又说到： 你接受我的医保不？
He really said that.	那真是他的原话。
So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.	虽然他当时神智很清醒，但却被严重冻伤。
You can see his hand is completely white; his face, his nose, is burned.	你们可以看到，他的手已经全白了， 他的脸和鼻子则是被灼伤了。
First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis, it turns black, and then it falls off.	它先会变白，当到达坏疽的阶段时， 它则会变黑，随后脱落。
It's the last stage, just like a scar.	这是最后的阶段，就像个结疤一样。
So, as I was taking care of Beck, he related what had been going on up there.	就在我照顾Beck的时候， 他向我重述了在峰上所发生的一切。
He said he had gotten lost in the storm, collapsed in the snow, and just laid there, unable to move.	他说他迷失在暴风中， 瘫在了雪中， 然后就躺在那里，无法移动。
Some climbers had come by and looked at him, and he heard them say, "He's dead."	有些登山者经过他身旁，打量了他一番， 然后他听到他们说，他已经死了。
But Beck wasn't dead; he heard that, but he was completely unable to move.	但Beck当时并没有死，他可以听清他们的谈话， 不过他完全无法移动。
He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings, but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.	他处于一种强直性昏厥的状态── 可以感知身边的环境， 却无法通过眨眼这样简单的事情来告诉别人他还活着。
So the climbers passed him by, and Beck lay there for a day, a night and another day, in the snow.	所以登山者们离他而去， Beck躺在那里，一天，一夜， 又一天， 在白雪中。
And then he said to himself, "I don't want to die.	但他告诉自己说： 我不想死。
I have a family to come back to."	我的家人还在等着我。
And the thoughts of his family, his kids and his wife, generated enough energy, enough motivation in him, so that he actually got up.	他对他家人、他的孩子、 他的妻子的思念之情 给予了他充足的力量， 激发了他的动力， 于是他终于站了起来。
After laying in the snow that long a time, he got up and found his way back to the camp.	在雪中躺了那么长一段时间后， 他站了起来，并且找到了回营地的路。
And Beck told me that story very quietly, but I was absolutely stunned by it.	Beck轻声地向我讲述着这个故事， 但我却完全被其打动了。
I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up.	我无法想象任何人可以在雪中 瘫痪那么久， 却依旧可以站起来。
He apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia.	很明显，他逆转了 无法逆转的过低体温。
And I can only try to speculate on how he did it.	而我现在只能猜测 他是如何做到这一点的。
So, what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan, something that could actually measure brain function?	如果我们将Beck连到一个电脑扫描仪上， 来观测他当时的脑部活动， 我们会看到什么呢？
Just very simply, the three parts of the brain: the frontal lobe, where you focus your attention and concentration; you have the temporal lobe, where you form images and keep memories; and the posterior part of your brain, which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion; and the brain stem, where you have your basic maintenance functions, like heartbeat and respiration.	这是简化了的大脑的三个部分： 额叶── 用来集中注意力的组织； 颞叶── 用来构建影像、存储记忆的组织； 而在大脑的后部， 有控制行动的小脑， 以及协调如心跳、呼吸等 这些基本生命机理的 脑干。
So let's take a cut through the brain here, and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan.	所以让我们在这里截取这个大脑的横切片， 想象着Beck就连在 这个大脑扫描仪上，
This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain.	测量着动态血液流动， 也就是大脑中的能量流动。
So you have the prefrontal cortex here, lighting up in red.	这里，前额的大量活动 呈现红色。
This is a pretty evenly distributed scan.	这是一个分配相对平均的脑切片。
You have the middle area, where the temporal lobe might be, in here, and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.	大脑的中部在这里， 颞叶可能就在这里， 这是后脑的部分，基本机理的维护都在后面。
This is a roughly normal scan, showing equal distribution of energy.	这是一个比较正常的脑切片， 能量分布地很平均。
Now, you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up.	再来看看这张切片， 额叶是格外的兴奋。
This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger.	而这就有可能是当Beck意识到自己身处险境时， 所经历的事情。
He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble.	他集中了他所有的注意力， 一心只想脱离险境。
These parts of the brain are quieting down.	大脑这些部分的活动都被减缓。
He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point, and he's working pretty hard.	在这种状况下，他并没有在想着他的家人或是其他任何人， 而是在竭尽全力抗争着。
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.	他正试着重新激活他的肌肉，脱离险境。
OK, but he's losing ground here.	不过他开始败退下来，
He's running out of energy.	他没有足够的能量。
It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going, and, you see, there's no more red here; his brain is quieting down.	天气过于寒冷，他无法维持他的新陈代谢。 如你所见，这里不再是红色的了。 他的大脑开始安静下来。
He's collapsed in the snow here.	他瘫在了雪中。一切都变得鸦雀无声。
Everything is quiet, there's very little red anywhere.	 红色的部分一点点消逝。
Beck is powering down.	Beck的能量一点点流失。
He's dying.	他正一步步接近死亡。
You go on to the next scan, but, in Beck's case, you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again.	不过当我们来到下一张脑切片， 我们会看到 Beck大脑的中间部分 又变得兴奋起来。
He's beginning to think about his family.	他还是回想他的家人。
He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up.	他脑中浮现家人的各种影像 激励他站起来。
He's developing energy in this area through thought.	仅仅通过思考， 他在这个区域中聚集了能量。
And this is how he's going to turn thought back into action.	这就是他如何将思想 转化为行动。
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.	这部分的大脑被称为带状前回。
It's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists.	很多脑部专家相信 这个区域 就是人类意志的所在。
This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.	这是人们做决定、培养意志的地方。
And, you can see, there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain, where he's got images of his family, into this area, which is powering his will.	而且如你们所见，一股能量 正从充满他家人影像的大脑中部 流向 掌管其意志的区域。
Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor.	而这股能量变得越来越强壮 直到它变成了 一个激励他的因素。
He's going to develop enough energy in that area -- after a day, a night and a day -- to actually motivate himself to get up.	在一天、一夜、又一天之后 他将在那个区域积攒足够的能量 来激励他站起来。
And you can see here, he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.	如你所见， 他的额叶开始集聚更多的能量。
He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.	他开始集中精力。他现在可以全神贯注了。
He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.	他在考虑如何拯救自己。
So this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain, and it's getting quieter down here, but he's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going.	所以这股能量已经被转移到 他大脑的前部， 而这部分则变得渐渐安静下来， 不过他正在利用这股能量 来思考一个可以让他重新动起来的办法。
And then, that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas.	而之后，这股能量就好似 在他的思想区域里扩散开来一样。
He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.	他现在不再挂念他的家人，而是在想着如何激励他自己。
This is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving, and he's going to be pacing himself.	这是大脑后部，帮助他的肌肉重新活动起来， 随后他将开始自我调整，
His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.	他的心脏和肺将开始提速。
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic.	如果我们可以将Beck连接在电脑扫描仪上， 我猜想这就是当时在他惊人的求生过程中 所发生的一切。
So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet, and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself.	这是我在海拔21000英尺的地方照顾Beck， 和他所做的一切自救相比 我感觉我所做的是如此微不足道。
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do.	这向你们展示了人类意志的力量。
He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients; luckily, we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys.	他病得很严重。 幸运的是，我们得以获取一架直升飞机 来援救这些人。
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.	一架直升飞机来到21000的海拔处 完成了人类历史上海拔最高的直升机援救。
It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck and the other survivors, one by one, and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp.	它得以降落在冰上，将Beck 以及其他幸存者，一个个地运走， 并在我们赶回大本营之前， 就已经把他们送到了加德满都的一家诊所。
This is a scene at base camp, at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost.	这是在大本营的一幕， 我们遇难的登山者中就有一些 来自其中的一个营地。
And we had a memorial service there a few days later.	几天后，我们在那里 举行了一场悼念仪式。
These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.	这是一些夏尔巴人燃烧杉树枝，
They believe juniper smoke is holy.	因为他们相信杉树的烟是神圣的。
And the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit, turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.	登山者们站在那些高处岩石的四周 追忆那些 在峰顶遇难的同伴们， 转向大山，去和他们直接对话。
There were five climbers lost here.	一共有五名登山者不幸逝世。
This was Scott Fischer, Rob Hall, Andy Harris, Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba.	这是Scott Fischer， Rob Hall， Andy Harris， Doug Hansen 以及Yasuko Namba。
And one more climber should have died that day, but didn't, and that's Beck Weathers.	还有一名登山者 本应在那天逝世，但是却没有， 他就是Beck Weathers。
He was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower, he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself.	而他幸存的原因 就是因为他可以召唤那股难以置信的意志力， 用他所用的精神力量 拯救了自己。
These are Tibetan prayer flags.	这些是藏族的祷告旗。
These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags, the message will be carried up to the gods, and that year, Beck's message was answered.	夏尔巴人们相信 如果你将祷告写在这些旗上面， 你的讯息将会被带往神那里。 而那一年，Beck的祈祷得到了回应。
Thank you.	谢谢。
Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.	Penelope Jagessar Chaffer:我要问声这里是否有医生。
No, I'm just joking.	不问了，开个玩笑。
It's interesting, because it was six years ago when I was pregnant with my first child that I discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body.	很有趣，因为六年前 当我怀第一个宝宝的时候 我发现 最常用的防腐剂 用于婴儿制品 进入人体后 酷似雌性激素。
Now it's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin.	事实上， 产品中的化学合成物 很容易透过皮肤进入人体。
And these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors.	并且，这些防腐剂 已经在乳腺癌肿瘤中发现。
That was the start of my journey to make this film, "Toxic Baby."	这就是我开始 拍摄《中毒宝宝》的起因。
And it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue.	并且，不用花多少时间 就会发现有关这个问题的令人震惊的 统计数字。
One is that you and I all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn't have.	之一就是你和我 体内都带有30至5万种 化学制品 而我们的祖父母却没有的。
And many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we're seeing across industrialized nations.	其中很多的化学成分 现在联系到 工业化国家中常见的 飞速发展的慢性儿童疾病。
I'll show you some statistics.	我给大家看些数据。
So for example, in the United Kingdom, the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.	举个例子，在英国， 儿童白血病的发病率 在一代人中已提高了20%。
Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.	在美国，儿童癌症发病率的增长数字也非常相似
In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.	在加拿大，有十分之一的儿童患有哮喘。
That's a four-fold increase.	这是四倍的增长率。
Again, similar story around the world.	同样，类似的事情在世界各地发生着。
In the United States, probably the most astonishing statistic is a 600 percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities.	在美国， 或许最令人震惊的数据 是自闭症，自闭症障碍 和其他学习障碍 600％的发病增长率。
Again, we're seeing that trend across Europe, across North America.	同样，我们看到这个趋势 在横扫欧洲和北美。
And in Europe, there's certain parts of Europe, where we're seeing a four-fold increase in certain genital birth defects.	在欧洲 某些地区， 我们看到有四倍增长的 一些生殖器先天缺陷案例。
Interestingly, one of those birth defects has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.	有趣的是，其中一种的先天缺陷的案例 在美国已经增长了200%。
So a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes, premature puberty.	同样正在真正激增的还有 慢性儿童疾病 以及其他疾病 譬如肥胖，青少年糖尿病， 早熟。
So it's interesting for me, when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things, that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs.	我感到很有趣的是， 当我寻找一位能够真正和我讨论 并且对听众们谈论这些事的人 并且他可能是这世上很重要的一个 能讨论婴儿体内的毒性的人 却是个青蛙专家。
Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well that I would be talking about pesticides, that I'd be talking about public health, because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.	Tyrone Hayes：我也很吃惊 我会谈论杀虫剂， 我会谈论公共健康， 因为我从来没想过我会做什么有用的事。
Frogs.	青蛙。
In fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was sort of a surprise as well when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if I would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.	其实，我也吃惊会渉入 杀虫剂这个问题。 当时，世上最大的化学制品公司 来问我，是否能评估 阿特拉津对两栖动物或者说我的青蛙的影响。
It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world.	结果呢，原来阿特拉津是 世上最大的化学制品公司的最畅销产品。
It's the number one contaminant of groundwater, drinking water, rain water.	它含量最高的杂质 于地下水，饮用水和雨水。
In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union, but in that same year, the United States EPA re-registered the compound.	在2003年，在我的研究之后，阿特拉津被欧盟禁止了。 但是在同一年， 美国环保署重新注册了这个化合物。
We were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine -- 0.1 parts per billion -- that it produced animals that look like this.	我们的发现令我们小吃一惊 当我们把青蛙暴露在 很低水平的阿特拉津中时，虽然10亿当中只有0.1部分， 创造出了长成这个样子的动物。
These are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes, two ovaries, another large testis, more ovaries, which is not normal ...	动物的生殖腺解剖显示出 它有两个睾丸，两个卵巢， 外加一个大的睾丸，几个卵巢， 这都不正常。
even for amphibians.	即使是对两栖动物来说。
In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.	另外一些例子里，比如一种叫北美豹蚊蛙的物种 在暴露于阿特拉津后雄性的睾丸竟然长有卵子。
And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male's testes.	大家可以看到的这些大个的充满黄的卵子 布满雄性睾丸的外表。
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well, that there's nothing more painful than childbirth -- which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that -- but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five.	我太太告诉我，当然Penelope也会说， 没有比生孩子更痛的事。 生孩子我永远不可能体验，所以我不会争辩这个。 但我会猜想如果我睾丸里有一打的鸡蛋的话， 这疼痛可能会排在前五个最疼痛的经历里面。
In recent studies that we've published, we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine, some of the males grow up and completely become females.	在我们发表的近期研究， 我们展示了当一些动物暴露在阿特拉津下的时候， 一些雄性的成长后 会变成完全的雌性。
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.	所以，有些配偶关系实际上是两兄弟的组合。
And not only do these genetic males mate with other males, they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they're genetic males.	并不只是这些基因雄性和其他雄性交配， 他们实际上还有能力产卵， 尽管他们是基因雄性。
What we proposed, and what we've now generated support for, is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.	我们所提议的 我们也得到了支持， 就是阿特拉津 严重危害而导致荷尔蒙的不平衡。
Normally the testes should make testosterone, the male hormone.	通常睾丸应该产出雄性激素， 就是雄性荷尔蒙。
But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme, the machinery if you will, aromatase, that converts testosterone into estrogen.	但是阿特拉津所做的就是它会开启一种酶， 叫芳香化酶， 它会把雄性激素转化成雌性激素。
And as a result, these exposed males lose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated, and they're subsequently feminized because now they're making the female hormone.	结果就是，这些被暴露过的雄性 就失去了他们的雄性激素，他们是被化学阉制了， 因为他们不断制造雌性激素， 他们就被女性化了。
Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.	现在，这就引到了跟人有关的话题。
Because it turns out that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer, is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.	事实证明 女性中最多的癌症-乳腺癌， 就是受控于雌性激素和芳香化酶。
So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast, aromatase converts androgens into estrogens, and that estrogen turns on or promotes the growth of that cancer so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.	当你乳房里有了一个癌细胞， 芳香化酶就把雄性激素转化成雌性激素， 而那个雌性激素又启动或促进 癌症的成长， 因此它就形成肿块并扩散。
In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole, which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen, so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.	实际上，芳香化酶在乳腺癌上起很关键的作用。 最新的乳腺癌的治疗法， 就是用一种叫来曲唑的化学制品， 来阻止芳香化酶，阻止雌激素， 所以如果你产生了变异的细胞，它不会长成肿瘤。
Now what's interesting is, of course, that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine, the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite -- turns on aromatase, increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.	现在，有趣的是， 我们仍然在用八千万镑的阿特拉津， 饮用水中第一多的杂质，起着相反的作用- 启动芳香化酶，增加雌性激素， 在老鼠身上长肿瘤 在人身上引发的就是肿瘤，乳腺癌。
What's interesting is, in fact, the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine, the breast cancer promoter, now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company.	事实上，更有趣的是， 销售八千万镑的阿特拉津的公司 ——乳腺癌的推广者， 现在又在卖阻滞剂，同一家公司。
And so I find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it, we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment.	我感到有趣的是， 我们对付疾病的方法 不是预防暴露于引发疾病的化学制品 而是简单地 把更多的化学制品投入到环境里。
P So speaking of estrogen, one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol A, BPA, which has been in the news recently.	PJC：说到雌性激素， Tyrone在影片里提到的另一种叫做双酚A的化合物， 即BPA， 最近也有报道。
It's a plasticizer.	它是一种增塑剂。
It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic, which is what baby bottles are made out of.	这种化合物在聚碳酸脂塑料里可见， 婴儿奶瓶就是用这种塑料制作的。
And what's interesting about BPA is that it's such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.	BPA的有趣之处是， 它是一种很有效的雌激素， 曾被考虑用于 人造雌激素来做激素放置疗法。
And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown that BPA leaches from babies' bottles into the formula, into the milk, and therefore into the babies.	已经有过很多很多很多的研究表明 BPA从婴儿奶瓶 渗到婴儿食品，渗进奶水 所以也渗进到宝宝体内。
So we're dosing our babies, our newborns, our infants, with a synthetic estrogen.	所以，我们在给我们的宝宝们， 我们的新生儿们，我们的婴儿们 服用人造雌性激素。
Now two weeks ago or so, the European Union passed a law banning the use of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups.	大约两周前， 欧洲联盟通过一则法律 禁止使用BPA 在婴儿奶瓶和吸管杯中。
And for those of you who are not parents, sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles.	对那些不是父母的说一声 吸管杯就是 宝宝们停止使用奶瓶的后的塑料替代物。
But just two weeks before that, the U.S. Senate refused to even debate the banning of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups.	但，也就是在两周前， 美国参议院竟拒绝 对禁止婴儿奶瓶和吸管杯 使用BPA之事展开辩论。
So it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is.	这也让你们认识到 是父母的义务 去看待这件事，安排和监督 他们自己的生活， 这是很惊人的。
P With many plastic baby bottles now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A, it really shows how sometimes it is only a parent's awareness that stands between chemicals and our children.	PJC：很多的婴儿奶瓶 已经证实有双酚A的渗漏， 也表明有时是 父母的关注 站在化学制品和我们孩子之间。
The baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure.	婴儿奶瓶的情形证明 我们能够防止不必要的接触。
However, if we parents are unaware, we are leaving our children to fend for themselves.	可是，如果我们做父母的不知道， 那我们就让孩子们 照料他们自己去了。
TH: And what Penelope says here is even more true.	TH：Penelop说的 再真实不过了。
For those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.	你们可能还有不知道的，我们是在第六位大规模绝种之中。
Scientists agree now.	科学们都赞成。
We are losing species from the Earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared, and leading that loss are amphibians.	我们地球上物种的流失 比恐龙消失还快 最快的就是两栖类。
80 percent of all amphibians are threatened and in come decline.	所有两栖动物的80% 受到威胁并在减少。
And I believe, many scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline.	我相信，许多的科学家们也相信 杀虫剂是减少的主要原因。
In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water -- no eggshells, no membranes and no placenta.	在一定程度上，两栖动物是很好的指标且更敏感， 因为他们对水中的污染物没有任何保护- 没有蛋壳，没有隔膜 也没有胎盘。
In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals -- one of our big inventions was the placenta.	事实上，我们的发明，--我们意思是我们哺乳动物- 我们的大发明之一就是胎盘。
But we also start out as aquatic organisms.	但我们也是从水中的有机体而来的。
But it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals, the placenta, cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals that it's never seen before.	但事实证明这个古老的结构- 把我们从其他动物分开的结构，胎盘－ 并不能进化或快速适应 我们生产新化学制品的速度－ 一个前所未有的速度。
The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine, show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.	老鼠身上再次用过阿特拉津的研究证据 显示荷尔蒙不平衡的阿特拉津，会导致流产。
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.	因为维护怀孕是依靠荷尔蒙。
Of those rats that don't abort, atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man's disease.	当然老鼠不会流产， 阿特拉津引起幼崽 前列腺疾病 所以说小老鼠一出生就患有老年病。
Of those that don't abort, atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development in the exposed daughters in utero, so that their breast don't develop properly.	对那些不流产的， 阿特拉津会导致不可恢复的乳房受损 在子宫内就遭到阿特拉津接触的女儿们， 她们的乳房不可能正常发育。
And as a result, when those rats grow up, their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.	结果是，这些老鼠成长时， 他们的幼崽会经历成长发育缓慢。 因为她们没有足够的奶水来喂养幼崽。
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to.	你们看到的最下面的小老鼠受的影响 源自它的祖母被暴露于阿特拉津。
And given the life of many of these chemicals, generations, years, dozens of years, that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today.	受这些化学制品影响的的生命， 一代代，一年年，成年累月， 可以说我们今天 会影响到我们孙子的孙子 那一代人的健康 通过现在投入到环境里的东西。
And this is not just philosophical, it's already known, that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen, PCBs, DDT cross the placenta and effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the baby's in the womb.	这并不只是哲理性的，已经众所周知， 化学制品，诸如己烯雌酚，雌激素， PCBs，DDT等 能够穿过胎盘 有效地决定 子宫内胎儿的乳腺癌的发展 以及肥胖和糖尿病 可能性。
In addition to that, after the baby's born, our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they're born.	除此之外，婴儿出生后， 我们哺乳动物的另一个独特的发明 是我们要喂养出世的宝宝。
We already know that chemicals like DDT and DES and atrazine can also pass over into milk, again, affecting our babies even after their born.	我们都已知道化学制品 像DDT，DES和阿特拉津 都能透过容器进入奶水， 在宝宝出生后 还能影响他们。
P So when Tyrone tells me that the placenta is an ancient organ, I'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?	PJC：所以当Tyrone告诉我， 胎盘是个古老的器官， 我就想怎么样来展示它呢？
How do you show that?	如何来表现呢？
And it's interesting when you make a film like this, because you're stuck trying to visualize science that there's no visualization for.	拍电影时有趣的是， 你一直在想用视觉来展示 无法视觉化的科学。
And I have to take a little bit of artistic license.	我只得借助一点艺术特权。
Old man: Placenta control.	老者：这里是胎盘指挥部。
What is it?	胎盘指挥部是什么？
Oh what?	什么？
Puffuffuff, what?	（打呼声） （按喇叭声） 全，全，全--什么？
Perflourooctanoic acid.	全氟辛酸。
Blimey.	啊呀。
Never heard of it.	没听说过。
P And neither had I actually before I started making this film.	PJC：我在开始拍这部影片的时候 也没听说过。
And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child, it made me start to think, what would my fetus say to me?	当你意识到化学成分会穿过胎盘 进入你未出世的婴孩， 这让我开始思考， 我的胎儿要对我说什么？
What would our unborn children say to us when they have an exposure that's happening everyday, day after day?	当我们未出世的孩子们 每天都被暴露于化学品之中， 他们会对我们说什么？
Today, I had some octyphenols, some artificial musks and some bisphenol A.	小孩：今天， 我吃了些辛基酚， 吃了些人造麝香 和一些双酚A。
Help me.	救救我！
P It's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this.	PJV：我们女人 是站在前沿， 知道这点有很深的意义。
This is our issue, because we collect these compounds our entire life and then we end up dumping it and dumping them into our unborn children.	这是我们的问题， 因为我们有毕生时间收集了这些化合物 最终把它们倒给 我们为未出世的孩子。
We are in effect polluting our children.	我们实际上 在污染我们的孩子。
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when I found out I was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat.	这就是一年前发生在我身上的事。 我知道怀孕后 做的第一次扫描就显示 我的宝宝有先天性缺陷， 是与子宫里的 含雌性激素的化学成分有关。 第二次的扫描 宝宝没有心跳。
So my child's death, my baby's death, really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.	我的孩子的死，我宝宝的死亡 真正引起我要拍这部电影的共鸣。
And it's sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story, which is not what you originally intend.	有时很奇怪， 本来不在计划之中的传播者 却成了故事的一部分。
And so when Tyrone talks about the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment, this is my contaminated environment.	当Tyrone讲 胎儿被困在受污染的环境里， 这个就是我的被污染了环境。
This is my toxic baby.	这是我的中了毒的宝宝。
And that's something that's just profound and sad, but astonishing because so many of us don't actually know this.	这件事 很深刻和令人伤心的 但令人吃惊的 是因为我们很多人还不知道。
TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at TEDWomen is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them, 'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'"	TH：能够来到TEDwomen对我 是很兴奋和合适的一件事， 昨天晚餐时有一位总结的很好， 他说：转身对你的邻座说 当革命开始时，我们挺你。
The truth is, women, you've had our back on this issue for a very long time, starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future" to Sandra Steingraber's books "Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."	 从Rachel Carson的《安静的春天》开始， 到Theo Colborn 的《失窃的未来》， 和Sandra Steingraber（桑德拉·斯坦格雷伯）的 《下游生活》和《相信》。
And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation -- like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago -- perhaps it's that connection that makes women activists in this particular area.	这也许是我们与下一代人的连系 就像13年前我太太和我漂亮的女儿， 也许这种连接 使更多的妇女活动家 投身到这个特殊的领域。
But for the men here, I want to say it's not just women and children that are at risk.	对这里的男士，我想说 并不只是妇女和孩子身处危险。
And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine, the testes are full of holes and spaces, because the hormone imbalance, instead of allowing sperm to be generated, such as in the testis here, the testicular tubules end up empty and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.	被暴露在阿特拉津的青蛙， 睾丸上布满洞和空隙， 由于荷尔蒙不平衡， 睾丸本来应该产生精子的， 这里的睾丸小管 却空空， 所以生育力跌落到50%。
It's not just my work in amphibians, but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe, holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America and in rats, an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well.	并不只是两栖动物， 在欧洲我们看到鱼类， 在南美我们也发现爬行类和老鼠 都存在睾丸穿孔， 无精子的情况。
And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans, but just by coincidence, my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine.	当然，我们不在人身上做试验。 但巧的是， 我的同事发现 精子数量和质量都低下的男士的尿样里 含有较高的阿特拉津。
These are just men who live in an agricultural community.	这些男士都居住 在农业社区。
Men who actually work in agriculture have much higher levels of atrazine.	从事农业的男士 含有更高水平的阿特拉津。
And the men who actually apply atrazine have even more atrazine in their urine, up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men.	那些实际上喷洒阿特拉津的人， 尿液里的阿特拉津的含量 是我们能够测出的现有的人 的24000倍。
Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.	当然，其中90%的是墨西哥人和墨西哥-美国人。
And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.	他们并不只接触阿特拉津。
They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin, which was originally used as a nerve gas.	他们也接触本来用作神经毒气的化学制品 例如氯化苦。
And many of these workers have life expectancies of only 50.	这些工人很多 只能活到50岁。
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us, just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.	并不吃惊野生动物 也在警告我们， 就像雷切尔·卡森和别的科学家都已警告过一样。
As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda, the agricultural runoff from this crop, which goes into these buckets, is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.	这张幻灯片的证据来自乌干达的那布加波湖， 农作物的流出物 接进到这些水桶， 这是这个村的唯一水源，用来饮用，做饭和梳洗。
Now if I told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes, the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear.	如果我告诉这个村里的人， 青蛙有免疫功能问题， 它们的睾丸里长有卵子， 那么环境健康和公众健康的关系 就显而易见了。
You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it.	你不会去喝你知道会影响 野生动物的水。
The problem is, in my village, Oakland, in most of our villages, we don't see that connection.	问题是，在奥克兰我的村里， 在我们大多数的村子里 我们看不到这种关系。
We turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe, and we assume that we are masters of our environment, rather than being part of it.	我们打开水龙头，水就出来，我们就认为它是安全的。 我们自以为是环境的主人， 而不是当中的一部分。
P So it doesn't take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue.	PJC：不难看出 这实际上是个环境问题。
And I kept thinking over and over again this question.	我曾反复思考 这个问题。
We know so much about global warming and climate change, and yet, we have no concept of what I've been calling internal environmentalism.	我们知道全球温暖化和气候变化 但我们对 我一直称呼的内部环境保护论一无所知。
We know what we're putting out there, we have a sense of those repercussions, but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things, or things are put into our bodies.	我们很清楚我们在往外放什么东西， 我们也感觉到它们的影响， 我们却忽视这种感觉 但当我们往外放东西发生什么 或吃东西时。
And it's my feeling and it's my urging being here to know that, as we women move forward as the communicators of this, but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children, bearing the children, we hold most of the buying power in the household, is that it's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.	我的感受 和我的迫切， 让我们妇女要出去 作为传达者， 我们也要负担 养育孩子的重担， 我们是家庭的主要力量， 所以我们也要再走出一步 去承担一些Tyrone和世界的其它科学家们所做的工作。
And my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps, but it's also about our children as well.	我的迫切要求是 当我们考虑环境问题的时候， 记住并不只是消融的冰川，冰冠， 也关乎我们的孩子。
Thank you.	谢谢大家！
The entire model of capitalism and the economic model that you and I did business in, and, in fact, continue to do business in, was built around what probably Milton Friedman put more succinctly.	资本主义运作的整个模式 以及你我过去和现在 以及你我过去和现在 做生意的经济模式， 是基于这样一个概念。 这个概念米尔顿·弗里德曼 可能说得更简洁，
And Adam Smith, of course, the father of modern economics actually said many, many years ago, the invisible hand, which is, "If you continue to operate in your own self-interest you will do the best good for society."	当然，亚当·斯密，现代经济学之父 在很多很多年前就说过， 也就是无形的手， 这是说，如果每个人都 追求自身利益， 这有助于实现公共福祉。
Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things and I've talked about a lot of good things that have happened, but equally, it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we've seen in society.	现在，资本主义做了很多好事， 而且我也提到了很多发生过的好事， 但另一方面，它还是没有办法 解决我们社会中面临的一些 挑战。
The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G's of growth: growth that is consistent, quarter on quarter; growth that is competitive, better than the other person; and growth that is profitable, so you continue to make more and more shareholder value.	这个我和在座的大多数都熟悉的商业模式 这个我和在座的大多数都熟悉的商业模式 就是我提到过的 我称之为的3G增长模式： 可持续的增长， 一个季度接着一个季度； 有竞争力的增长， 做到比其他人都好； 以及有利可图的增长， 所以你持续地创造 股东价值。
And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this 3G model to a model of what I call the fourth G: the G of growth that is responsible.	但是我不得不说只做到这些已经不够了， 我们需要从这个3G模式 转变到一个我称之为的 4G模式： 一种负责任的增长。
And it is this that has to become a very important part of creating value.	而且这必须是创造价值过程中 一个非常重要的 组成部分。
Of not just creating economic value but creating social value.	也就是不仅要创造经济价值 也要有社会价值。
And companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth G.	那些真正会变强大的公司会是 那些真正做到第四个G的。
And the model of 4G is quite simple: Companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders in what's happening around in society.	而且这个4G模式其实非常简单： 公司不能再充当无辜的旁观者 而无视社会上正在发生的一切。
They have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them.	他们需要开始负起自己的责任 来服务社区 － 那些真正支撑他们的人们。
And we have to move to a model of an and/and model which is how do we make money and do good?	而且我们需要转变到 一个双赢的模式，一个 我们如何又赚钱又做好事的模式？
How do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us?	我们如何才能保证 我们的生意兴隆 但同时我们也共同营造一个良好的环境呢？
And that model is all about doing well and doing good.	而那个模式 就是关于如果能够做强做好。
But the question is easier said than done.	但是问题说起来容易做起来难。
But how do we actually get that done?	我们怎么才能做到这一点呢？
And I do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership.	我坚信 这个问题的答案就是领导力。
It is going to be to redefine the new business models which understand that the only license to operate is to combine these things.	它要重新定义 新的商业模式， 这个模式强调 要想从事商业运营， 就必须把这些方面结合起来。
And for that you need businesses that can actually define their role in society in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell.	也就是你需要那些可以 真正定义自己的社会角色 的公司， 它们能从更大的社会使命角度考虑， 而不仅是从自身的产品和品牌出发。
And companies that actually define a true north, things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good, bad, ugly -- doesn't matter.	那些能够找到自身方向的公司， 有着容不得商量的事情， 不管世道如何变化－ 都不会改变的一些东西。
There are things that you stand for.	你坚信着一些事情。
Values and purpose are going to be the two drivers of software that are going to create the companies of tomorrow.	价值和目标会是 两个软驱动， 它们会创造出 未来的公司。
And I'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences.	我现在来 谈谈我自身的一些体验。
I joined Unilever in 1976 as a management trainee in India.	1976年，我作为一个管理培训生 加入了联合利华在印度的分部。
And on my first day of work I walked in and my boss tells me, "Do you know why you're here?"	我上班第一天 我的主管告诉我， 你知道你为什么在这里吗？
I said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap."	我说，我来这里卖很多的肥皂。
And he said, "No, you're here to change lives."	然后他说，不，你是来改变生活的。
You're here to change lives.	你是来改变生活的。
You know, I thought it was rather facetious.	你知道，我当时认为这太扯了。
We are a company that sells soap and soup.	我们是个卖肥皂和汤的公司。
What are we doing about changing lives?	我们怎么能改变生活？
And it's then I realized that simple acts like selling a bar of soap can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies.	但就是那时我认识到了 简单的举动 比如卖一块肥皂 可以比制药公司 拯救更多的生命。
I don't know how many of you know that five million children don't reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap.	我不知道在座有多少人知道 五百万孩子活不过5岁 只因为简单的感染，而那些感染 通过用肥皂洗手就可以预防。
We run the largest hand-washing program in the world.	我们发起了 全世界最大的 洗手 项目。
We are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people.	我们也在运营着一个关于卫生与健康的项目， 目前已经影响了5亿人。
It's not about selling soap, there is a larger purpose out there.	这不仅仅是卖肥皂， 我们有一个更大的目标。
And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change.	而品牌真的可以 处在社会变革的最前沿。
And the reason for that is, when two billion people use your brands that's the amplifier.	原因是， 当有20亿人用你的品牌时， 那就是很好的品牌效应。
Small actions can make a big difference.	小举动可以产生大变化。
Take another example, I was walking around in one of our villages in India.	再举一个例子， 我在印度的一个村子里走着。
Now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park.	你们中有过这样经历的 会知道这可不像是在公园里散步。
And we had this lady who was one of our small distributors -- beautiful, very, very modest, her home -- and she was out there, dressed nicely, her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind and her sister-in-law behind her.	我们有一位女士 曾经是我们的一个小的经销商 － 她很漂亮，很谦虚，她的家 － 而她就站在外面， 穿着非常得体， 她的丈夫在她身后，然后是她的婆婆以及 她的小姑子。
The social order was changing because this lady is part of our Project Shakti that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene.	社会秩序正在改变 因为这位女士 是我们沙克蒂项目的参与者。 这个项目教妇女 如何做小生意 以及如何传播普及 卫生与健康知识。
We have 60,000 such women now in India.	现在我们有6万这样的妇女 在印度。
It's not about selling soap, it's about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people's lives.	这不是关于卖肥皂， 这是关于确保 在这个过程中 你可以改变其他人的生活。
Small actions, big difference.	小举动，大改变。
Our R&amp;D folks are not only working to give us some fantastic detergents, but they're working to make sure we use less water.	我们的研发团队 不仅仅是为了创造美妙的洗涤剂， 而是为了保证我们可以少用水。
A product that we've just launched recently, One Rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes.	我们最近开发的一个清洗产品， 它可以在你每次洗衣服的时候 节约用水。
And if we can convert all our users to using this, that's 500 billion liters of water.	如果我们可以让我们所有的用户都使用这个产品， 那就是五千亿升的水啊。
By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent.	顺便说一句，这相当于一整个大陆 一个月的用水量。
So just think about it.	大家想想看吧。
There are small actions that can make a big difference.	小举动可以产生巨大的变化。
And I can go on and on.	我还可以举很多例子。
Our food chain, our brilliant products -- and I'm sorry I'm giving you a word from the sponsors -- Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.	我们的食品供应链， 我们的伟大的产品－ 不好意思给大家插播一下广告－ 家乐牌、家乐以及这些很棒的产品们。
We are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources, 100-percent sustainable sources.	我们致力于确保 我们所有的农业原材料 都来自可持续发展的环境， 百分之百。
We were the first to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources.	我们是最早 宣布要从可持续的环境中采购 我们所有的棕榈油的。
I don't know how many of you know that palm oil, and not buying it from sustainable sources, can create deforestation that is responsible for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.	不知道有多少人了解 不从可持续的环境中获取棕榈油， 会造成森林的过度砍伐从而产生 全球20％的温室气体。
We were the first to embrace that, and it's all because we market soap and soup.	我们是第一家做出改变的公司， 这都是因为我们卖肥皂和汤。
And the point I'm making here is that companies like yours, companies like mine have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate.	我的意思是说 像你我的公司 必须要确定一个目标， 这个目标要负有责任感 同时明白我们需要 在我们所处的社会里起到一定作用。
We introduced something called The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said, "Our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace, and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over 2020."	我们提出了一个叫做 联合利华可持续生活计划， 我们的目标是创造一个可持续生活的共同家园， 我们要在2020年改变10亿人的 生活状态。
Now the question here is, where do we go from here?	现在的问题是， 我们要怎么做到这点呢？
And the answer to that is very simple: We're not going to change the world alone.	答案很简单： 我们不能仅靠一己之力来改变世界。
There are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this.	有很有的你和我 明白这一点。
The question is, we need partnerships, we need coalitions and importantly, we need that leadership that will allow us to take this from here and to be the change that we want to see around us.	问题是， 我们需要合作，我们需要联盟， 非常重要的是，我们需要一种领导力， 它可以带领我们 一起改变世界 并从改变我们自己做起。
Thank you very much.	非常感谢大家。
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy, and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me.	当飓风桑迪来袭时，我正在纽约 和一只名叫毛伊的小白狗 待在一起
Half the city was dark because of a power cut, and I was living on the dark side.	由于停电，半个城市处于黑暗中 我当时就在黑暗的这一边
Now, Maui was terrified of the dark, so I had to carry him up the stairs, actually down the stairs first, for his walk, and then bring him back up.	毛伊非常怕黑 我只好把它抱上楼 实际上是先带下楼去遛 再把它抱回来
For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym.	为了洗个澡，我得走40个路口 到一个健身中心去。
But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.	但这些并不是我一天中最重要的任务
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices.	对我来说同样重要的还有能否第一个 带上充电线到附近的一家咖啡馆 给我的多个设备充电。
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.	我开始寻找面包店长椅下 和糕点店入口处的那些插座
I wasn't the only one.	我并不是唯一一个
Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street.	即使下着雨，也有人打着雨伞站在 麦迪逊和第五大道之间的街边插座旁 等着自己的手机充电
Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology, and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.	大自然提醒着我们 它比所有的技术来的强大 但我们仍然沉迷于上网。
I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not, and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter.	我认为没有什么能够比一场危机 更能告诉你事物的轻重缓急 飓风桑迪使我认识到我们的电子设备 及其通讯功能对我的重要程度 就如食物和住所一般
The self as we once knew it no longer exists, and I think that an abstract, digital universe has become a part of our identity, and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.	我们所熟知的一部分自己已经不复存在 而一个抽象的数字的世界 已经成为了我们身份的一部分 我想谈谈这意味着什么
I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common.	我是一个小说家，我对关于自我的话题感兴趣 因为自我和小说有很多共同点
They're both stories, interpretations.	他们都属于一种故事和诠释
You and I can experience things without a story.	你和我可以不通过故事体验事情
We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless.	我们可能爬楼梯爬得太快 我们可能呼吸困难
But the larger sense that we have of our lives, the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.	但我们越是深入地感受我们的生活 就越是感受到其抽象和不直接
Our story of our life is based on direct experience, but it's embellished.	我们关于生活的故事都来自于经历 但是修饰过的
A novel needs scene after scene to build, and the story of our life needs an arc as well.	小说需要一个接一个的场景来完成 我们生活的故事同样需要一道时间跨度
It needs months and years.	需要数月甚至数年的
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.	独立生活场景来组成一个个章节
But the story is not about these chapters.	但故事并不是仅仅是这些章节
It's the whole book.	而是整整一本书
It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but it's because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves.	不仅仅是伤心和愉悦 也不仅仅是胜利和失望 而是所有的前因后果 有时候，也许更加重要的是，尽管有此种种 我们寻找自己在世界中的位置 然后改变这个位置，改变自我
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment.	我们的故事，因此，需要一个二维的时间轴： 一个是我们整个的生命 以及另一个就是直接经历的时间片段 便是某个时刻
Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment, but the one that narrates needs several moments, a whole sequence of them, and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time.	现在直接经历的那个自我 只存在于某个时刻 但一个故事需要多个时刻组成 多个有序的时刻 这就是为何完整的自我认识 同时包括深入地体验 和时间的流逝
Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose.	时间的流逝镌刻于每一件事情中 无论是一粒沙尘的消逝 还是一朵玫瑰的缓缓绽放
Without it, we would have no music.	没有时间的流逝，我们无法获得音乐
Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time, regret or nostalgia about the past, hope or dread about the future.	我们自己的情绪和意识 往往同时间紧密相连 无论是对过去的悔恨或怀念 或是对未来的希望和担心
I think that technology has altered that flow of time.	我认为科技已经改变的时间的流逝
The overall time that we have for our narrative, our lifespan, has been increasing, but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.	我们人生中用在叙事上的时间 增加了 但时间的片段和瞬间，却简短了
It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time, and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world, and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers.	因为我们的设备让我们 能够度量越来越小的时间片段 这反过来又给了我们一个更细粒度的理解 物质世界 这种细粒度的理解 产生了大量的数据 我们的大脑不能处理了 这就导致我们需要越来越复杂的电脑。
All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen.	这一切就是说明 我们可以理解世界的和我们可以度量的世界之间的鸿沟 越来越大了。
Science can do things with and in a picosecond, but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second.	科技可以实现在皮秒下完成工作， 可是你我却没有可能感受到 百万分之百万分之一秒。
You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow, to the sun, the moon and the seasons, and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past, the present and the future to see things for what they are, to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations.	你我，只能感受到自然的变化节奏， 太阳，月亮，季节 这需要很长的时间跨度 包括过去，现在和未来 分清事物， 从噪声中剥离出信号 从感觉中辨析自我。
We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations.	我们需要时间箭头的方向辨析因果， 不仅在物质世界里， 还在我们自己的内在世界。
What happens when that arrow goes awry?	时间箭头的方向出错了会如何？
What happens when time warps?	时间扭曲了会如何？
So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once.	我们现今有许多感觉 时间箭头指向了所有方向 同时又没有指向任何方向。
This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one.	这是因为数字世界中时间 不会像在现实世界中一样流淌。
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time.	我们知道互联网拉近了空间 和时间。
Far away over there is now here.	遥远的地方就在身边。
News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.	来自印度的消息流入我的智能手机应用程序 不管我在纽约还是在新德里。
And that's not all.	这还不是全部。
Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year, your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends, because the Internet also archives, and it warps the past.	你上一份工作，你去年的订餐记录， 你以前的朋友，和现如今的朋友并排在一个屏幕上， 因为互联网会存档， 它扭曲了过去。
With no distinction left between the past, the present and the future, and the here or there, we are left with this moment everywhere, this moment that I'll call the digital now.	没法区分过去， 现在和未来，此处和彼处， 我们这一刻无处不在， 这一刻，我称之为数字当下
Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now?	我们如何在数字当下中 区分优先级呢？
This digital now is not the present, because it's always a few seconds ahead, with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones.	数字当下不是现在， 因为它总是超前几秒， 推特推送了来自 其它时区的新闻。
This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.	数字当下不再是现在，有切肤之感、 或者品味糕点的时刻、 或者是三个小时流连于好书中间。
This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state.	数字当下很少参照我们自身 生理或心理的状态。
Its focus, instead, is to distract us at every turn on the road.	数字当下使我们 在每个路口分心。
Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else.	每个数字路标都是一个岔路 会使我们到其它地方去 做其它事。

Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose.	旅行是自由的， 但当它变得不停不歇， 我们就变成了永久的流亡者，没有些许喘息。
Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly for its own sake.	选择是自由的，但无时无刻的选择就 不是自由了。
Not just is the digital now far from the present, but it's in direct competition with it, and this is because not just am I absent from it, but so are you.	数字当下不仅远离现在， 而且它也在于现在竞争， 这不仅仅是因为我脱离了现在， 而且你们也是。
Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.	不仅是因为我们脱离了现在，每个其他人都是。
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.	这就是最大的便利和恐怖所在
I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night, shop for Parisian macarons, and leave video messages that get picked up later.	我可以在午夜订外文书， 买巴黎的法国小圆饼， 留视频信息，稍后接收。
At all times, I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you, while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time.	在任何时候,我可以 以与你不同的节奏和速度操作， 当我还沉浸在这样 与你们实时互动的幻境中的时候。
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter.	桑迪飓风提醒了我们 幻境可以被粉碎。
There were those with power and water, and those without.	居所分为有水有电的 和没有的。
There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months.	有些人回到他们的生活， 经过许多个月 还有些人仍然无法上网。
For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true.	出于某种原因,技术似乎给我们一种 每个人都拥有一样条件的幻觉， 然后，一个讽刺的耳光， 它现出原形。
For example, it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets.	例如：据说在印度 有手机的人比有抽水马桶的人多。
Now if this rift, which is already so great in many parts of the world, between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology, isn't somehow bridged, there will be ruptures between the digital and the real.	这样的鸿沟，已经如此巨大 在世界很多地方， 那里往往缺少基础设施， 但技术进步的脚步已经捷足先登。 但假如这两者之间的鸿沟不被连接的话， 将会带来巨大的断层。
For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous.	对于我们那些醒着的时间 生活在数字当下中的人， 挑战在于生活在 两个并行同时存在的时间流中。
How does one live inside distraction?	一个人如何生活在分心中?
We might think that those younger than us, those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.	我们也许会想年轻人会比我们好些， 他们出生于数字时代，会自然的适应。
Possibly, but I remember my childhood.	也许，但是我记起了我的童年。
I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me.	我记得我祖父告诉我 世界各地的首都。
Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube, and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.	布达和佩斯是被多瑙河分割开的， 维也纳有个西班牙马术学校。
If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks, but it really wouldn't be the same, because much later, I went to Vienna, and I went to the Spanish riding school, and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.	如果我是当下的小孩子，我会很快知道这些信息 利用互联网， 但体验绝不会是相同的， 因为，多年后，去维也纳， 我去了那间西班牙马术学校， 我感觉我祖父就在我身边。
Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.	夜复一夜，他带我到阳台上， 在他的肩膀上，指点我木星 土星和大熊星座。
And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.	即使在这里，当我看到大熊星座时， 我会回想起小时候， 在他头顶上，努力 在他肩膀上保持平衡， 我能再次回想到小时候。
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact.	我和我的祖父的过往 夹杂着信息和知识和事实， 但这些意味着更多 超越信息和知识和事实。
Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core, because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable.	时间扭曲技术 挑战我们最深层的内核， 因为我们可以记录过去 有些东西变得难以忘却， 即使在当下 越来越不容易记住。
We want to clutch, and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments.	我们希望抓住关键时刻，取而代之我们希望抓住关键时刻的 变成了一串静止时刻。

I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.	我第一次体验到它是和我的祖母。
I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it.	我想学会跳绳,她找出一条老绳 把纱丽扎起来 然后跳了过去。
I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen, cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.	我想学做菜，她就和我 在厨房里切了一个月的菜。
My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention.	我的祖母教会了我事情发生在 它们占用的时间上， 时间不可战胜， 因为时间是时不我待的， 我们拥有现在用我们的注意力

When I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time.	当我九岁的时候 我第一次去参加夏令营
And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books, which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do.	我妈妈帮我整理好了我的行李箱 里面塞满了书 这对于我来说是一件极为自然的事情
Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity.	因为在我的家庭里 阅读是主要的家庭活动
And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just a different way of being social.	听上去你们可能觉得我们是不爱交际的 但是对于我的家庭来说这真的只是接触社会的另一种途径
You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you, but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind.	你们有自己家庭接触时的温暖亲情 家人静坐在你身边 但是你也可以自由地漫游 在你思维深处的冒险乐园里
And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this, but better.	我有一个想法 野营会变得像这样子，当然要更好些
I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.	我想象到十个女孩坐在一个小屋里 都穿着合身的女式睡衣惬意地享受着读书的过程
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.	野营这时更像是一个不提供酒水的派对聚会
And on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.	在第一天的时候呢 我们的顾问把我们都集合在一起 并且她教会了我们一种今后要用到的庆祝方式 在余下夏令营的每一天中 让露营精神浸润我们
And it went like this: "R-O-W-D-I-E, that's the way we spell rowdie.	之后它就像这样继续着 R-O-W-D-I-E 这是我们拼写吵闹的口号
Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."	我们唱着噪音，喧闹，我们要变得吵一点
But I recited a cheer.	但是我可没有忘记庆祝。
I recited a cheer along with everybody else.	我与每个人都互相欢呼庆祝了
I did my best.	我尽了我最大的努力
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books.	我只是想等待那一刻 我可以离开吵闹的聚会去捧起我挚爱的书
But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase, the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?"	但是当我第一次把书从行李箱中拿出来的时候 床铺中最酷的那个女孩向我走了过来 并且她问我：为什么你要这么安静？
-- mellow, of course, being the exact opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E.	 安静，当然，是R-O-W-D-I-E的反义词 喧闹的反义词
And then the second time I tried it, the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing.	而当我第二次拿书的时候 我们的顾问满脸忧虑的向我走了过来 接着她重复了关于露营精神的要点 并且说我们都应当努力 去变得外向些
And so I put my books away, back in their suitcase, and I put them under my bed, and there they stayed for the rest of the summer.	于是我放好我的书 放回了属于它们的行李箱中 并且我把它们放到了床底下 在那里它们度过了暑假余下的每一天
And I felt kind of guilty about this.	我对这样做感到很愧疚
I felt as if the books needed me somehow, and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.	不知为什么我感觉这些书是需要我的 它们在呼唤我，但是我却放弃了它们
But I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer.	我确实放下了它们，并且我再也没有打开那个箱子 直到我和我的家人一起回到家中 在夏末的时候
Now, I tell you this story about summer camp.	现在，我向你们讲述这个夏令营的故事
I could have told you 50 others just like it -- all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go, that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.	我完全可以给你们讲出其他50种版本就像这个一样的故事-- 每当我感觉到这样的时候 它告诉我出于某种原因，我的宁静和内向的风格 并不是正确道路上的必需品 我应该更多地尝试一个外向者的角色
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.	并且我总是去那些拥挤的酒吧 当我只是想要和朋友们吃一顿愉快的晚餐时
And I made these self-negating choices so reflexively, that I wasn't even aware that I was making them.	我做出了这些自我否认的抉择 如条件反射一般 甚至我都不清楚我做出了这些决定
Now this is what many introverts do, and it's our loss for sure, but it is also our colleagues' loss and our communities' loss.	这就是很多内向的人正在做的事情 这当然是我们的损失 但这同样也是同事们的损失 我们所在团队集体的损失
And at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss.	当然，冒着被指为夸大其词的风险我想说，更是世界的损失
Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best.	因为当涉及创造和领导的时候 我们需要内向的人做到最好
A third to a half of the population are introverts -- a third to a half.	三分之一到二分之一的人都是内向的-- 三分之一到二分之一
So that's one out of every two or three people you know.	你要知道这可意味着每两到三个人中就有一个内向的
So even if you're an extrovert yourself, I'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society.	所以即使你自己是一个外向的人 我正在说你的同事 和你的配偶和你的孩子 还有现在正坐在你旁边的那个家伙-- 他们都要屈从于这样的偏见 一种在我们的社会中已经扎根的现实偏见
We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing.	我们从很小的时候就把它藏在内心最深处 甚至都不说几句话，关于我们正在做的事情
Now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is.	现在让我们来清楚地看待这种偏见 我们需要真正了解内向到底指什么
It's different from being shy.	它和害羞是不同的
Shyness is about fear of social judgment.	害羞是对于社会评论的恐惧
Introversion is more about, how do you respond to stimulation, including social stimulation.	内向更多的是 你怎样对于刺激作出回应 包括来自社会的刺激
So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation, whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they're in quieter, more low-key environments.	其实内向的人是很渴求大量的鼓舞和激励的 反之内向者最感觉到他们的存在 这是他们精力最充足的时候，最具有能力的时候 当他们存在于更安静的，更低调的环境中
Not all the time -- these things aren't absolute -- but a lot of the time.	并不是所有时候--这些事情都不是绝对的-- 但是存在于很多时候
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us.	所以说，关键在于 把我们的天赋发挥到最大化 这对于我们来说就足够把我们自己 放到对于我们正确又合适的激励的区域中去
But now here's where the bias comes in.	但是现在偏见出现了
Our most important institutions, our schools and our workplaces, they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.	我们最重要的那些体系 我们的学校和工作单位 它们都是为性格外向者设计的 并且有适合他们需要的刺激和鼓励
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink, which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place.	当然我们现在也有这样一种信用机制 我称它为新型的团队思考 这是一种包含所有创造力和生产力的思考方式 从一个社交非常零散的地方产生的
So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays: When I was going to school, we sat in rows.	当你描绘今天典型教室的图案时 当我还上学的时候 我们一排排地坐着
We sat in rows of desks like this, and we did most of our work pretty autonomously.	我们靠着桌子一排排坐着就像这样 并且我们大多数工作都是自觉完成的
But nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other.	但是在现代社会，所谓典型的教室 是些圈起来并排的桌子-- 四个或是五个或是六、七个孩子坐在一起，面对面
And kids are working in countless group assignments.	孩子们要完成无数个小组任务
Even in subjects like math and creative writing, which you think would depend on solo flights of thought, kids are now expected to act as committee members.	甚至像数学和创意写作这些课程 这些你们认为需要依靠个人闪光想法的课程 孩子们现在却被期待成为小组会的成员
And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone, those kids are seen as outliers often or, worse, as problem cases.	对于那些喜欢 独处，或者自己一个人工作的孩子来说 这些孩子常常被视为局外人 或者更糟，被视为问题孩子
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert, even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable, according to research.	并且很大一部分老师的报告中都相信 最理想的学生应该是外向的 相对于内向的学生而言 甚至说外向的学生能够取得更好的成绩 更加博学多识 据研究报道
Okay, same thing is true in our workplaces.	好了。同样的事情也发生在我们工作的地方
Now, most of us work in open plan offices, without walls, where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers.	现在呢，我们中的绝大多数都工作在宽阔没有隔间的办公室里 甚至没有墙 在这里，我们暴露 在不断的噪音和我们同事的凝视目光下工作
And when it comes to leadership, introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions, even though introverts tend to be very careful, much less likely to take outsize risks -- which is something we might all favor nowadays.	而当谈及领袖气质的时候 内向的人总是按照惯例从领导的位置被忽视了 尽管内向的人是非常小心仔细的 很少去冒特大的风险-- 这些风险是今天我们可能都喜欢的
And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do, because when they are managing proactive employees, they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas, whereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly, get so excited about things that they're putting their own stamp on things, and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface.	宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院的亚当·格兰特教授做了一项很有意思的研究 这项研究表明内向的领导们 相对于外向领导而言总是会生产更大的效益 因为当他们管理主动积极的雇员的时候 他们更倾向于让有主见的雇员去自由发挥 反之外向的领导就可能，当然是不经意的 对于事情变得十分激动 他们在事务上有了自己想法的印迹 这使其他人的想法可能就不会很容易地 在舞台上发光了
Now in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.	事实上，历史上一些有改革能力的领袖都是内向的人
I'll give you some examples.	我会举一些例子给你们
Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi -- all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.	埃莉诺·罗斯福，罗沙·帕克斯，甘地 -- 所有这些人都把自己描述成 内向，说话温柔甚至是害羞的人
And they all took the spotlight, even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to.	他们仍然站在了聚光灯下 即使他们浑身上下 都感知他们说不要
And this turns out to have a special power all its own, because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm, not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at; they were there because they had no choice, because they were driven to do what they thought was right.	这证明是一种属于它自身的特殊的力量 因为人们都会感觉这些领导者同时是掌舵者 并不是因为他们喜欢指挥别人 抑或是享受众人目光的聚焦 他们处在那个位置因为他们没有选择 因为他们行驶在他们认为正确的道路上
Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts.	现在我觉得对于这点我有必要说 那就是我真的喜爱外向的人
I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts, including my beloved husband.	我总是喜欢说我最好的几个朋友都是外向的人 包括我亲爱的丈夫
And we all fall at different points, of course, along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.	当然了我们都会在不同点时偏向 内向者/外向者的范围
Even Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms, said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert.	甚至是卡尔·荣格，这个让这些名词为大众所熟知的心理学家，说道 世上绝没有一个纯粹的内向的人 或者一个纯粹的外向的人
But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.	同时我想说从文化意义上讲我们需要一种更好的平衡
And what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance.	我们需要更多的阴阳的平衡 在这两种类型的人之间
We need more of a yin and yang between these two types.	这点是极为重要的 当涉及创造力和生产力的时候 因为当心理学家们看待 最有创造力的人的生命的时候 他们寻找到的 是那些擅长变换思维的人 提出想法的人 但是他们同时也有着极为显著的偏内向的痕迹
This is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity, because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people, what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas, but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them.	这是因为独处是非常关键的因素 对于创造力来说
And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity.	所以达尔文 自己一个人漫步在小树林里 并且断然拒绝了晚餐派对的邀约
So Darwin, he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations.	西奥多·盖索，更多时候以苏索博士的名号知名 他梦想过很多的惊人的创作 在他在加利福尼亚州拉霍亚市房子的后面的 一座孤独的束层的塔形办公室中
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time.	史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克发明了第一台苹果电脑 一个人独自坐在他的机柜旁 在他当时工作的惠普公司
And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up.	并且他说他永远不会在那方面成为一号专家 但他还没因太内向到要离开那里 那个他成长起来的地方
Now of course, this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point, is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe.	当然了 这并不意味着我们都应该停止合作-- 恰当的例子呢，是史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克和史蒂夫·乔布斯的著名联手 创建苹果电脑公司-- 但是这并不意味着和独处有重大关系 并且对于一些人来说 这是他们赖以呼吸生存的空气
And in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude.	事实上，几个世纪以来我们已经非常明白 独处的卓越力量
It's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it.	只是到了最近，非常奇怪，我们开始遗忘它了
If you look at most of the world's major religions, you will find seekers -- Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad -- seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community.	如果你看看世界上主要的宗教 你会发现探寻者-- 摩西，耶稣，佛祖，穆罕默德 -- 那些独身去探寻的人们 在大自然的旷野中独处，思索 在那里，他们有了深刻的顿悟和对于奥义的揭示 之后他们把这些思想带回到社会的其他地方去
So no wilderness, no revelations.	没有旷原，没有启示
This is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology.	尽管这并不令人惊讶 如果你注意到现代心理学的思想理论
It turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions.	它反映出来我们甚至不能和一组人待在一起 而不去本能地模仿他们的意见与想法
Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to, you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that's what you're doing.	甚至是看上去私人的，发自内心的事情 像是你被谁所吸引 你会开始模仿你周围的人的信仰 甚至都觉察不到你自己在做什么
And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room, even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas -- I mean zero.	还曾跟随群体的意见 跟随着房间里最具有统治力的，最有领袖气质的人的思路 虽然这真的没什么关系 在成为一个卓越的演讲家还是拥有最好的主意之间-- 我的意思是零相关
So ...	那么...
You might be following the person with the best ideas, but you might not.	你们或许会跟随有最好头脑的人 但是你们也许不会
And do you really want to leave it up to chance?	可你们真的想把这机会扔掉吗？
Much better for everybody to go off by themselves, generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics, and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there.	如果每个人都自己行动或许好得多 发掘他们自己的想法 没有群体动力学的曲解 接着来到一起组成一个团队 在一个良好管理的环境中互相交流 并且在那里学习别的思想
Now if all this is true, then why are we getting it so wrong?	如果说现在这一切都是真的 那么为什么我们还得到这样错误的结论？
Why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces?	为什么我们要这样创立我们的学校，还有我们的工作单位？
And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time?	为什么我们要让这些内向的人觉得那么愧疚 对于他们只是想要离开，一个人独处一段时间的事实？
One answer lies deep in our cultural history.	有一个答案在我们的文化史中埋藏已久
Western societies, and in particular the U.S., have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and "man" of contemplation.	西方社会 特别是在美国 总是偏爱有行动的人 而不是有深刻思考的人 有深刻思考的人
But in America's early days, we lived in what historians call a culture of character, where we still, at that point, valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude.	但是在美国早期的时候 我们生活在一个被历史学家称作性格特征的文化 那时我们仍然，在这点上，判断人们的价值 从人们的内涵和道义正直
And if you look at the self-help books from this era, they all had titles with things like "Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."	而且如果你看一看这个时代关于自立的书籍的话 它们都有这样一种标题： 性格，世界上最伟大的事物
And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming.	并且它们以亚伯拉罕·林肯这样的为标榜 一个被形容为谦虚低调的男人
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him "A man who does not offend by superiority."	拉尔夫·瓦尔多·爱默生称他是 一个以优越二字形容都不为过的人
But then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality.	但是接着我们来到了二十世纪 并且我们融入了一种新的文化 一种被历史学家称作个性的文化
What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business.	所发生的改变就是我们从农业经济发展为 一个大商业经济的世界
And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities.	而且人们突然开始搬迁 从小的城镇搬向城市
And instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives, now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers.	并且一改他们之前的在生活中和所熟识的人们一起工作的方式 现在他们 在一群陌生人中间有必要去证明自己
So, quite understandably, qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important.	这样做是非常可以理解的 像领袖气质和个人魅力这样的品质 突然间似乎变得极为重要
And sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like "How to Win Friends and Influence People."	那么可以肯定的是，自助自立的书的内容变更了以适应这些新的需求 并且它们开始拥有名称 像是《如何赢得朋友和影响他人》（戴尔・卡耐基所著《人性的弱点》）
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen.	他们的特点是做自己的榜样 不得不说确实是好的推销员
So that's the world we're living in today.	所以这就是我们今天生活的世界
That's our cultural inheritance.	这是我们的文化遗产
And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together.	还有我们今天所要面对的问题 像是在科学和经济领域 是如此的巨大和复杂 以至于我们需要人们强有力地团结起来 共同解决这些问题
But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves, the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems.	但是我想说，越给内向者自由让他们做自己 他们就做得越好 去想出他们独特的关于问题的解决办法
So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.	所以现在我很高兴同你们分享 我手提箱中的东西
Guess what?	猜猜是什么？
Books.	书
I have a suitcase full of books.	我有一个手提箱里面装满了书
Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."	这是玛格丽特·阿特伍德的《猫的眼睛》
Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.	这是一本米兰·昆德拉的书
And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed" by Maimonides.	这是一本《迷途指津》 是迈蒙尼德写的
But these are not exactly my books.	但这些实际上都不是我的书
I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors.	我还是带着它们，陪伴着我 因为它们都是我祖父最喜爱的作家所写
My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up, partly because it was filled with his very gentle, very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books.	我的祖父是一名犹太教祭司 他独身一人 在布鲁克林的一间小公寓中居住 那里是我从小到大在这个世界上最喜爱的地方 部分原因是他有着非常温和亲切的，温文尔雅的举止 部分原因是那里充满了书
I mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books.	我的意思是，毫不夸张地说，公寓中的每张桌子，每张椅子 都充分应用着它原有的功能 就是现在作为承载一大堆都在摇曳的书的表面
Just like the rest of my family, my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.	就像我其他的家庭成员一样 我祖父在这个世界上最喜欢做的事情就是阅读
But he also loved his congregation, and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi.	但是他同样也热爱他的宗教 并且你们可以从他的讲述中感觉到他这种爱 这62年来每周他都作为一名犹太教的祭司
He would takes the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.	他会从每周的阅读中汲取养分 并且他会编织这些错综复杂的古代和人文主义的思想的挂毯
And people would come from all over to hear him speak.	并且人们会从各个地方前来 听他的讲话
But here's the thing about my grandfather.	但是有这么一件关于我祖父的事情
Underneath this ceremonial role, he was really modest and really introverted -- so much so that when he delivered these sermons, he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years.	在这个正式的角色下隐藏着 他是一个非常谦虚的非常内向的人 是那么的谦虚内向以至于当他在向人们讲述的时候 他都不敢有视线上的接触 和同样的教堂会众 他已经发言有62年了
And even away from the podium, when you called him to say hello, he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time.	甚至都还远离领奖台 当你们让他说你好的时候 他总会提早结束这对话 担心他会占用你太多的时间
But when he died at the age of 94, the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him.	但是当他94岁去世的时候 警察们需要封锁他所居住的街道邻里 来容纳拥挤的人们 前来哀悼他的人们
And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way.	这些天来我都试着从我祖父的事例中学习 以我自己的方式
So I just published a book about introversion, and it took me about seven years to write.	所以我就出版了一本关于内向性格的书 它花了我7年的时间完成它
And for me, that seven years was like total bliss, because I was reading, I was writing, I was thinking, I was researching.	而对我来说，这七年像是一种极大的喜悦 因为我在阅读，我在写作 我在思考，我在探寻
It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library.	这是我的版本 对于爷爷一天中几个小时都要独自待在图书馆这件事
But now all of a sudden my job is very different, and my job is to be out here talking about it, talking about introversion.	但是现在突然间我的工作变得很不同了 我的工作变成了站在这里讲述它 讲述内向的性格
And that's a lot harder for me, because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now, this is not my natural milieu.	而且这对于我来说是有一点困难的 因为我很荣幸 在现在被你们所有人所倾听 这可不是我自然的文化背景
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could.	所以我准备了一会就像这样 以我所能做到的最好的方式
I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get.	我花了最近一年的时间练习在公共场合发言 在我能得到的每一个机会中
And I call this my "year of speaking dangerously."	我把这一年称作我的危险地发言的一年
And that actually helped a lot.	而且它的确帮了我很大的忙
But I'll tell you, what helps even more is my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude, we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.	但是我要告诉你们一个帮我更大的忙的事情 那就是我的感觉，我的信仰，我的希望 当谈及我们态度的时候 对于内向性格的，对于安静，对于独处的态度时 我们确实是在急剧变化的边缘上保持微妙的平衡
I mean, we are.	我的意思是，我们在保持平衡
And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision.	现在我将要给你们留下一些东西 三件对于你们的行动有帮助的事情 献给那些观看我的演讲的人
Number one: Stop the madness for constant group work.	第一： 停止对于经常要团队协作的执迷与疯狂
Just stop it.	停止它就好了
Thank you.	谢谢你们
And I want to be clear about what I'm saying, because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual, chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know, the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.	我想让我所说的事情变得清晰一些 因为我对于我们的办公深信不疑 应该鼓励它们 那种休闲随意的，聊天似的咖啡厅式的相互作用-- 你们知道的，道不同不相为谋，人们聚到一起 并且互相交换着宝贵的意见
That is great.	这是很棒的
It's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts.	这对于内向者很好，同样对于外向者也好
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work.	但是我们需要更多的隐私和更多的自由 还有更多对于我们本身工作的自主权
School, same thing.	对于学校，也是同样的。
We need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure, but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own.	我们当然需要教会孩子们要一起学习工作 但是我们同样需要教会孩子们怎么样独立完成任务
This is especially important for extroverted children too.	这对于外向的孩子们来说同样是极为重要的
They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part.	他们需要独立完成工作 因为从某种程度上，这是他们深刻思考的来源
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.	好了，第二个：去到野外（打开思维）
Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.	就像佛祖一样，拥有你们自己对于事物的揭示启迪
I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again, but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often.	我并不是说 我们都要跑去小树林里建造我们自己的小屋 并且之后就永远不和别人说话了 但是我要说我们都可以坚持去去除一些障碍物 然后深入我们自己的大脑思想 时不时得再深入一点
Number three: Take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there.	第三点： 好好看一眼你的旅行箱内有什么东西 还有你为什么把它放进去
So extroverts, maybe your suitcases are also full of books.	所以外向者们 也许你们的箱子内同样堆满了书
Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment.	或者它们装满了香槟的玻璃酒杯 或者是跳伞运动的设备
Whatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy.	不管它是什么，我希望每当你们有机会你们就把它拿出来 用你的能量和你的快乐让我们感受到美和享受
But introverts, you being you, you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase.	但是内向者们，你们作为内向者 你们很可能有仔细保护一切的冲动 在你箱子里的东西
And that's okay.	这没有问题
But occasionally, just occasionally, I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see, because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry.	但是偶尔地，只是说偶尔地 我希望你们可以打开你们的手提箱，让别人看一看 因为这个世界需要你们，同样需要你们身上所携带的你们特有的事物
So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly.	所以对于你们即将走上的所有旅程，我都给予你们我最美好的祝愿 还有温柔地说话的勇气
Thank you very much.	非常感谢你们
Thank you.	谢谢。
Thank you.	谢谢
Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house, I remember these Turkish carpets, and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.	还是小孩时，在家里爬来爬去， 我记得这些土耳其地毯， 还有这些景象：打斗的景象、恩爱的景象。
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier.	你看，这只动物试图对抗 士兵刺下的矛。
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week, of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.	我妈上星期拍这些照片， 这些地毯，到现在我都还记得。
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity -- pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.	还有另一个物品，这个高耸的家具， 有动物、怪兽和裸女 – 对小孩而言蛮可怕的。
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories, so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.	今天我记得的是，这些物品都会说故事， 因此说故事对我的工作有很强的影响。
And then there was another influence.	另外还有一个影响。
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers, we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.	我还是个青少年，15、16岁，像其他青少年一样， 想做自己喜爱、自己信仰的事。
And so, I fused together the two things I loved the most, which was skiing and windsurfing.	因此， 我融合了我最喜欢的两件事： 滑雪和风帆。
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.	那是避开瑞士枯燥气候的好方法。
So, I created this compilation of the two: I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there, and some foot straps, and some metal fins, and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.	因此，我创作了这两件事的组合： 我拿了我的雪橇及滑溜板，安上一个桅杆座， 几条绑脚带及一些金属鳍片， 就这样，在结冰的湖面高速滑行。
It was really a death trap.	那真是个死亡陷阱。
I mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.	很难相信， 它可以用，但却非常危险。
And I realized then I had to go to design school.	因此，我知道我该去读设计学校。
I mean, look at those graphics there.	我是说，看看那些图像。
So, I went to design school, and it was the early '90s when I finished.	因此我去读了设计学校， 那是 90年代早期，当我毕业时，
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley, so I wanted to be there, and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes, that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.	我发现硅谷发生着奇特的事， 我想要去那里， 我发现计算机正在走入家庭。 计算机要改变才能和我们在家里相处。
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, "Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."	我找到一份工作，在设计顾问公司上班， 我们会去参加会议， 经理们进来， 他们会说： 我们要做的事，真的很重要。
And they would give the projects code names, you know, mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.	他们将为项目取个代码， 大都取自星际大战，如：C3PO、尤达、路克。
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand, and I would ask questions.	充满期待，我这个年轻设计师 坐在会议室后方，我会举手 问问题。
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions, but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"	回想当初，或许是些笨问题， 像：Cap Lock 键 做什么用?
or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?	或 Num Lock 键 做什么用?
Do they need it?	他们需要它吗？
Do they want it in their homes?"	在家里要它吗？
What I realized then is, they didn't really want to change the legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.	那时我觉得，他们不想改变 传统的东西；他们不想改变内部。
They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins, to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.	他们要设计师去创造表皮， 放些好看的东西在盒子外。
And I didn't want to be a colorist.	我不想当彩妆师。
It wasn't what I wanted to do.	那不是我想做的。
I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.	我不想做这样的美容师。
And then I saw this quote: "advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."	接着我读到这句名言： 广告是公司为没有原创性，而付出的代价。
So, I had to start on my own.	因此，我必须自己来。
So I moved to San Francisco, and I started a little company, fuseproject.	我搬到旧金山， 开了家小公司：Fuseproject。
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.	我想做的是重要的事。
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.	我不要只是做表皮， 我要做完整的人类体验。
And so the first projects were sort of humble, but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way, and maybe finding some new functionality.	早期的专案都很卑微， 它们采用科技，放到产品里， 让人得以新方式去使用， 或找到新功能性。
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company, right when it launched, and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical.	这个表是我们为迷你库伯汽车公司 开张时做的， 它的显示是第一个可以 水平、垂直调换。
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here, without bending my elbow.	它让我能准确读取时间， 不必弯曲手臂。
And other projects, which were really about transformation, about matching the human need.	其他的项目则是做转换， 去满足人类的需求。
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer, and it ships completely flat, and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.	这是为意大利公司做的小家具， 装运时是平的， 然后可折成咖啡桌、凳子、或什么的。
And something a little bit more experimental: this is a light fixture for Swarovski, and what it does is, it changes shape.	还有一些实验性的： 这是施华洛灯具， 它会改变形状：
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.	圆形、环形、方形、8 字形，
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.	在小型计算机数字板上画一下， 灯具就调整为你要的形状。
And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.	最后，赫曼米勒的叶子灯。
This is a pretty involved process; it took us about four and a half years.	这是个介入很深的过程， 它花了我们大约四年半。
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light, a new experience of light.	我一心追求创造独特的照明体验， 新的照明体验。
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.	因此我们要同时设计灯和灯泡。
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.	我认为，这是很特别的设计机会。
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light.	我追求的新体验 是让使用者选择从 一种温暖的，有点微弱的心情灯光， 一路到光亮的工作灯。
So, the light bulb actually does that.	灯泡真的可以那样。
It allows the person to switch, and to mix these two colorations.	使用者可以调整、 混合这两种色调。
And it's done in a very simple way: one just touches the base of the light, and on one side, you can mix the brightness, and on the other, the coloration of the light.	原理很简单： 只要碰触灯座， 一边可以混合亮度， 另一边则是光的色调。
So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.	因此这些项目都有人道意义， 我认为，身为设计师，我们该思考 如何创造我们的作品 和世界的新关系， 不论是商业项目， 或如我将要提的公益专案。
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business, value to the users also, but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value.	因为大家都同意，身为设计师我们带来价值： 商业价值、使用者价值， 但我认为，是我们放进项目的价值 最后创造出更大的价值。
And the values we bring can be about environmental issues, about sustainability, about lower power consumption.	我们带来的价值 可能是关于环境议题、 永续性、低耗能。
You know, they can be about function and beauty; they can be about business strategy.	它们可能是功能或美观； 可能是商业策略。
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together.	但设计师却是黏胶 把这些组合在一起。
So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with, and it has a humanistic technology.	颚骨耳机 是你们知道的项目， 它使用人性化的科技。
It feels your skin. It rests on your skin, and it knows when it is you're talking.	它能感觉你的皮肤， 它知道你何时说话。
And by knowing when it is you're talking, it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about, which is the environmental noises.	因为知道你说话， 它可以消除其他噪音， 也就是环境噪音。
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can.	颚骨 的其他人性面是， 我们决定要除去太科技的东西、 及难懂的东西， 并使它尽可能美观。
I mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.	就是说，你想： 我们用心选择太阳眼镜、珠宝、 或饰品等是很重要的， 如果它不好看，就不该挂在脸上。
And this is what we're pursuing here.	这就是我们追求的。
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.	但我们如何创造 颚骨，真的很特别。
I want to point at something here, on the left.	我要用左边的画面来说明。
This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work.	这是电路板，是放在内部 使科技运作的东西。
But this is the design process: there's somebody changing the board, putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs, as the designers on the other side are doing the work.	设计过程是这样的： 有人改变电路板、 在电路板放描迹器、改变IC的位置， 而设计师在另一边工作。
So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.	所以它不再是为科技做表皮。
It's really about designing from the inside out.	而真的是由内而外的设计。
And then, on the other side of the room, the designers are making small adjustments, sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.	而房间的另一边 设计师们忙着做修正、 画草图、徒手画、放进计算机等，
And it's what I call being design driven.	这就是我说的 设计驱导。
You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out.	你知道的，有些推力和拉力， 但设计真的由内往外 帮助定义整个体验。
And then, of course, design is never done.	当然设计永远做不完。
And this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff.	这也是我们工作的独特之处， 因为它永远做不完， 你必得做其他的东西。
The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue to really touch the user, in many ways.	包装、网站，你必需继续 以各种方式接触使用者。
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?	但你如何留住人，如果它永远做不完呢？
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone, you know, really understands that you need a different structure.	赫扎因拉赫曼 – 颚骨 执行长 很清楚需要有不同的结构。
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners, it's a partnership.	所谓不同结构是指我们是伙伴， 有伙伴关系。
We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project, and then we also share in the rewards.	我们可以继续工作， 致力于这个专案， 我们都分享成果。
And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.	这是另一个项目，另一个伙伴型的方法。
This is called Y Water, and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt, Austrian originally, who came to us, and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink, or an organic drink for his kids, to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he's trying to get them away from.	这个叫Y水， 是由来自洛杉矶的家伙，叫 托马斯阿恩特， 出生于澳洲，他来找我们， 想要为小孩们创造健康饮水， 或叫有机饮水， 以替代高糖含量的汽水， 他要小孩别喝汽水。
So, we worked on this bottle, and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.	因此，我们创造了这个瓶子， 它在各个面向都是对称的。
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.	这使瓶子可以变成游戏。
The bottles connect together, and you can create different shapes, different forms.	瓶子可互相结合， 可创造不同形状、不同形态。
Thank you.	谢谢。
And then while we were doing this, the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y, and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not," are probably the most important words that kids ask.	当我们正在做这个时， 瓶子颠倒的形状让我们想到Y， 于是我们想到 why、why not 可能是孩子们最重要的疑问词。
So we called it Y Water.	于是我们把它命名为 Y水。
And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room: the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding, it all becomes deeply connected.	这又是 另个出自同一房间的例子： 立体设计、构想、品牌， 都有很深的结合。
And then the other thing about this project is, we bring intellectual property, we bring a marketing approach, we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day, what we bring is these values, and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.	这个专案的另一件事是， 我们带来知识产权， 我们带来营销手法， 我们带来这些，到当天结束时， 我们带来这些价值， 这些价值替公司创造一个灵魂。
And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor, when others can be creative and do more with it.	那个报偿是特别高的，如果你的设计工作 是个有创意的付出， 使其他人能有创意并做得更好。
Here's another project, which I think really emulates that.	这是另一个专案， 它发挥了那个理念。
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.	这是 每个学童有计算机，或叫 百元计算机 专案。
This picture is incredible.	这张照片令人惊奇。
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.	奈及利亚人把最贵重的东西带在头上。
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.	这个女孩顶着计算机去上学。
I mean, to me, it just means so much.	对我，那真是意义不凡。
But when Nicholas Negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot, he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us about two and a half years ago, there were some clear ideas.	当 尼古拉斯尼葛洛庞帝 – 他谈过很多这个专案的事， 他是 OLPC 的创始人 – 来找我们 大约两年半前， 他有很清晰的想法。
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology, and those are pillars of his life, but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.	他要推动教育，他要推动科技， 这是他生命的支柱， 也是 每个学童有计算机 使命的支柱。
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.	但他谈的第三支柱是设计。
And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.	那时我并不设计计算机。
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.	我不很想做，因为有之前的经历。
But what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust.	但他说得很有意思， 设计可以使这些学童 喜欢这个计算机。 如何使它便宜、强固，
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key -- -- and the Num Lock key, too.	此外他说，他要除去 Cap Lock 键 – – 还有 Num Lock 键 。
So, I was convinced.	我被说服了。
We designed it to be iconic, to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.	我们把它设计得佷独特， 看起来不同，就像学童用的，但不像玩具。
And then the integration of all these great technologies, which you've heard about, the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect; the screen, which you can read in sunlight; the keyboard, which is made out of rubber, and it's protected from the environment.	还有那些重要科技的整合， 你听过的，如： WiFi 天线让学童们上网； 阳光下也能读的屏幕； 橡胶做的键盘， 它不受环境影响。
You know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers.	这些重要科技之能加进去， 全是靠一股热情、 OLPC 推动者、及工程师们。
They fought the suppliers, they fought the manufacturers.	他们向供货商争取， 向制造商争取。
I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is.	他们就像动物一样， 为了留住这些而争取。
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea.	因为这样，而能达成这个项目， 容许整个过程 不致扼杀原本的想法。
And I think this is something really important.	我认为这是很重要的事。
So, now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers, and in Mongolia.	所以，看看这些照片 – 早晨起来，你看到奈及利亚的学童、 乌拉圭的学童 有计算机了，还有蒙古的学童。
And we went away from obviously the beige.	我们不再用米黄色 –
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.	而用活泼的色彩；有趣。
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.	事实上，你可以看到，每个标志都有点不同。
It's because we were able to run, during the manufacturing process, 20 colors for the X and the O, which is the name of the computer, and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor, you get 20 times 20: you get 400 different options there.	因为我们能够 在制造过程中， 各 20 色用在X和O， 这是计算机的名字， 将它们在制造现场混合， 20 x 20： 共有 400 种组合。
So, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible.	看开发中国家学童用它们 得到的启示是难能可贵的。
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and I had to take it back. It was hard.	但这是我侄子安东尼，在瑞士， 有个下午我让他用计算机， 要把它拿回来，还真难。
And it was a prototype.	这是原型机。
And a month and a half later, I come back to Switzerland, and there he is playing with his own version.	一个半月后， 我回到瑞士， 看到他在玩自己的计算机。
Like paper, paper and cardboard.	像是纸，纸和纸板。
So, I'm going to finish with one last project, and this is a little bit more of adult play.	结束前将再谈一个项目。 这有点像是成人游戏。
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.	或许有人听过纽约安全套。
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago.	它才刚发行，在情人节公开， 二月十四日，大约十天前。
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us, and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.	纽约卫生局来找我们， 他们要找分送安全套的方法 免费分送 3,600 万个安全套给纽约市民。
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.	是一件大工程，我们设计配送器，
These are the dispensers.	这些就是配送器。
There's this friendly shape.	它有亲切的外形。
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant, and it has to be easily serviceable: you have to know where it is and what it does.	有点像是设计消防栓， 它要方便好用： 我们要知道它在哪、能做什么。
And we also designed the condoms themselves.	我们也设计安全套本身。
And I was just in New York at the launch, and I went to see all these places where they're installed: this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store; at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.	发行时我刚好在纽约， 我去看它们装设的地方。 这是 Puerto Rican，一家小型杂货店， 克里斯多街的一家酒吧、在撞球场。
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.	装在各处的游民保健中心。
Of course, clubs and discos, too.	当然还有俱乐部和迪斯科舞厅。
And here's the public service announcement for this project.	这是项目的公共广告。
Get some.	拿几个吧。
So, this is really where design is able to create a conversation.	这是设计 能创造的对话。
I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them.	我到了这些地方，人们都 都去拿了。
They were excited.	他们很兴奋。
It was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and I think that's also what design can do.	可以说破冰了， 它打破了难为情， 我认为这也是设计能做到的。
So, I was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot, but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.	因此，我想要... 丢一些安全套给观众， 但我不确定是否适宜。
Yeah? All right, all right.	啊，很好。
I have only a few.	我只有一些。
So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.	还有一些，想要可以再找我。
And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom, you can just say you like the design.	如果有人问：你为何带安全套， 你可以说，你喜欢它的设计。
So, I'll finish with just one thought: if we all work together on creating value, but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do, I think we can change the work that we do.	最后，我以一个想法来做结束： 如果我们一起创造价值， 如果我们都记住我们工作的价值， 我们能改变我们的工作。
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with, and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.	我们能改变这些价值，能改变公司， 最后，也许我们能一起改变世界。
So, thank you.	谢谢。
Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.	这里我要感谢 TED 大会主办方，特别感谢克里斯和安弥
I cannot believe I'm here.	我真不曾想象到我会有机会登上这个舞台
I have not slept in weeks.	我有好几周都没睡好觉了。
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous -- and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized.	刚才我在台下还跟尼尔比谁睡得更少呢 为了准备这个演讲 我可谓从没有这么紧张过 我刚刚意识到我一紧张就会这样子搓手
So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things.	好了，我今天主要是谈谈我们这个组织做的一些事情 它的名字是826瓦伦西亚 希望大家听完我的演讲后能有所启发，一起干类似的事情
Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn, I was trying to finish my first book, I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.	2000年的时候，我住在布鲁克林 那时我正在写我的第一本书 每天白天，我都会在街上神智恍惚的来回走 因为我每晚都是从夜里12点写到凌晨5点
Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.	此外，我自小就是在一种教师的氛围中成长的
My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching.	我母亲是一位教师，我姐姐毕业后也当上了一名教师 我有很多朋友在念完大学以后也走上了教师的岗位
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were, and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew.	我经常听他们谈论学校里的事情 他们说学校里有很多给人鼓舞的事情在发生 我认为教师是最勤劳 同时又经常能给人们带来启迪的人之一
But I knew so many of the things they were up against, so many of the struggles they were dealing with.	此外，我也深知他们面临哪些困难 知道他们的种种艰难处境
And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level, in their reading and writing in particular.	他们遇到的其中一个难题是 让孩子在读写这两方面 的成绩得到提升 这个问题在那些市立学校里头表现最突出
Now, so many of these students had come from households where English isn't spoken in the home, where a lot of them have different special needs, learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded.	那些学校的学生 在家里根本不说英语 此外 他们还有其他各种不同的需要 包括学习障碍 而他们所在的学校 则经常遇到资金不足的难题
And so they would talk to me about this and say, "You know, what we really need is just more people, more bodies, more one-on-one attention, more hours, more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."	我的朋友跟我提起这事 他们说：我们要的是更多的人手 对孩子给予更多一对一的关心 要是我们能找到更多人，更多有经验的人 让他们一对一的给孩子进行辅导，那就好了
Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?"	我就问：那你们干嘛不给孩子来个一对一的辅导？
And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.	他们回答说 我们每个人都要负责五个班，每个班三四十人
This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.	加起来我们每人每天都要应付180到200个学生
How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"	我们怎么有可能给予学生 哪怕是每人一小时的关注？
You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.	除非你大幅度加大教师的工作量，并克隆出更多的老师
And so we started talking about this.	于是我们开始考虑这事情
And at the same time, I thought about this massive group of people I knew: writers, editors, journalists, graduate students, assistant professors, you name it.	与此同时 我想到了我认识的那一班专业人士 他们是作家、或编辑、或记者、或研究生 或者教授助理，反正就是搞文字的
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word -- I hope to have an interest in the English language, but I'm not speaking it well right now.	这些人的工作时间都很灵活 他们也对英语这门语言怀有浓厚兴趣 此刻，我也想讲得更有条理 但我显然是言不由衷了
I'm trying.	我尽可能讲得好一点吧。
That clock has got me.	看 墙上那个钟告诉我要控制好时间！
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.	我认识的每个人都认同文字创作不可替代的意义 民主的孕育、优质生活的形成，皆舍此不可
And so they had, you know, their time and their interest, but at the same time there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together.	而我的这些朋友 他们有的是时间和兴趣 但是，我们那时候还没有一种管道， 把这两种需求结合起来
So when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.	其后我们搬回到旧金山，租了这所房子
And the idea was to put McSweeney's -- McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year, and a few other magazines -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time.	我们想把《麦思维尼季刊》 那是一份每年出版两三次的刊物 以及其他杂志，都放到那里 我们第一次要搬进办公室啦
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway, why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school, get extra help on their written homework, so you have basically no border between these two communities?"	我们那时候想：这里每天都会有那么多的作家、编辑、记者 进出这个办公室 为什么我们不把房子的大门打开 让附近的孩子在放学后来得这里 获得专家的课业辅导 以此来拉近两个作家与孩子两个群体间的距离？
So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on, at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing, or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.	我们就想 我们只管在办公室干自己的事 下午两点半孩子一放学，你就放下手头的工作 或者你找别的时间去干，或者你干晚一点
You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood.	反正在下午 你就把时间献给这些住在附近的孩子
So, we had this place, we rented it, the landlord was all for it.	于是我们找到这房子，租了下来 房东对此也十分支持。
We did this mural, that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history of the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.	看，那是一副壁画 它以壁画的方式 来讲述印刷术的故事 你要花点时间，走到大街上，远远的看，才能看得出其中的含义
So we rented this space.	好了，我们就租下了这房子
And everything was great except the landlord said, "Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.	一切都很顺利，可是房东跟我们说 这个区域是专门用作销售的
Really!"	单单搞一个辅导中心是不够的！
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell, but we did all the necessary research.	那时候我们真的想不到有什么东西值得卖的， 但我们做了充分的研究
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below, acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.	发现那里原来是一个健身室，地板都是铺橡胶的， 还有隔音的天花板和荧光灯。
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors, whitewashed beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place, somebody said, "You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."	当我们把这些东西都拆下来以后，我们发现地面是木板做的。 还能看到粉刷成白色的边， 就在我们给那房子进行翻新的时候，有人喊出一句： 大家看，这是不是很像一艘船的内核？
And we looked around and somebody else said, "Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer."	
And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh, and we said, "There's a point to that.	于是我们仔细的环顾四周，又有人说， 嘿，不如我们就在此地卖海盗用品吧！
This is the pirate supply store.	说干就干。正因为这样做能够给人们带来一点笑料 我们不认为那是纯粹的疯子的行为
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.	就这么决定了要卖海盗用品
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see, we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.	看，这时我在一块手绢上画的一幅画
We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.	还有手工制作的海盗假腿
Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display, which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night -- special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.	在顶上你还能看到海盗必备的眼罩 那个黑色框里装的是日间使用的眼罩 而素色和其他颜色的眼罩 通常是在夜间 一些特殊场合使用
So we opened this place.	于是我们装修完以后就开张了。
And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in.	看，这是一个大盆子 我们把一些小礼物放到里面去，孩子来了，就去那里找礼物。
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.	这是一个假眼——假如你眼睛坏了，可以用这个。
These are some signs that we have all over the place: "Practical Joking with Pirates."	还有这些贴在墙壁上的口号： 与海盗开玩笑。
While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head.	就在你细读这些口号的时候，我们就在背后拉一下绳子 就马上会有八个拖把头降临到你的头上
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.	那纯粹是我个人的发明，因为我说，总得要有东西摔到人们的头上啊，
It became mop heads.	这东西就是拖把头。
And this is the fish theater, which is just a saltwater tank with three seats, and then right behind it we set up this space, which was the tutoring center.	这个是鱼缸戏院， 其实就是有一个金鱼缸，前面摆三张凳子， 就在那后面就是 我们的辅导中心
So right there is the tutoring center, and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices, where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.	镜头上看到的就是我们的辅导中心， 背后则是麦思维尼的办公室 我们就在那里做书刊的编辑工作
The kids would come in -- or we thought they would come in. I should back up.	孩子们会来到这里 ——或者该这么说：当初我们确实是认为孩子会来到我们那里的
We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months renovating this place.	现在空间都开放了 我们可是花了几个月时间来翻新这地方啊
We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.	那里有书、桌椅和其他的工具
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.	我在怕罗奥托市的一家假日酒店通过网上拍卖 买来了11台G4苹果电脑，以及其他的东西。
Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.	不管怎么说，反正我们是把一切都准备好了 我们就开始等
It was started with about 12 of my friends, people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.	一开始我联系到了十二位朋友， 他们都住在附近，并且跟我已认识很久。
And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free."	我们坐在办公室等，到了下午两点半 我们把一块牌放在门口的过道上， 上面写着：免费提供英语及写作辅导—— 一切免费，欢迎光临。
And they didn't.	开始时我们想：孩子们一定会飞奔到这里来的 他们一定会喜欢这地方。可是，我们看不到有孩子过来
And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.	我们坐在桌边等啊等，就是看不到孩子的影子
And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.	我们都感到非常沮丧 我们一连等了好多个星期，就是等不到一个孩子
And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap, because we were operating behind a pirate supply store.	这时候，有人提醒我们说 也许是因为信任的问题 毕竟我们是一个卖海盗用品的店铺啊
We never put it together, you know?	这一点我们倒是没有想到
And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari, a longtime San Francisco educator -- she was teaching in Mexico City, she had all the experience necessary, knew everything about education, was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood -- I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.	于是，我找到了妮涅娃·卡里咖丽 她在旧金山当过老师 后来到了新墨西哥洲去教书了 她经验十足 懂得教育的门道 跟我们那个社区的老师和社会名流也很熟 我劝她搬回旧金山
She took over as executive director.	让她担任整个项目的执行主任
Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything, and so suddenly it was actually full every day.	很快的，她就跟当地的老师 家长、学生以及相关人士做好了思想工作 后来我们的辅导中心就变得天天都人满为患了
And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention.	我们每天都努力为学生提供 一对一的辅导
The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.	我们务求做到给予每一位学生一对一的关注
You know, it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention, a student can get one grade level higher.	因为，研究表明一年当中 假如能够给予学生35－40个小时的一对一辅导 学生的学习成绩会跃升一个层次
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.	来到这里的孩子，他们在家里大多不说英语
They come there, many times their parents -- you can't see it, but there's a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there -- the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.	他们的家长有时也会随着他们一同到来 也许你在画面上看不到，但是我们准备了一张长椅子 那是我在伯克莱的一次拍卖会上买下来的 家长们有时会来看自己的孩子
If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m., 2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often, by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space, which is very strange, because it's school, in a way.	假如你是住在瓦伦西亚街附近的话，每到下午2：30 要是你到街上走 你会迎头撞上背着书包向着辅导中心跑的孩子 这看起来有点不正常，因为那里已经变成半个学校了
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different.	因为去那里已经变成一种情感上的需要 这就是我们的辅导中心的独特之处
And the other thing was, there was no stigma.	另外，去辅导中心不会带有任何的羞辱成分
Kids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help," or something like that.	因为孩子们不是去上差等生补习班 或者是诸如此类的机构。
It was 826 Valencia.	那里只有一个名字：826瓦伦西亚
First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.	首先，那里是一家卖海盗用品的店，这一点就够呛了
And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.	此外，我们在房间的后面还有一个出版机构
And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often, and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.	所以说，我们的实习生经常也是 坐在同样一张桌子边 他们的旁边就是参加辅导的孩子
And so it became a tutoring center -- publishing center, is what we called it -- and a writing center.	所以说，那里不仅仅是辅导中心 出版中心 还是一个写作中心
They go in, and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids, too.	他们来到这里以后也许是和高中生一起 完成一部小说——我们有天赋过人的孩子
So there's no stigma.	根本不会有羞辱的存在
They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.	大家坐在一起，那是一种充满创意的环境
They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.	孩子们看着身边的大人，也要学习学习
These adults, they're working in their field.	而这些大人，虽然他们也在忙着自己的事情
They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other.	孩子们可以把头探过来，问大人问题 这样一来，相互都可以在交流中提炼出价值
There's a lot of cross-pollination.	大人和孩子之间是可以相互感染的。
The only problem, especially for the adults working at McSweeney's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up, was that there was just the one bathroom.	但是 我们也遇到了一个令我们头痛的问题 特别是对于麦思维尼出版机构的员工来说，更是如此 因为他们当初来到这里时并没有想到会遇到今日之种种。 我们那地方只有一个洗手间
With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.	而我们每天都会迎来六十多名学生，这真是一个难题
But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention -- they go home, they're finished. They don't stall.	但是，当你看到孩子们完成功课 每一天都能受到大人们的悉心指导 回到家后，已经不需为功课而烦恼
They don't do their homework in front of the TV.	不需坐在电视机前面写作业
They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family, enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.	每天下午五点半就可以回家，跟家人共度美好时光 做自己爱干的事情，或者是到外面去玩
And that makes a happy family.	这样一来我们不就有一个和谐的家庭了吗？
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.	社区里的和谐家庭多了，社区不也更和睦吗？
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.	只要这样的和睦社区越来越多，我们不是有希望看到一个和平的都市以及和平的世界吗？
So the key to it all is homework!	所以说，一切的关键在于让孩子完成作业！
There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention.	还有，一对一的专注辅导
So we started off with about 12 volunteers, and then we had about 50, and then a couple hundred.	我们一开始有12名志愿者 后来有50人 再后来就增加到了几百人
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.	现在，有1400个志愿者加入了我们
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.	我们力求让志愿者的参与变得非常简单
The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month, those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder, next to one student, concentrated attention, shining this beam of light on their work, on their thoughts and their self-expression, is going to be absolutely transformative, because so many of the students have not had that ever before.	最重要一点是，哪怕你每个月才能挤出两个小时的空余时间 那用来做一对一辅导已经足够 你就坐在孩子的旁边 给孩子以指点 让孩子在思想上和表达上变得更优秀 这样的片刻对于孩子而言是具有洗心革面之意义的 因为很多孩子从来都没有过这样的体验
So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months, it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."	所以我们说，即便你每半年只有两小时的空余时间 也不要紧，那已经足够了。
So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.	也正是因为这样的安排，我们的志愿者队伍增长很快
Then we said, "Well, what are we going to do with the space during the day, because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"	后来我们想， 白天的时间是不是也把辅导中心利用起来 是不是在下午两点半孩子放学之前也把这地方用起来
So we started bringing in classes during the day.	所以我们决定要在日间开课
So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book -- you can see it being typed up above.	每天，都会有孩子来到这里做实习，在大人的指导下写书 你可以看到屏幕上显示的就是他们写的书
This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.	这是其中一个班，他们还真的为写作而疯狂呢
You just point a camera at a class, and it always looks like this.	不管什么时候，你拿着一台摄像机对着孩子，总会见到这样的表情 并且这样的表情长期如此
So this is one of the books that they do.	这是他们做成的一本书
Notice the title of the book, "The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic."	大家注意看那书名 《从未被借出的一本书：泰坦尼克》
And the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic."	书的第一句话是这样的：从前，有一本书，书名叫《辛迪》 写的是泰坦尼克的故事
So, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up, taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.	此外，我们还有大人坐在后面把这些文字敲到电脑里 一切都十分认真，简直是把孩子乐坏了
So then we still had more tutors to use.	不过，我们的志愿者人数还是很多
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.	这是某次活动上的照片
The teachers that we work with -- and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.	我们跟老师紧密合作 老师们知道该怎么做
So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?	有一次，他们问：你们是不是也把志愿者派到学校里去啊？
Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you, necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in, or aren't close enough?"	因为总会有一些孩子没办法来你们这里啊 比如说，有些家长自己不甚积极 或者是孩子家住得比较远？
So then we started saying, "Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.	 于是我们想，我们有1400多位志愿者
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say, "I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.	假如有老师跟我们联系说 接下来的五个星期我的课堂需要12名志愿者
We're working on our college essays.	因为我们要准备大学入学申请的论文。你们把志愿者叫过来吧
Send them in."	只要是有空闲的都可以报名。他们只需在课前半个钟到课室就行了
So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.	老师会告诉他们该做些什么 如何做：课堂内容是什么，要达到什么教学目的
Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.	志愿者在老师的指导之下开展辅导 他们到一个大课室
The teacher tells them what to do, how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.	这现已成为我们做得最大的一件事 志愿者直接由家里、公司来到学校 直接走进课堂 跟学生一起工作
They work under the teacher's guide, and it's all in one big room.	通过这样的方式，我们能够接触到更多的学生
And that's actually the brunt of what we do is, people going straight from their workplace, straight from home, straight into the classroom and working directly with the students.	接着又有一所学校跟我们说，我们腾出一间教室给你们用怎么样？
This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News," that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages -- English and Spanish.	这是他们做的报纸，叫《有话直说》 上面有来自市长纽绅的专栏 并且是以英语西班牙语双语写的
So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said, "Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?	有一天我们收到伊丝贝拉的信， 她说，你们怎么不给孩子们布置一个写书的任务啊？
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."	我希望看到孩子是怎么想象一个和平的世界的
And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School, which is a school that we had worked with on some other things, and we gave that assignment to the students.	于是我们来到图耳鼓·马绍尔高中 我们曾经和那个高中有过合作 我们向学生布置了这个作业
And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.	我们对孩子说，你们写的每一个字，伊丝贝拉都会去阅读
She's going to publish them in a book.	她会把你们的文章做成一本书
She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.	她还会资助你们出版
It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."	你们的书将会在旧金山一带的书店上买得到 或者是通过亚马逊在线书店，在全球任何一个角落都能购买
So these kids worked harder than they've ever worked on anything in their lives, because there was that outside audience, there was Isabel Allende on the other end.	于是孩子们干的很用劲 他们之前干任何事情都没有这么认真 因为他们知道有一个潜在的读者 还有伊丝贝拉
I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well.	我记得我们一共有170位志愿者参与了这个项目 这个项目运行非常顺利
We had a big party at the end.	最后我们还开了一个庆功会
This is a book that you can find anywhere.	现在你在很多地方都能找到这书了。
So that led to a series of these.	由此也开启了一系列的项目
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one, "I Might Get Somewhere."	谭恩美就表示要支持下一本书的出版 那书叫《也许我能到达某地》
And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.	于是这成为了一个长期的项目，我们也出了很多书
Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing.	甚至是变得有点出书成瘾了
The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life if they know it's going to be permanent, know it's going to be on a shelf, know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said, that we've honored their words, honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts -- all this attention that we give to their thoughts.	孩子们为了出书也会做得非常认真 因为他们知道那将会成为一种具有长久意义的东西。 知道他们写的书会出现在书架上 他们所想所写的东西没有人能够磨灭 我们尊重他们的表达以及他们的思想 他们花了几百个小时进行创作 前后改了五六遍 我们一直都在支持孩子们去表达自己的想法
And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level, they can never go back.	而一旦他们的写作能力达到了一定的水平 通常就不会下降了
It's absolutely transformative.	这样的辅导对于孩子而言具有洗心革面的意义
And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.	孩子的书摆在店卖 就放在木板旁边
We sell all the student books.	这些书全都卖光了
Where else would you put them, right?	你还能想象把这些书放在别的地方吗
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening with the stores. The store, actually -- even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money.	我们把书都卖了 可是发生了奇怪的事情 就是我们这个辅导中心旁边的这店 虽然我们一开始的时候开这店只是为了好玩
So it was paying the rent.	但现在它居然也给我们带来利润了 我们就用这个来付房租
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing -- I don't know, I don't want to judge.	也许这是只有在旧金山才会发生的怪事吧 我也不知道 也不想评论
But people would come in -- and this was before the pirate movies and everything!	但人们确实是会来到这里 并且那时候《加勒比海盗》还没有上映呢
It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money, but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.	就因为如此 这店给我们带来了许多收益 我们拿那些钱交租 也给这里的一位全职员工发工资
There's the ocean maps you can see on the left.	左边那个是海洋地图
And it became a gateway to the community.	这里就成为了社区的一个窗口
People would come in and say, "What the --?	人们经常进来问
What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web.	这里是搞 xx 什么的啊 这里我不说那个字了
Is that a rule? I don't know.	这是常规吗 我也不清楚
They would say, "What is this?"	他们会问 这是什么？
And people would come in and learn more about it.	进来的人们都会学到一些东西
And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there -- right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.	而就在店的旁边 他们就会看到孩子正在上课
This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping, and they might be more likely to buy some lard, or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook, or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.	正好有个写作班正在上课 他们就在这里买东西 他们更多的是买一些喂鸟的食物 也有买钩子的 还有买钩子保护器的 反正就是我们这里的古怪的东西
So the store actually did really well.	我们可以说 这店办得还挺好的
But it brought in so many people -- teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody -- because it was street level. It was open to the public.	可是来的人太多了 教师、慈善人士、志愿者 什么人都有 因为那正好就在街角 并且是对外开放的
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.	而不是像一些公益组织那样 隐藏在市中心30层高的大楼深处 它就在社区里 就是给社区提供服务的 并且时刻都向社区开放
So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.	这时候 奇怪的事情又发生了
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said, "Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"	我过去在布鲁克林认识的那些朋友 他们也想搞个这样的辅导机构
And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators, so they combined with a lot of local designers, local writers, and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing.	并且他们很多以前就是当教师的 或者是马上就要成为教师的 于是他们联合当地的一些设计师 教师 所有的点子都是他们自己想的 一切都是他们自己亲力亲为
They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.	不过他们不想卖海盗用品
They didn't think that that was going to work there.	因为那边没有这个需求
So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York, they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.	但是他们想到了纽约市经常搞反暴力活动 于是就开设了布鲁克林超级英雄专卖店
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.	这是山姆·博茨设计的
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith's shops that has to have every service they've ever offered, you know, all over there.	他特意设计成这个模样 就是仿照五金店 让人感觉里面应有尽有 想买什么都能找到
So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.	于是这店开张了 里面有如一家百货公司 各种简单的英雄装备都有
These are all handmade.	并且是手工制作的
These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.	大多是废物利用
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.	而所有的包装都是出自山姆·博茨的手
So then you have the villain containment unit, where kids put their parents. You have the office.	还有这个困兽笼子 孩子们把自己的父母丢到里面去 还有办公室
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there, it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism, which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.	还有这里 你把商品交给店员 商品就随着升降机上升 柜台后面那个店员就会告诉你 要作一番英雄宣誓 凡是要买东西的 都必须宣誓 这个也多少影响了他们的收入
Personally, I think it's a problem.	我个人以为那是一个问题
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.	毕竟他们做这些商品花了不少心机
These are some of the products. These are all handmade.	看这些就是他们的商品 都是手工制作的
This is a secret identity kit.	这是秘密身份认证卡片
If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone, one American female marketing executive from Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.	假如你想充当Sharon Boone 她是来自于新泽西州霍伯昆的营销经理 这里一整个箱子都是 关于 Sharon Boone的东西
So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape, and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action.	这个是披肩的外披 穿上以后 你踏上这个三层的台阶 我们就拧开风扇开关 看 那披肩神起来了
There's nothing worse than, you know, getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.	不过也许披肩会鼓起来 那就最不如意了
So then, the secret door -- this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in, but it slowly opens.	还有这个秘密门 你刚进来的时候不会看到的 但是进来后你会慢慢发现
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.	在一大堆钩子中间 你会发现这个门
It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back.	门的后面就是辅导中心
So you can see the full effect!	这就是全景
But this is -- I just want to emphasize -- locally funded, locally built.	这一切 我想强调说 都是当地人自己筹款 自己建起来的
All the designers, all of the builders, everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.	所有的设计以及建造 都是靠本地人 并且是秉持公益的原则
I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great," or whatever. That was it. You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back.	我刚去过那边 对他们说 你们做得真棒 反正就是这么说 你可以在墙上看到纽约市的五个时区
So this is the space during tutoring hours.	在不同的辅导课程之间是有时间间隔的
It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention, complete devotion to the students' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas.	每天都很忙 他们会坚持一些原则 如一对一的辅导 全身心的关注孩子的作业 洋溢着乐观情绪 以及创意
And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?	这个想法 就是他们在走访店铺的时候想到的
So it's school, but it's not school.	那是一个学校 又不是一个学校
It's clearly not school, even though they're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.	很显然它不是一所学校 但是老师和孩子却是肩并肩的在一起学习

So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early -- got really addicted to finishing his homework early.	不久后 他开始写东西了 他可以很早的完成功课 并且非常认真的去做功课
It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it, and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.	要知道 做这事情是会变得上瘾的 他还可以让老师帮他看作业做得对不对 这样他就能更好的准备第二天的课
So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.	简直是做作业上瘾了 后来还做了别的事情
He's now been published in five books.	现在他已经出了五本书

Thank you so much.	谢谢
Today I want to talk about design, but not design as we usually think about it.	今天我们要来谈谈改造, 但是不是那种我们平时谈的那种改造。
I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific, biotechnological culture, where, for really the first time in history, we have the power to design bodies, to design animal bodies, to design human bodies.	我想探讨的是那些现在正在 发生在我们科学界，生物科技领域的事， 这里，是历史上真正的第一次， 我们有能力来改造生物体， 改造动物体， 改造人体。
In the history of our planet, there have been three great waves of evolution.	在我们地球的历史上， 已经经历了三次大规模的进化潮。
The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.	第一次大规模的进化潮 是我们熟知的达尔文式进化。
So, as you all know, species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments, and the pressures of those environments selected which changes, through random mutation in species, were going to be preserved.	那是，就一如你们所知的， 生物生活在特殊的生物环境 和特殊的生态环境下， 这些环境的生存压力 挑选出那些改变了的， 通过随机变异的生物体， 来进一步生存。
Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution, which was we changed the environment in which we evolved.	接着人类跳出了 达尔文式进化历史的潮流 并创造出第二个大规模的进化潮， 就是我们改变那些 让我们进化的环境。
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization.	我们通过创造文明 从而改变了我们的生物环境。
And that has been the second great -- couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years -- flow of our evolution.	这就是第二个大规模的-- 好几万年前的，15万年前-- 进化潮流。
By changing our environment, we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve.	通过改变我们的环境， 我们找寻到新的压力来 促使我们进化。
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities, all the way through modern medicine, we have changed our own evolution.	无论是通过经历农业社会， 一直经历到现代医学社会， 我们已经改变了我们的演变历程。
Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history, which has been called many things: "intentional evolution," "evolution by design" -- very different than intelligent design -- whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.	现在我们正步入进化史上第三次 大规模进化潮， 这次进化有很多别称： 意识性进化， 改造性进化-- 和智能改造很不同-- 借此我们实际现在 正在有意识的改造和改变 栖息在我们地球的生物的生物形态。
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species, as well as our cultures, because of this change.	所以我想带大家经历一场进化的暴风之旅 并接着在最后讨论一些 对于我们，对于我们种族， 同时也对于我们的文明会有什么样的影响， 从这次转变。
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.	现在我们实际上已经转变了很久了。
We started selectively breeding animals many, many thousands of years ago.	我们在数千年之前 就开始有选择的喂养动物。
And if you think of dogs for example, dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.	如果你以狗作为例子来思考， 狗是有意识的被改造的生物。
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.	在生态环境下地球上没有狗。
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like.	狗是我们 根据我们喜好而选择性喂养的产物。
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them.	但是我们在过去不得不用一种艰苦的方式 来选择那些有着特定特征的后代 来喂养它们。
We don't have to do it that way anymore.	我们再也不必在这样做了。
This is a beefalo.	这是个皮弗娄牛。
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.	皮弗娄牛是水牛和肉牛的杂交种。
And they are now making them, and someday, perhaps pretty soon, you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket.	他们现在正在研究它们， 到了某天，也许会很快， 你会在你当地的超市里 吃到皮弗娄牛肉饼。
This is a geep, a goat-sheep hybrid.	这是头山绵羊， 山羊，绵羊的杂交种。
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.	创造出这可爱小东西的科学家们 最后把它屠宰了随后吃了它。
I think they said it tasted like chicken.	我记得他们说它尝起来像鸡肉。
This is a cama.	这是匹卡马驼。
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid, created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama.	卡马驼是骆驼，美洲驼的杂交种， 为了尝试使之有骆驼的耐劳力 和美洲驼的一部分性格特点 而创造。
And they are now using these in certain cultures.	它们现已在某些环境下得到利用。
Then there's the liger.	这是狮虎兽，
This is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid.	世界上最大的猫科动物-- 狮子，老虎的杂交种。
It's bigger than a tiger.	它的体型比老虎的大。
And in the case of the liger, there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.	这个类狮虎兽的案例， 实际上在野生环境下已经被观察到一两次了。
But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology.	但是这些科学家创造的那些生物 使用了选择性喂养和基因技术。
And then finally, everybody's favorite, the zorse.	接着最后，大家的最爱， 卓斯马，
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.	没有一个是被修改过的；它们是真实的生物。
And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement, or genetic manipulation, of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics.	我们已经掌握的其中一种技术 是使用基因改良， 或者基因操控， 加以常规的选择性喂养 来推进基因的改良。
And if that were all this was about, then it would be an interesting thing.	如果这就是所有的全部， 那它是一件有趣的事。
But something much, much more powerful is happening now.	但是一些更加有影响力的事 正在发生。
These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.	正常的哺乳类动物细胞 和从深海水母上提取出的荧光基因 基因程度上融合。
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.	我们都知道一些深海动物发光。
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene, and put it into mammal cells.	嗯，他们现在已经提取出这基因，这生物发光的基因， 并把它融入哺乳动物细胞。
These are normal cells.	这是正常的细胞。
And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light.	这里你看到的 是在黑暗中发出 特定波长的光的细胞。
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.	一旦他们能在细胞上应用，他们也能用在生物体上。
So they did it with mouse pups, kittens.	于是他们把它用在幼鼠上， 小猫上。
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral, while this is from jellyfish.	顺道提一下，小猫呈现橙色小鼠呈现绿色 是因为一个的发光基因来自珊瑚， 另外一个来自水母。
They did it with pigs.	他们把它用在猪上。
They did it with puppies.	他们把它用在小狗上，
And, in fact, they did it with monkeys.	并且，实际上， 他们把它用在了猴子上。
And if you can do it with monkeys -- though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes -- if they can do it in monkeys, they can probably figure out how to do it in apes, which means they can do it in human beings.	如果你能把它作用在猴子上-- 虽然从猴子到猿事实上对于基因操作 是巨大的跃进-- 如果他们能把它作用在猴子上， 他们就可能想出如果作用在猿上， 这就意味着他们能让它作用在人类上。
In other words, it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark.	换句话说，理论上这是可能的 在很久以后我们生物技术上能够 创造出能在黑夜 发光的人类。
Be easier to find us at night.	在夜晚就更容易发现我们。
And in fact, right now in many states, you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.	实际上，现在很多州内， 你能出去买到生物荧光的宠物。
These are zebra fish.	这些是斑马鱼。
They're normally black and silver.	正常的他们是黑色和银色的。
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow, green, red, and they are actually available now in certain states.	这些斑马鱼已经被基因重组 成黄色，绿色，红色， 它们实际上如今在一些州已经能买到。
Other states have banned them.	另外一些州则被禁止。
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.	没人知道对这种生物荧光怎么做。
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA -- that controls genetically-engineered pets.	政府间没有相关部门--这不归环境保护局或者食品药物监管局管-- 来控制基因改造过的宠物。
And so some states have decided to allow them, some states have decided to ban them.	所以一些州决定允许它们， 一些州则决定禁止它们。
Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon.	你们中的一些如今可能了解 食品药物监管局对于 基因改造的鲑鱼的焦虑。
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon, using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat, to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed.	上面的鲑鱼 是被基因改造的且努克鲑鱼， 利用了这种鲑鱼 和另外一种我们食用的鱼的基因 来让它长的更快 吃的更少。
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish -- it'll be sold in the stores.	如今食物药品监管局正试着作出最后的决定 关于是否你可以食用这种鱼-- 这种鱼就会被出售。
And before you get too worried about it, here in the United States, the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it.	在你太担心它之前， 在美国， 你超市里买到的大多数食物 在包装上已经有基因改造标示。
So even as we worry about it, we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe -- without any regulation, and even without any identification on the package.	所以即使你担心它， 我们已经允许它进入这个国家--不同于欧盟-- 毫无任何条例， 甚至包装上没有任何表明。
These are all the first cloned animals of their type.	这些全是第一批它们种群的 克隆动物。
So in the lower right here, you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep -- now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh; Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat; CC the cat, for cloned cat; Snuppy, the first cloned dog -- Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy -- created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.	在右下方， 是多利，第一头克隆羊-- 如今在爱丁堡某个博物馆幸福的成为了标本； 拉尔夫鼠，第一只克隆鼠； 赛赛猫，克隆猫； 史努比，第一只克隆狗 首尔国立大学小狗史努比-- 生育于韩国 由也许你们还记得的南韩造假丑闻的同一个研究员 他最后不得不羞辱的辞职 因为他声称他已经克隆出人类细胞，其实他没有。
He actually was the first person to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do, because dog genomes are very plastic.	他实际上是第一个 克隆狗的人，其实这是个很艰苦的工作， 因为狗的基因排列的可塑性是很强的。
This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.	这是普罗提耶，第一匹马。
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy, a real "gold ring" of cloning, because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings.	它是在意大利的哈弗灵克隆马， 克隆界的一个金戒指， 因为很多赢得重要比赛的马 是被阉割的。
In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed.	换句话说，让他们成为种马的器官 已经被移除了。
But if you can clone that horse, you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud.	但是如果你能克隆这些马， 你能同时拥有阉割马在比赛上的优势 和它独特的基因组 来让它繁衍下一代。
These were the first cloned calves, the first cloned grey wolves, and then, finally, the first cloned piglets: Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.	这些是第一批克隆的小牛， 第一批克隆的灰狼。 接着，最终， 第一批克隆的小猪： 亚历克西斯，克里斯蒂娜，卡雷尔，贾妮和道蒂肯。
In addition, we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species.	另外，我们开始利用克隆技术 来试着拯救濒危物种。
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create.	现在也有作用于动物 使其能从体内制造药物和其他 我们想要的东西。
So with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create.	这山羊体内有抗凝血酶-- 这山羊已经被基因改造过了 所以它的羊奶分子 实际上包含了GTC基因 创造的抗凝血酶分子。
And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs, from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea, are pigs that they are going to use, in fact, to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them, instead of producing them in an industrial way.	接着，转基因的猪，改造过的猪， 来自于韩国的生物科学研究所， 实际上，他们用这些猪来 试着制造所有的药物 或其他工业化学物质 他们想要这些动物的 血和奶 来制造这些物质， 而不是用工业制造的方式。
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species.	这两种生物 是为了拯救濒危生物 而被创造的。
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.	瓜尔牛 是东南亚濒危蹄类动物。
A somatic cell, a body cell, was taken from its body, gestated in the ovum of a cow, and then that cow gave birth to a guar.	一个肉细胞，身体细胞， 从它身上提取出来 在一头牛的子宫中怀孕， 接着让牛生下这头瓜尔牛。
Same thing happened with the mouflon, where it's an endangered species of sheep.	同样的事也发生在这摩弗伦羊上， 它是一种濒危的羊类动物。
It was gestated in a regular sheep body, which actually raises an interesting biological problem.	它在一头普通羊体内受孕， 这实际上产生了一个有趣的生物学问题。
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.	我们体内有两种DNA。
We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA, but we also have DNA in our mitochondria, which are the energy packets of the cell.	我们有我们细胞核内的DNA 就是每个人都知道的DNA， 但是我们也有DNA在我们线粒体内， 它是细胞的能量源。
That DNA is passed down through our mothers.	这种DNA是从母系上得到传承。
So really, what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon, but a guar with cow mitochondria, and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA, and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA.	所以实际上，我们最终有的 不是一头瓜尔牛也不是头摩弗伦羊， 而是一头瓜尔牛 有着奶牛的线粒体， 因此有奶牛的线粒体DNA， 和一头摩弗伦羊有着另外一种羊的 线粒体DNA。
These are really hybrids, not pure animals.	它们实际上是杂交种，而不是纯种。
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve.	这产生了个我们如果定义生物种类的问题 在这生物技术的时代-- 一个我们还不确定如何解决的 问题。
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach.	这些可爱的生物 是亚洲蟑螂。
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball.	他们做的是 是把电极放进它的神经中枢和大脑 并在头部放置一个发射器， 它正在一个电脑追踪球上。
And now, using a joystick, they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right, forwards or backwards.	现在，使用操纵杆， 他们能把这个生物送到 实验室四周 并控制他们向左或向右， 向前或者向后。
They've created a kind of insect bot, or bugbot.	他们已经制造出一种昆虫机器， 或者叫虫器。
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.	它可能比这个差一点--或者可能比这个好一点。
This actually is one of DARPA's very important -- DARPA is the Defense Research Agency -- one of their projects.	这是事实是DARPA的一个很重要的-- DARPA就是防御远景研究规划局-- 项目。
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings.	这些歌利亚甲虫 在翅膀上有天线。
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs, and they can fly these creatures around the lab.	它们的背上捆绑这一个电脑芯片， 他们就能在实验室周围飞行这种生物。
They can make them go left, right.	他们能让它向左，向右。
They can make them take off.	他们能让它停下来。
They can't actually make them land.	实际上他们还不能让它们着陆。
They put them about one inch above the ground, and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.	他们把它们降落到地面上一英尺高 接着他们就关闭所有设备后它们就砰然落下。
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.	但是这是他们能降落的最近高度。
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired.	实际上，这项技术已经如此发达 以至于这生物-- 这是个蛾。 这是蛾的蛹期， 这也是他们设置天线 和电脑技术的时期。 所以当这蛾变成蛾的时候， 它已经被埋入天线好了。
The wires are already in its body, and they can just hook it up to their technology, and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance.	天线已经在它的体内， 他们只要把它连接和他们的技术相连接， 它们就能变成虫器 它们就能被派出作为侦查。
They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones.	他们可以把微型摄像头放在它们上面 或者某天运送 某种军用设备 去战场。
It's not just insects.	这还不仅仅用昆虫。
This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.	这是个老鼠机器，或者叫机器鼠 由美国纽约州立大学的三久·塔瓦尔研发。
Again, it's got technology -- it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres; it's got a camera on top of its head.	再一次，它包含了现代科技， 电极刺入它的左右半脑， 在它的头上有一个摄像机。
The scientists can make this creature go left, right.	科学家就能让这个生物 向左，向右走。
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.	他们能让它穿行于迷宫中，控制它的走向。
They've now created an organic robot.	他们已经创造出了生物机器人。
The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar's lab said, "Is this ethical?	在三久·塔瓦尔实验室的 研究生 说，这是道德的吗？
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal."	我们剥夺了这动物的自主权。
I'll get back to that in a minute.	我会过一会儿再讲这些。
There's also been work done with monkeys.	这技术也应用在猴子上。
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.	这是杜克的米格尔·尼古拉雷思。
He took owl monkeys, wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved, especially looking at the movement of their right arm.	他使用猫头鹰猴， 置入电极 电脑就能监视它们的大脑，当它们运动的时候， 特别是当他们右手活动的时候。
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways.	电脑会学习猴脑如何运作 用不同方式来移动它的手臂。
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm, which you see here in the picture, put the arm in another room.	接着他们把它连接到一个假肢上， 就如你能看到的一样， 把手臂放在另一个房间。
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves, to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did.	很快，电脑就学会，通过读取猴子的脑电波， 来控制另外那个房间的手臂 做任何猴子手臂在做的事情。
Then he put a video monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm, and the monkey got fascinated.	接着他把一个视频显示器 放在猴子的笼子里 给猴子看这个假肢， 结果猴子对此很着迷。
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm, this prosthetic arm would do.	猴子意识到无论她用手做什么， 那假肢也会做什么。
And eventually she was moving it and moving it, and eventually stopped moving her right arm and, staring at the screen, could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves -- which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms.	最后她会动一下动一下的， 最终会停止舞动她的右手 并，盯着屏幕， 挥舞来另外一个房间的假肢 仅仅靠她的脑电波-- 这意味着猴子 已经成为世界历史上一个拥有 三个独立功能手臂的灵长类动物。
And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals.	这不仅仅是个科级 让我们应用在动物上。
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.	这是佛罗里达大学的托马斯·迪马斯。
He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip.	它实验了2万，接着6万个 分解的鼠神经元-- 这些只是老鼠身上的分离的神经细胞-- 把它们放入芯片中。
They self-aggregated into a network, became an integrated chip.	它们会自主的连接到网络中， 成为一个完整的芯片。
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.	他把这 作为电脑芯片 来运行飞行模拟机械。
So now we have organic computer chips made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.	现在我们有了生物电脑芯片 由自主连接的神经细胞组成。
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact, independent lamprey eel brain.	最后，西北部的穆萨·伊瓦尔迪 完成了一个完整无缺的， 独立的鳗鱼脑。
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.	这就是那个鳗鱼脑。
It is living -- fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides, attached photosensitive sensors to the brain, put it into a cart -- here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart, when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart, the cart moves toward the light; when you turn it off, it moves away.	它是活着的， 完整无损的大脑浸在营养液中 通体置入了电极， 连接着大脑的光敏感应器， 然后把它放进一个推车-- 这就是那个推车，大脑就在这个里面-- 并用这个大脑作为这推车的单独的处理器， 当你打开灯照射这推车的时候， 推车会向光源移动； 当你关闭光源，它就会远离。
It's photophilic.	它是趋光性的。
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain.	现在我们有了个完整的 活体的鳗鱼脑。
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts, sitting there in its nutrient medium?	它是不是用鳗鱼的思维方式， 而浸泡在这营养液中呢？
I don't know, but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding.	我不知道， 但是事实是它是一个完整的活体的大脑 是我们试着让它保持生命活性 来行使我们的命令。
So, we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes.	所以，我们现在在一个 我们能够依照我们自己目的 创造生命的阶段。
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts.	这是只由马萨诸塞大学的查尔斯·瓦坎蒂 创造的老鼠。
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin, put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being.	他改造了这老鼠 所以它是被基因改造过的 有着更少排斥性的人类肌肤， 在它内部有着支撑耳朵的聚合脚手架 这创造出的耳朵能从老鼠体内取出 并移植给人类。
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation.	基因工程 伴随着聚合物理技术 协同异种移植技术。
This is where we are in this process.	这就是我们在这个过程中的进度。
Finally, not that long ago, Craig Venter created the first artificial cell, where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer, which is a machine, created an artificial genome, put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell.	最后，不久之前， 克雷格·范特创造出了一个人工细胞， 他用了一个真的细胞，利用DNA合成器（读取了它的染色体）， 这是一种 能制造人工染色体的机器， 再把合成器放进另一个细胞中-- 另一个细胞的染色体和第一个细胞的是不一样的-- 当第二个细胞自己复制 就复制出了第一个细胞。
In other words, that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent.	换句话说， 这是世界历史上一个用电脑作为 父母的生物-- 它没有生物意义上的父母。
And so, asks The Economist: "The first artificial organism and its consequences."	所以，《经济学家》提出 第一个人工生物和它的结局。
So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that.	你可能会想 这生物的生命 会变成看起来像这样的东西。
But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.	但是实际上，这不是弗兰肯斯坦实验室的样子。
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.	这才是弗兰肯斯坦实验室的原貌。
This is a DNA synthesizer, and here at the bottom are just bottles of A, T, C and G -- the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain.	这是个DNA合成器， 在这底部 有着标记着A,T,C和G的瓶子-- 这四种化学物质 组成了我们的DNA链。
And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.	所以，我们需要问我们自己一些问题。
For the first time in the history of this planet, we are able to directly design organisms.	作为地球史上第一次 我们能够直接设计生物体。
We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power, and it confers on us a responsibility.	我们用空前的力量操控 生物等离子体。 如果赋予我们的是一种责任。
Is everything okay?	那我们做什么都可以吗？
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want?	操控和制造任何我们想要的 生物是可行的吗？
Do we have free reign to design animals?	我们是否可以无约束 地设计生命体？
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog.	某天我们是否会根据喜好决定宠物 并说，看，我想要一只狗。
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund, the body of a retriever, maybe some pink fur, and let's make it glow in the dark"?	我想要它有达克斯猎狗的头， 猎狗的身体， 也许一些粉色的毛， 再让它在黑暗中发光。
Does industry get to create creatures who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva and other bodily fluids, create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines?	是否工业创造生物 用它们的奶，血，和唾液 和其他的体液， 来生产我们需要的药物和工业分子 并圈养它们成为生物制药机器 是可以的？
Do we get to create organic robots, where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings?	是否我们创造出生命机器， 导致这些动物失去自由 来把它们变成我们的玩物是可以的？
And then the final step of this, once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings, what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then?	接着最后的一布， 一旦我们用动物体完善了这些科技 我们就会开始在人体上运用， 这就涉及到道德界限 我们是否可能用？
It's already happening. It's not science fiction.	这已经发生了；这不是科幻小说。
We are not only already using these things in animals, some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies.	我们不仅仅已经运用在动物体内， 我们也开始运用一部分 在我们人体内。
We are now taking control of our own evolution.	我们现在在说的是控制我们自己的进化。
We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet.	我们正直接的设计 星球上的未来的物种。
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now.	它赋予了我们巨大的责任 而且不仅仅是对那些思考这问题 和论述这问题的科学家 和论理学家的责任。
It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future.	它也是每个人的责任所在 因为它关系到未来我们将会有哪些生物体 居住在这星球。
Thanks.	谢谢
Let me introduce to you Rezero.	请允许我介绍Rezero
This little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH-Zurich.	这个小家伙是 瑞士苏黎世联邦理工学院 自控系统实验室的10位本科生 设计出来地
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots.	这个机器人属于机器人家族里 球星机器人
Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball.	球星机器人靠一个球体而不是轮子 来保持自身平衡和移动
The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground.	这样一个系统的主要特征就是 它只有一个点接触地面
This means that the robot is inherently unstable.	这意味着 它一直处在不稳定状态
It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot.	就象是我金鸡独立 一样
You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable?	你也许好奇，一个连站都站不稳的机器人 有什么用呢？
Now we'll explain that in a second.	稍后我回解释
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance.	首先先解释下它是如何 保持平衡的
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.	Rezero通过一个传感器不停地检测倾斜度 来维持自身平衡
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately.	它将通过适量转动马达 来抵消倾斜的角度防止倾倒
This happens 160 times per second, and if anything fails in this process, Rezero would immediately fall to the ground.	这个过程每秒要进行160次 稍有差错 它就会立刻摔倒在地
Now to move and to balance, Rezero needs to turn the ball.	要运动和平衡 Rezero就得转动球
The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time.	这个球是由三个特殊的轮子驱动 从而它能在各个方向上运动 并同时能够 自转
Due to his instability, Rezero is always in motion. Now here's the trick.	由于其不稳定性，所以它必须一直处于动态 妙就妙在这里
It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [dynamically].	正是这种不稳定性 赋予了它动态性
Let's play a little.	让我们看看
You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push.	如果我推它一下 会有什么反应呢
In this mode, he's trying to maintain his position.	这个模式下 它会尝试 回归原位
For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael, on the computer, and Thomas who's helping me onstage.	下一个演示 首先我想介绍我的同事 操作电脑的迈克尔 和台上的托马斯
In the next mode, Rezero is passive, and we can move him around.	下一个模式里Rezero是被动的 我们可以随意移动它
With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity.	我可以几乎不费力气地 控制其位置和速度
I can also make him spin.	我也能让它旋转起来
In the next mode, we can get Rezero to follow a person.	下一个模式 Rezero跟着人走
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.	它现在与托马斯保持一段恒定距离
This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero.	这是通过它顶端的传感器 来做到的
With the same method, we can also get him to circle a person.	类似的我们也能让它 围着一个人转
We call this the orbiting mode.	我们称之为轨道模式
All right, thank you, Thomas.	谢谢，托马斯
Now, what's the use of this technology?	那么这个技术的使用价值是什么？
For now, it's an experiment, but let me show you some possible future applications.	目前它还只是个试验 但是我可以展示一下它的应用前景
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.	Rezero可以在展示会和公园里
With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way.	通过屏幕给人们指引或 带着大家愉快地四处转转
In a hospital, this device could be used to carry around medical equipment.	医院里这个设备可以成为 便携医疗设备
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around.	因为是球形机器人系统 所以它占地小移动便捷
And of course, who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these.	当然 谁不想 骑着它遛遛弯儿呢
And these are more practical applications.	这些是最实用的几个功能
But there's also a certain beauty within this technology.	但是这项技术本身 就带着美而来
Thank you.	（鼓掌） 谢谢
Thank you.	（鼓掌） 谢谢
There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.	在乳腺X光造影诊断中， 有两类女性： X光造影诊断对其中一类十分有效， 已经拯救了数千人的生命； 但对另一类却无法做出有效诊断。
Do you know which group you're in?	你是否知道你是哪一类？
If you don't, you're not alone.	你并非唯一不了解的人。
Because the breast has become are very political organ.	因为乳房已经成为 一种非常政治化的器官。
The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies.	真相正日渐式微， 淹没于各大媒体、 政治家、 放射学家、 以及医学成像公司的虚夸雄辩。
I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth.	今天早上，我将尽自己最大的努力 告诉你们我所认为的真相。
But first, my disclosures.	但首先我必须坦白，
I am not a breast cancer survivor.	我不曾战胜过乳腺癌。
I'm not a radiologist.	我也不是放射学家。
I don't have any patents, and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company, and I am not seeking your vote.	我没有任何专利， 我也从未从任何一家医学造影公司拿过一分钱。 而且我并不期待你们的投票。
What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question.	我只是 一位内服药品医生， 大约十年前， 一个病人的问题 让我对这个领域产生了浓厚的兴趣。
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump.	她来见我 她刚被诊断出一个乳房肿块。
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s.	她的姐姐在四十岁时， 被诊断为乳腺癌。
She and I were both very pregnant at that time, and my heart just ached for her, imagining how afraid she must be.	当时她和我都已经是大腹便便的孕妇了， 我为她感到心痛， 我想她该有多担心害怕。
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.	幸运的是，她的肿块是良性的。
But she asked me a question: how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one?	但她问了我一个问题： 我有多大的把握 能在她的乳房X光片中 发现早期肿瘤？
So I studied her mammogram, and I reviewed the radiology literature, and I was shocked to discover that, in her case, our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin.	于是我仔细看了她的乳房X光片， 我查阅了放射学文献， 我震惊地发现， 在她的情况下， 在乳房X光片中发现早期肿瘤的可能性， 竟然小于50%.
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s.	你大概可以想起来，一年前 那次事件大爆发， 美国预防服务工作组 审查了全球乳房X光造影诊断技术的文献， 发布了一个准则 表示不推荐四十岁的女性 使用乳房X光造影诊断。
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force, even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies.	然后所有人都指责工作组， 即使他们中根本没有人 真的了解乳房X光造影诊断。
It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage.	参议院又花了17天， 禁止在保险覆盖条例中 使用这个条例。
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines.	放射学家对这个条例 十分愤慨。
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post.	美国最杰出的乳房X光造影技术专家 在华盛顿邮报上 发表声明。
The radiologists were, in turn, criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest.	放射学家反被指责 过分关注个人经济利益。
But in my view, the radiologists are heroes.	然而我认为， 这些放射学家才是真英雄。
There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms, and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret, and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause.	一直以来，有资质看乳房X光片的 放射学家是不多的， 因为解读乳房X光片是 所有放射性研究中最为复杂的， 另外相比其他原因， 放射学家更容易因此 而被指控 误诊乳腺癌。
But that very fact is telling.	但事实胜于雄辩。
Where there is this much legal smoke, there is likely to be some fire.	哪里有硝烟， 哪里就有烈火。
The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density.	导致这场激辩烈火的重要因素 是乳腺密度。
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat -- pictured here in yellow -- versus connective and epithelial tissues -- pictured in pink.	乳腺密度是指脂肪含量- （图中黄色的部分）-- 与结缔组织含量（图中粉色部分）-- 的比例。
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined.	这个比例 主要是由基因决定的。
Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.	2/3的四十岁女性 属于高乳腺密度， 这就是为什么乳房X光造影技术无法对他们做出有效诊断的原因。
And although breast density generally declines with age, up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause.	尽管乳腺密度一般随年龄增长而下降， 仍有1/3的女性 在停经数年后 仍属于高乳腺密度的群体。
So how do you know if your breasts are dense?	那你该如何知道你是否属于高乳腺密度呢？
Well, you need to read the details of your mammography report.	你需要非常仔细地阅读 你的乳房X光片报告。
Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.	放射学家 根据乳腺组织的成像 将乳腺密度分为四类。
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense, that's called fatty-replaced.	乳腺密度小于25%， 称为脂肪替代型；
The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities, followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense.	第二种 是分散乳腺纤维密度型； 然后是混合密度型， 和最高密度型。
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense.	最后两类， 是高密度型的。
The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.	高密度乳腺所带来的问题 就好像披着羊皮的狼。
Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram, and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.	肿瘤和高密度乳腺组织 在乳房X光片上都呈现为白色， 通常X光无法辨别这两者。
So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast.	所以很容易 在此处上部的脂肪组织中看到肿瘤。
But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast.	但你无法想象 在高密度乳腺中找到肿瘤是多么困难。
That's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts, but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.	这就是为什么，乳房X光造影成像技术 可以在低乳腺密度的乳房中找到80%以上的肿瘤， 而在极高乳腺密度的乳房中只能找到40%。
Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer, but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer.	好吧，高乳腺密度已经导致 寻找肿瘤比其它情况更困难， 然而更糟的是 高乳腺密度也有力地预示 乳腺癌患病率的高风险。
It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.	它的风险系数 比母亲或姐妹有乳腺癌病史更强。
At the time my patient posed this question to me, breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature, and very few women having mammograms, or the physicians ordering them, knew about this.	当年我的病人问我这个问题时， 乳腺密度在放射性学的学术界 还未引起重视， 很少有接受乳房X光造影诊断的女性， 或者使用乳房X光造影诊断的内科医生 了解这一点。
But what else could I offer her?	但我又能为她做些什么？
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little.	乳房X光造影诊断于1960年前后开始流行， 此后几乎没有什么改进。
There have been surprisingly few innovations, until digital mammography was approved in 2000.	几乎没有令人震惊的创新， 直到2000年， 数码乳房X光造影技术被批准进入市场。
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally, just like we can with a digital camera.	数码乳房X光造影仍然使用X光， 但是图像 可以储存并进行数码操纵， 就像我们用数码相机一样。
The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment, and what have we gained from that investment?	美国已经投入 40亿美元 更新换代至数码乳房X光造影设备。 我们又从这笔投资中得到了什么呢？
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women.	一项耗费纳税人两千五百万美金的调查显示， 数码乳房X光仪 并不比传统设备 有更好的综合表现。 事实上，对老年女性来说，表现更糟。
But it was better in one group, and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts, and in those women, digital mammography found twice as many cancers, but it still only found 60 percent.	不过， 对50岁以下女性来说，表现更好， 这一群体还未绝经，且乳腺组织密度较高。 在这个群体中， 数码乳房X光诊断可以找到两倍多的肿瘤， 尽管仍只有60%。
So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind.	所以数码乳房X光造影技术 对数码乳房X光造影设备的 制造商来说， 是一次巨大的飞跃， 但对女性来说， 却只是一小步而已。
What about ultrasound?	那么超声波呢？
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used.	与其他技术相比，超声波检查必须配合 更多不必要的活组织检查， 所以并未得到广泛使用。
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive.	核磁共振在肿瘤诊断方面相当灵敏， 但它也非常昂贵。
If we think about disruptive technology, we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.	联想到其他领域的各种科技， 可以发现一种普遍存在的模式， 就是它们总是像更小、更经济的方向发展。
Think about iPods compared to stereos.	比较一下iPod和立体声音响吧。
But it's the exact opposite in health care.	但在医疗保健领域，情况则完全相反。
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive.	设备越来越大， 越来越昂贵。
Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.	女性做一次核磁共振扫描， 就像驾着悍马轰隆隆进杂货店一样。
It's just way too much equipment.	杀鸡用牛刀。
One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.	一次核磁共振扫描， 价格约为数码X光造影的10倍。
And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price.	迟早我们会接受这个现实： 医疗保健领域的创新 不可能总是如此价格高昂。
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation, and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius.	马尔科姆·葛拉威尔Malcolm Gladwell在纽约人上写过一篇 有关创新的文章， 他认为科学发现 绝非个人天才的产品，
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about.	反之，伟大的思想可以和谐交融， 如果你能把 持有各种观点的人集中在一个房间内， 让他们就一般不会谈及的事务 充分交流沟通。
It's like the essence of TED.	这其实就类似于TED的精髓了。
He quotes one innovator who says, "The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick."	他引用一位创新者的话： 只有一种情况能让内科医生和物理学家见面， 就是物理学家病了。
This makes no sense, because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions.	这说法很不对， 因为物理学家一直以来都没有意识到 他们的很多问题都是有解决办法的。
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems.	内科医生也没有意识到 他们正可以提供许多问题的解法。
Now, take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article, and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers.	看这副漫画 葛拉威尔Gladwell在文章中也引用过它， 告诉我这幅画对创新者的描绘， 是否让你感到有些困惑。
So if you will allow me a little creative license, I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution.	如果你们不介意我发挥一点创造力， 我要告诉你们一个 极其偶然的巧合， 有关我病人的问题 和一个医生的解决办法。
Shortly after her visit, I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner, who was a specialist in cardiac imaging, something I had nothing to do with.	在她拜访我之后不久， 我认识了一位核物理学家， 他来自Mayo 名叫迈克尔·奥康纳Michael OConner， 他是心血管造影的专家， 而我对心血管造影那是一窍不通。
And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.	一个偶然，他告诉我 他刚从以色列开会回来， 他们正讨论某种新型伽马探测器，
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart, and it had even been tried to image the breast.	当时伽马线造影已经出现有段时间了， 一直被用于心脏造影， 也曾有人尝试将其用于乳房造影。
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors.	但问题是 伽马线的探测器 是这种块头巨大的显像管， 里面塞满这样亮晶晶的晶状物， 你根本没有办法把它们放到距离乳房足够近的地方 去找到小肿瘤。
But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density.	但隐性的优势在于 伽马射线与X射线不同， 并不会被乳腺密度影响。
But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.	但这项技术 没有办法找到小型的肿瘤。 找到小型肿瘤对存活率非常关键。
If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases.	如果你能找到一个 直径小于1厘米的肿瘤， 存活率超过90%， 之后存活率随着 肿瘤增大而迅速下降。
But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it.	迈克尔Michael告诉我， 他见到的一种新型伽马探测器， 就是这个东西。
It's made not of a bulky tube, but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector.	它并非 由巨大的晶体管造成， 取而代之的是一层轻薄的半导体材料， 来作为伽马线探测器。
And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density, and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors.	于是我开始与他讨论 乳腺密度的问题， 我们意识到也许我们可以 把这个探测器放到距离乳房足够近的地方 去找到小肿瘤。
So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out, and we attached the new detector, and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.	接着我们 用胶带纸把这些小方块粘在一起-- --迈克尔Michael去掉了一台 即将废弃的乳房X光仪上的 X射线板。 我们连上新的探测器， 我们决定称这台机器为 分子乳房造影，简称MBI。
This is an image from our first patient.	这是我们第一位病人的造影片。
And you can see, using the old gamma technology, that it just looked like noise.	可以看到，使用古老的伽马线探测技术， 看起来一片模糊。
But using our new detector, we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.	但如果使用新的探测器， 我们可以看到肿瘤的轮廓。
So here we were, a nuclear physicist, an internist, soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer, and two radiologists, and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape.	于是我们，一个核物理学家， 一个内科医师， 之后卡丽·鲁斯卡Carrie Hruska又加入我们，一位生物医学工程师， 还有两位放射学家， 我们尝试使用一台用胶布粘起来的仪器 去拓展 造影成像技术的世界。
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system.	要说我们在早年 面对了 大量的嘲讽质疑 都只能说是轻描淡写了。 但我们都坚信我们一定会成功 我们一点一点 改进整个系统。
This is our current detector.	这是我们目前的探测器。
And you can see that it looks a lot different.	你会发现它看起来已经非常不同。
The duct tape is gone, and we added a second detector on top of the breast, which has further improved our tumor detection.	没有胶布了， 我们在乳房上方加入第二块探测器， 进一步改进了我们探测肿瘤的能力。
So how does this work?	它实际作用如何？
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells, but not by normal cells, and this is the key difference from mammography.	这位病人注射了放射性跟踪剂， 繁殖旺盛的肿瘤细胞会迅速吸收这种放射性跟踪剂， 正常细胞则不会。 这里显示造影片的巨大区别。
Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue, and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast.	造影技术依靠的就是 肿瘤组织与周边组织的突显区别， 我们看到这些区别 在高乳腺密度的乳房中很模糊。
But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.	但是MBI完整显现了 肿瘤与其他细胞的区别， 因此不受乳腺密度的影响。
After the injection, the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.	在注射后， 这位病人的乳房被置于两个探测器中间。
And if you've ever had a mammogram -- if you're old enough to have had a mammogram -- you know what comes next: pain.	如果你曾做过乳房X光造影诊断-- 如果你年龄足够大的话-- 你知道随之而来的是： 疼痛。
You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law, and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study.	你也许会很惊讶， 乳房X光造影 是唯一被联邦法律允许的放射性研究技术， 法律要求 其强度约等于一块40磅的汽车电池 砸向你的乳房。
But with MBI, we use just light, pain-free compression.	但是用MBI， 只有轻微的压痛感。
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer.	探测器 随后把图像传回到计算机。
So here's an example.	这是一个例子。
You can see, on the right, a mammogram showing a faint tumor, the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.	你可以看到右侧，X光片 显示一个成像模糊的肿瘤， 肿瘤边缘由于高密度乳腺组织而变得模糊。
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.	但MBI成像中的肿瘤，清楚多了， 还有第二个肿瘤， 这对病人的手术方案有巨大的影响。
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor, we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors -- one is small as three millimeters.	在这个例子中，X光片找到了一个肿瘤， 但我们找到了3个很难探测出的肿瘤-- 其中一个直径只有3毫米。
Our big break came in 2004.	我们的突破在2004年。
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors, we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.	在我们论证能找到小肿瘤之后， 我们用这些肿瘤成像 申请Susan G.Komen苏珊·G·科曼乳腺癌基金会的赞助。
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts, comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.	当他们最终决定在一群未曾谋面的探索者身上冒这个险时， 我们是那么的欢欣鼓舞， 他们赞助我们 研究1000名高乳腺密度的女性， 并比较她们的X光片和MBI成像。
Of the tumors that we found, mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors.	在所有我们找到的肿瘤中， X光片找到了其中的 25%
MBI found 83 percent.	MBI找到了83%。
Here's an example from that screening study.	这是此次扫描研究的例表。
The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue, but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake, which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.	数码X光片如往常一样 显示大量高密度乳腺组织， 但是MBI显示了一片高密度区域， 该区域与一个直径2厘米的肿瘤有关。
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.	在这个例子中，一个直径1厘米的肿瘤。
And in this case, a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo, who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young, wanted to enroll in our study.	这个例子， 一位来自梅奥的45岁医学秘书， 她很小时候母亲就患乳腺癌去世了， 因此她希望参与我们的研究。
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue, but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake, which we can also see on a color image.	她的X光片显示一片高密度乳腺组织， 而她的MBI显示 该区域值得忧虑， 在彩片中也可以看到。
And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball.	与此对应的 是一个高尔夫球大小的肿瘤。
But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes.	幸运的是我们摘除了它， 当时它还未扩散到淋巴结。
So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem.	所以现在我们得知这项技术 可以在高乳腺密度的乳房中找到3倍多的肿瘤， 还有一个很重要的问题需要解决。
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose, and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this.	我们必须尝试降低放射量。 最近这三年， 我们对这个造影系统的每一个细节都做了改进， 致力于降低它的放射量。
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram.	我现在非常高兴地告诉大家，我们现在使用的放射量 已经与数码X光造影的有效放射量 完全相等。
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.	使用低放射量，我们继续这项扫描研究， 这张图片，来自于3周前， 一位67岁的妇女， 其数码X光片显示一切正常， 但是MBI图像显示 这是一大片癌细胞，之后也被验证确实如此。
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.	所以这不仅仅是有益于低年龄层女性了。
It's also older women with dense tissue.	高年龄层的、乳腺密度较高的女性同样受益。
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology.	现在我们一般只使用，1/5于 其他类型伽马射线技术的放射量。
MBI generates four images per breast.	MBI对每个乳房呈现4张图像。
MRI generates over a thousand.	而核磁共振成像则超过1000张。
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding.	一个放射学家 需要很多年专业训练 才能成为辨别 普通解剖学细节组织 和真正病灶的专家。
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image.	但我猜想，这个房间里，即使你不是一位放射学专家， 你也可以在MBI成像中找到肿瘤。
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost.	然而这正是MBI 受到百般阻挠的原因。 它和核磁共振一样精确， 但又比核磁共振好辨认得多， 而且花费只是核磁共振的一个零头。
But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo.	也许你能明白 在乳房成像领域中， 有些人却安于现状，施加阻力的原因。
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals.	在获得这个我们自认为非凡的成就之后， 我们的稿件 被4家杂志拒收。
After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology.	在第四次拒收后， 我们要求对稿件进行重审， 因为我们严重怀疑 审核小组中一位拒绝此稿件的成员 在与之竞争的技术领域 有经济利益纠葛。
Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology.	之后我们的稿件被接收了 并即将在本月末刊登在 《放射学研究》期刊中。
We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose, and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions, and this could take five or more years.	我们继续用低放射量完成整个扫描研究， 然后我们的成果将需要 其它研究机构重新检验。 这可能会耗费五年或更长时间。
If this technology is widely adopted, I will not benefit financially in any way, and that is very important to me, because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.	如果这项技术被广泛运用， 我不会图取任何经济利益。 这对我很重要， 因为这一点让我坚持告诉你们真相。
But I recognize -- I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science.	但我意识到-- 我意识到要推广这项技术， 不仅需要强大的科学技术支持， 也需要经济力量 和政治力量的支持。
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved, but it's not yet widely available.	MBI已经被FDA美国食品及药物管理局批准了， 但仍未被广泛运用。
So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself.	因此在MBI面世之前， 对于高乳腺密度的女性， 有些东西你们需要了解 来保护你们自己。
First, know your density.	第一，了解你的乳腺密度。
Ninety percent of women don't, and 95 percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk.	90%的女性不了解自己的乳腺密度， 95%的女性不了解 乳腺密度的增加也会增加罹患乳腺癌的风险。
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram.	康涅狄格州成为第一个，也是唯一一个 要求女性在乳房X光片诊断后 了解 自己乳腺密度的州。
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago, and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is.	上周在芝加哥，我参加了一个 6万人与会的乳房造影技术大会。 我惊讶于看到一场激烈的辩论， 关于是否应该告诉女性 她们的乳腺密度。
Of course we should.	我们当然应该告诉她们。
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report.	如果你不知道，请询问你的医生 或者仔细研究你的乳房X光诊断报告。
Second, if you're pre-menopausal, try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle, when breast density is relatively lower.	第二，如果你还未绝经， 请尝试把你的乳房X光诊断 计划安排在月经周期的前两周， 这段时间你的乳腺密度相对较低。
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast, insist on additional imaging.	第三，如果你注意到你的乳房有一些慢性病变， 请坚持要求更多的成像检查。
And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram.	第四，也是最重要的一点， 乳房X光诊断的辩论将会持续升温， 但我坚信40岁以上的女性应该每年做一次 乳房X光检查。
Mammography isn't perfect, but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer.	乳房X光检查并不完美， 但它是目前为止唯一被验证 可以降低乳腺癌死亡率的诊断方式。
But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation.	但这个死亡率招牌 正是一把双刃剑， 乳房X光诊断的热诚簇拥者们用这把剑 来打击创新。
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later, and most women, thankfully, survive.	而另一些身患乳腺癌的女性 多年后却因它而死。 谢天谢地的是，大部分女性，活了下来。
So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer.	所以任何新的造影成像技术要花费10年 甚至更多年 来证明其诊断降低了 乳腺癌死亡率。
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim.	长久以来，乳房X光造影 是唯一有机会声明它可以降低乳腺癌死亡率的。
It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations.	但现在是时候让我们接受 乳房X光造影不仅有非凡的成功之处， 也存在许多限制。
We need to individualize screening based on density.	我们需要对不同乳腺密度的个体 使用个性化的扫描成像技术。
For women without dense breasts, mammography is the best choice.	对于低乳腺密度的女性来说， 乳房X光造影是最佳选择。
But for women with dense breasts; we shouldn't abandon screening altogether, we need to offer them something better.	但对于高乳腺密度的女性来说， 我们不该一刀子斩断所有的造影诊断技术， 我们要为她们提供更好的诊断技术。
The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school, and the answer has been so slow to come.	当年我的病人问我问题时 我们怀着的孩子 现如今已双双进入中学， 答案却还迟迟未来。
She's given me her blessing to share this story with you.	她给我祝福， 让我把这个故事与你们分享。
After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer, she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy.	在接受活组织检查后， 而活组织检查会增加患癌症风险， 以及经历被癌症夺去姐姐的痛苦之后， 她终于做出了艰难的决定， 为避免乳腺癌而做了乳房切除术。
We can and must do better, not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters, but in time for you.	我们有能力，并且必须做的更好， 这不仅是为了她的孙女， 还有我的女儿， 还有在座的各位。
Thank you.	谢谢。
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us.	我们生长在 和周围物体互动的环境里
There are an enormous number of them that we use every day.	有很多很多物品， 是我们每天都要用到的
Unlike most of our computing devices, these objects are much more fun to use.	和大部分计算机软件相比， 这些实体有趣多了。
When you talk about objects, one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing, and that is gestures: how we manipulate these objects, how we use these objects in everyday life.	当我们提到物品, 会立即出现和这东西有关的另一件事 -- 姿势: 也就是：我们怎么使用这些物品, 我们在每日生活中如何使用这些物品
We use gestures not only to interact with these objects, but we also use them to interact with each other.	我们不只运用不同姿势来使用物体 也用来和别人沟通。
A gesture of "Namaste! ", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe -- in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means "four runs" in cricket.	合十的姿势，可能是表示尊敬某人 或者是 -- 在印度，不必教，小孩都知道这是 -- 板球的4的意思
It comes as a part of our everyday learning.	这是我们的生活常识
So, I am very interested, from the beginning, that how -- how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures, and how we use these objects, can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.	所以，我一开始，就很有兴趣 想了解， -- 我们对于 日常用品和姿势的认知, 以及，如何把这些物品 运用在我们和数字世界的沟通上
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse, why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world?	为什么没有键盘和鼠标, 我就没办法使用计算机?
Rather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it.	我不是在计算机屏幕上使用它 而是拆开它，
Most of you might be aware that, in those days, the mouse used to come with a ball inside, and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving, and, accordingly, where the mouse is moving.	你们都知道，在那个年代， 鼠标里面有个球， 还有两个滚轮， 所以，当鼠标移动时， 滚轮会告诉计算机，球滚动的方向。
So, I was interested in these two rollers, and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and I now had four rollers.	我对滚轮有兴趣， 但还需要多几个，所以就跟朋友借他的鼠标 一直没还他 -- 这样就有了四个滚轮。
Interestingly, what I did with these rollers is, basically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line.	我怎么用这些滚轮呢-- 基本上，我把它们从鼠标里拿出来 放在一条在线
What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars.	 像个动作侦测装置， 成本只要两块美元。
So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made, around eight years back, in 2000.	所以，现在，不论我在实体世界做什么， 在数字的世界里就会反映出来 只要用这个我8年前做的小东西就可以, 那是2000年。
Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds, I thought of sticky notes.	我对于整合实体和数字世界有兴趣, 我想到便利贴。
I thought, "Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world?"	我想, 何不把 实体便利贴的接口，和 数字便利贴整合在一起?
A message written on a sticky note to my mom on paper can come to an SMS, or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar -- a to-do list that automatically syncs with you.	在便利贴上写给我妈妈的留言 纸条 可以用简讯传递。 或是写在纸上的会议通知 自动和我的数字行事历同步 -- 待办事项会自动在计算机上同步。
But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, "What is Dr. Smith's address?"	但你也同时可以在数字环境里搜寻, 或者是,你可以写下问题, 如, 史教授的地址?
and this small system actually prints it out -- so it actually acts like a paper input-output system, just made out of paper.	然后这个小系统就把地址打印出来 -- 这就像是个纸做的输出入系统, 用纸就可以做到.
In another exploration, I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions.	另一项探索是, 我想到用一枝可以画3D效果的笔
So, I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions, but they can actually draw so that it's more intuitive to use that way.	所以就设计出这支笔 帮助设计师和建筑师 不只以三度空间思考, 也可以画3D图形 这样用起来就更直觉多了。
Then I thought, "Why not make a Google Map, but in the physical world?"	我又想, 何不做一个实体世界的 Google地图?
Rather than typing a keyword to find something, I put my objects on top of it.	不必输入关键词来找东西, 而是放这个东西在地图上。
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is.	如果我把登机证放在地图上,它会显示登机口的位置
A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee, or where you can trash the cup.	放咖啡杯，它会显示咖啡厅的位置, 或垃圾筒的位置.
So, these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly.	这些是早期我做的实验， 我的目的是紧密衔接这两个世界.
Among all these experiments, there was one thing in common: I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world.	在这些实验之中, 有一个共通点: 我都会把实体的东西带进数字环境里.
I was taking some part of the objects, or any of the intuitiveness of real life, and bringing them to the digital world, because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.	我把物品, 或生活中，直觉式的东西, 带进数字世界里, 目的是让计算机接口更人性化
But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing.	但是后来我了解到 人们对计算机没有兴趣
What we are interested in is information.	人们有兴趣的是信息。
We want to know about things.	我们想知道更多事情.
We want to know about dynamic things going around.	我们想知道周围的各种动态
So I thought, around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- I started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?"	所以，大约在去年，去年年初的时候-- 我开始想, 我何不颠倒我的研究方向呢?
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information?"	或许, 把数字世界的数字信息， 描画在实体世界里??
Because pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets.	因为这些影像，都被包在这些方方的装置里 然后放进口袋里.
Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels?	我何不把这个形体打破 把信息放进日常生活中? 这样我也不必学新的、 和这些象素沟通的语言?
So, in order to realize this dream, I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head.	为了实现这个梦想, 我真的想过把一个投影机放在我的头上
I think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it?	这就是所谓「投影机」的意思，对吧?!
I took it very literally, and took my bike helmet, put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely.	我照着字面意思做了 我把自行车的头盔 割掉一点,让投影机可以放得进去.
So now, what I can do -- I can augment the world around me with this digital information.	这样，我可以 -- 在真实世界中用数字讯息环绕我
But later, I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels, also.	但是,后来 我想到 我也要和这些计算机像素沟通.
So I put a small camera over there, that acts as a digital eye.	所以我加了一个小摄影机, 当作数位眼睛.
Later, we moved to a much better, consumer-oriented pendant version of that, that many of you now know as the SixthSense device.	之后, 我们进一步,做成-- 使用者导向的颈挂式, 就是很多人知道的「第六感计算装置」.
But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go.	这技术最有趣的地方是 你可以把数字世界带着走 到任何地方都可以.
You can start using any surface, any wall around you, as an interface.	你可以用任何表面或墙壁， 当成界面.
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures.	这录像机随时都在侦测你的动作.
Whatever you're doing with your hands, it's understanding that gesture.	不论双手在做什么, 它都知道.
And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it.	还有，你看那些色笔 那是我们早期用的.
You can start painting on any wall.	可以在任何墙壁上画画.
You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall.	可以停在墙壁前面，开始在墙上作画.
But we are not only tracking one finger, here.	而且我们不只侦测一根手指.
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present.	我们让你可以用两只手全部, 所以可以用两只手去放大缩小-- 地图，用捏的.
The camera is actually doing -- just, getting all the images -- is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside.	录像机 -- 收集所有影像 -- 执行动作辨识和颜色辨识 有很多小程序在里面跑
So, technically, it's a little bit complex, but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense.	技术上有点复杂, 但是让人可以用的很自然
But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside.	我更兴奋的是，可以带到户外去用

Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated -- like, you have to check your computer in order to do that, right?	你的报纸会给你看动态天气报导 不必去更新数据 – 这原本，要上计算机 才找得到, 是吗?

And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life.	我相信，当这种技术和实体生活混在一起时 想象力是唯一能限制-- 我们的东西。

And many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market.	很多人很期待新一代的平板计算机 上市
So, rather than waiting for that, I actually made my own, just using a piece of paper.	与其等待 ,我干脆自己做一个﹐只用了一张纸
So, what I did here is remove the camera -- All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera.	我把录像机上的-- 所有网络度影机上都有个麦克风 .

Yeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing."	好，然后我说, OK, 这样很好, 我要打印出来.
So I now have a print-out of that thing, and now -- the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back, rather than now switching between these two worlds.	就有了一份打印文件, 这样 -- 工作流程比我们以前用的方式更人性了 像20年前的工作方式， 而不是像现在，要在两个世界里切换
So, as a last thought, I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide, the gap between these two worlds, but will also help us, in some way, to stay human, to be more connected to our physical world.	最后， 我相信把信息和所有对象整合， 不仅可以消灭数字落差、 把两个世界间的鸿沟填满, 还可以帮助我们, 保有人性, 让我们和实体世界更连结.
And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines.	最终会帮助我们，不要变成-- 坐在机器前面的另一部机器。

So with that, let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain.	带着这个问题，我先让我们看一个简短的视频 让它带着你们了解我们所希望解决的问题
We are all aware of the risk of cancer, but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.	视频我们都很关注癌症的风险 但是还有另一种疾病 能够比癌症还要影响更多的人—关节炎
Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers, arthritis ruins more lives.	癌症也许会让你死亡，但关节炎 会毁掉更多人的生活
Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance you'll develop arthritis.	假设你可活得很长命，你将有50%的概率 患上关节炎
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis.	这并不是因为年老而引起的疾病
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain, until our joints quite literally grind to a halt.	常见的损伤可以导致数十年的伤痛 直到关节经过长时间磨损而停止工作
Desperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts, but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body, shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?	我们迫切地想得到解决的方法，随之我们转向工程学 以来设计人造关节 来替代我们早已磨损且不堪重负的身体器官 但在研究新方法时 都是围绕着仿生学这一前提 我们是否应该暂时停下脚步看看有没有更好、更自然的方法
Let's consider an alternative path.	让我们一起考虑一个替代方法
What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature, or within our own stem cells?	如果我们将我们身体某一部分的需要替换为 已经存在的生物器官 又或者用我们自己的干细胞培养会怎么样
This is the field of biologic replacements, where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.	这就是生物置换领域 它将我们已磨损的器官替换为新的、自然的器官
Kevin Stone: And so, the mission is: how do I treat these things biologically?	Kevin Stone：任务就是 我们如何用生物学知识处理这类事情
And let's talk about both what I did for my wife, and what I've done for hundreds of other patients.	下面然我们谈谈，我对我的妻子 以及数以百计的病人的治疗方法
First thing for my wife, and the most common thing I hear from my patients, particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group, is they come in and say, "Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?	这是从我的妻子那里最先听到的 以及从我的患者口中 尤其是那些40-80岁年龄组中的70岁年龄组 最常听到的是 嘿，医生，我的膝盖中的放得只是一个减震器对吗
I'm not ready for joint replacement."	我并没有做好换关节的准备
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that [knee] joint space.	对我的妻子来说我对她进了半月板手术 在膝盖连接处行了同种异体的植入
And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].	这种异基因移植物替换了缺失的半月板
And then for that unstable ligament, we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee.	随后对原来的韧带进行替换 我们放入了其他人捐赠的韧带 以使她的膝盖得到稳定的支撑
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface, we did a stem cell paste graft, which we designed in 1991, to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there.	第三，则是对关节表面的损坏 我们进行了干细胞黏贴移植 这个则是我们在1991年设计出来的 可以使得关节软骨组织再生 使他们还原为光滑的表面
So here's my wife's bad knee on the left, and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen, and doing well.	左边这个是我爱人原已损坏的膝盖 但是看右边，她在四个月后的Aspen 已经可以徒步旅行了，并且一切都很好
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.	手术成功了，但并这个成功并不仅仅局限于我的爱人，其他患者也同样受益
The girl on the video, Jen Hudak, just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee, as you see in the other image -- and having a paste graft to that knee.	视频中的女孩，Jen Hudak 刚刚在Aspen赢得了雪道滑雪 而这发生在她膝盖损坏后的九个月 正如你们看到视频 她有着经过干细胞修复过的膝盖
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.	所以我们从生物学的角度将是可以修复关节表面的
So with all this success, why isn't that good enough, you might ask.	所以经过了这些的成功 你们也许会问为什么还不够好呢
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.	这是因为还没有足够的数据来支撑这个实践
There's not enough young, healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us.	没有足够健康的年轻人 从他们的模特车上摔倒 并且将他们的器官捐赠给我们
And the tissue's very expensive.	并且这个手术十分昂贵
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.	这就是这个办法没有得到普及的原因 也使得我们将事业放眼于全球去寻找合适的生物组织
But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful, it's cheap, you can get it from young, healthy tissues, but the barrier is immunology.	随后我们用动物组织进行替代 因为生物组织可以随处找到，并且价格也不高 并且可以得到年轻、健康的生物组织 但是，该种方法的障碍就是免疫问题
And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl, or gal epitope.	这种特别的障碍是由 特殊的抗原决定基所导致 这种抗原决定基就是半乳糖基
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people, we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.	所以，如果我们想将动物组织移植到人类的身体上 则必须找到一种方法去除掉半乳糖基
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984.	所以我的工作 从1984年开始研究动物组织
And I started first with cow Achilles tendon, where we would take the cow Achilles tendon, which is type-I collagen, strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template.	我首先从 牛的跟腱开始 我们可以将牛的跟腱中的 一种胶原质 从其抗原中分离 进过一种酸和清洁剂的冲洗降解 使其成为一种再生模板
We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee.	我们随后可以将这个再生模板 插入半月板软骨撕裂处 让其在患者的膝盖再生
We've now done that procedure, and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases, so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus.	直到现在，通过使用这种方法 我们已经在全球范围内治愈了逾4000位患者 所以这是一个可以被美国食品及药物管理局以及全世界所接受的 膝盖半月板再生法
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue.	而且当我们能够降解生物组织时将会更好
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?	但是，当你需要一个完整的韧带时
I can't grind it up in a blender.	我不能将其在搅拌机里将其磨碎
So in that case, I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek -- an enzyme wash to wash away, or strip, those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme.	所以，这种情况下 我必须进行研究设计，与我一起设计的还有Uri Galili和Tom Turek 我们一起设计一种酶洗之法 用一种特殊的酶 以洗掉或脱离掉 那些半乳糖抗原决定基
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique.	这种酶素洗法我们称之为半乳糖脱离技术
What we do is humanize the tissue.	我们所做的就是将组织做的更加人性化
It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it , and then we can put it back into a patient's knee.	用半乳糖脱离法 我们可以将其处理的更加接近人的组织 然后我们就可以 将这个组织放回患者的膝盖处
And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament -- young, healthy, big tissue, put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial -- and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships -- on his "pig-lig," as he calls it.	我们已经做过这个实验，现在我们采用猪的韧带 年轻的、健康的、大的组织 将其放入是为患者的体内，当然这个实验是经过美国食品药品监督管理局的批准 不久，其中一位患者就继续参加了 三个加拿大斜坡大师冠军赛 当然，这都是经过他自己称之为猪膝盖的做功。
So we know it can work.	这让我们了解到这种方法管用
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending.	而且，一个更大规模的临床试验将要进行
So what about the next step?	那么我们的下一步将会做什么
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement, not just the parts?	做一个整体生物膝盖置换怎么样 不再局限于一个部分
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?	我们如何对人在关节置换进行革命性改变
Well here's how we're going to do it.	这就是我们如何做这件事情
So what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young, healthy pig, strip it of its antigens, load it with your stem cells, then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee, tack it on there, have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee.	我们将会用一个 来自年轻、健康的猪的 关节软骨 剥离掉它的抗原 载上你自己的干细胞 然后将其放回 你自己膝盖处的关节 将其固定，让你自己治愈破损的表面 并让其自己为你的膝盖生长一个新的生物表面
So that's our biologic approach right now.	这就是我们现在的生物方法
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.	我们可以用部分组织让你的膝盖得以重生
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.	我们将原组织表面生成一个全新的表面
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom.	但是，我们可以从动物王国哪里得到其他的利益
There's a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation.	这个利益是他们有四亿年的 移动历史
We can harness those benefits.	我们可以利用那些有事
We can use thicker, younger, better tissues than you might have injured in your knee, or that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.	我们可以利用那些更加厚实、年轻 比你自身更好的组织 或比你40、50、60岁时更好的组织
We can do it as an outpatient procedure.	我们可以将其发展为门诊式的程序
We can strip that tissue very economically, and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global.	我们还可以将脱离技术发展为更为经济的方法 这就是我们如何在全球范围内 获得生物膝盖置换的方法
And so welcome to super biologics.	欢迎进入生物学的世界
It's not hardware.	他不是硬件
It's not software.	也不是软件
It's bioware.	是生物部件
It's version 2.0 of you.	是你身体部件的第二代
And so with that, coming to a -- coming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe.	我深信不久人们将会在 各个医院中见到它的使用
Thank you very much.	谢谢
Okay, I'm going to show you again something about our diets.	好了，我向大家再次展示 我们饮食中的食用昆虫。
And I would like to know what the audience is, and so who of you ever ate insects?	我想知道观众中有多少人吃过昆虫。 大家曾吃过昆虫吗？
That's quite a lot.	非常多。
But still, you're not representing the overall population of the Earth.	但尽管如此，你们并不代表 这地球上的所有人。
Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.	因为地球上百分之八十的人食用昆虫。
But this is quite good.	但在场吃过昆虫的人也相当多了。
Why not eat insects?	为什么不吃昆虫呢？
Well first, what are insects?	首先，什么是昆虫？
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs.	用六条腿行走的动物就是昆虫。
And here you see just a selection.	你在这图中看到的昆虫仅是一部分。
There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species.	在这地球上，有六百万种昆虫， 六百万种。
There's a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects.	哺乳动物仅有几百种， 昆虫却有六百万种。
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers.	事实上，假如我们考虑所有生物个体， 我们会得到更大的数目。
In fact, of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs.	事实是地球上所有的动物， 所有动物种类， 百分之八十的物种都是六条腿行走的动物。
But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth.	但如果我们计算所有的个体， 称量他们的平均重量， 昆虫平均重量会是200到2000公斤， 相比起地球上，你我中的每一个而言。
That means that in terms of biomass, insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men, but we're on a planet of insects.	在生物量上， 昆虫比我们人类要更加充足。 其实我们不是生活在一个人类星球上， 而是在一个昆虫星球上。
Insects are not only there in nature, but they also are involved in our economy, usually without us knowing.	昆虫不仅仅存在于自然界， 它们还跟我们的经济息息相关， 只是通常人们没有察觉。
There was an estimation, a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year.	几年前，有个 保守的估计， 美国经济每年 因昆虫而获益五百七十亿 美元。
It's a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.	这对美国经济是个非常大的 贡献，而且是无偿的。
And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year.	接着我查看了同一年美国经济 在伊拉克战争的支出是多少 。
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.	八百亿美元。
Well we know that that was not a cheap war.	我们都知道伊拉克战争 花费不菲。
So insects, just for free, contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude, just for free, without everyone knowing.	而昆虫， 它们 以同样的数百亿美元 对美国经济作出的无偿贡献，却鲜为人知。
And not only in the States, but in any country, in any economy.	昆虫的贡献不只局限于美国， 而是对世界上任何一个国家，任何一个经济体。
What do they do?	昆虫都做了什么？
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops.	它们清除粪便，给农作物授粉。
A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.	我们食用水果中的三分之一 都是 靠它们传粉长成的。
They control pests, and they're food for animals.	他们抑制害虫。 也是其他动物的食物来源。
They're at the start of food chains.	昆虫位于食物链的底端。
Small animals eat insects.	小动物吃昆虫。
Even larger animals eat insects.	大动物也不例外。
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals.	但食用昆虫的小动物 也会被大一点的动物， 甚至更大型的动物捕食。
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.	在食物链的末端，是我们人类食用这些动物。
There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.	相当多的人吃昆虫。
And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang -- about two million inhabitants.	这幅图，大家看到我 在中国的一个小省城，丽江-- 这里大约有2百万居民。
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant, where you can select which fish you want to eat, you can select which insects you would like to eat.	如果你外出就餐，就像在鱼庄， 你可以选择你想吃的鱼类产品一样， 选择你想吃的昆虫食品。
And they prepare it in a wonderful way.	他们会烹饪出非常特别的昆虫佳肴。
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars, locusts, bee pupae -- delicacies.	所以你看到的是，我在享用一顿， 有毛毛虫和蚱蜢， 蜜蜂等的美味佳肴。
And you can eat something new everyday.	每天你都可以尝个鲜。
There's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe.	全球各地，人们正在食用1000余种 的昆虫。
That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep.	种类远远多于 人们食用的那么几种哺乳动物， 例如牛，猪， 或者羊。
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety.	1000多种-- 极其丰富。
And now you may think, okay, in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.	现在大家可能会想， 那只是这个中国小城镇的人这么吃罢了，我们可不这样。
Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally, but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects, without any exception.	可是，我们已经看到在场的很多人 都吃过昆虫，尽管有些只是偶然吃了一次。 但我要告诉大家，我们每个人都吃昆虫， 无一例外。
You're eating at least 500 grams per year.	大家每年至少吃 500克昆虫。
What are you eating?	这怎么会呢？
Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles -- any processed food that you're eating contains insects, because insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops.	番茄汤，花生酱， 巧克力，面条-- 你吃过的任何加工食品 都含有昆虫， 因为昆虫就在我们身边， 它们在外边自然界中， 它们也在我们的农作物中。
Some fruits get some insect damage.	一些水果进了虫有些损害。
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato, that go to the tomato soup.	如果是番茄， 他们就被制成番茄汤。
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.	如果它们完好无损，则会被售往杂货店。
And that's your view of a tomato.	这是你们看到的是番茄。
But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup, and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency, there can be all kinds of things in there, no problem.	但还有被制成汤的番茄。 只要它们符合 食品署的要求， 加工食品里可以有各种各样的东西， 这没有问题。
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup, there's meat in there anyway?	事实上，我们为什么还往汤里放肉丸呢？ 里面不早就有昆虫肉了吗？
In fact, all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of.	其实，我们所有的加工食品 所含的蛋白质 比我们想象的要多得多。
So anything is a good protein source already.	所以加工食品都是不错的蛋白质的来源。
Now you may say, "Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."	现在大家会说， 好吧，我们只是不小心吃了500克的昆虫。
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye.	 在幻灯片中，我这儿仅有2个例子 -- 粉红色的饼干和蟹肉条 又或者，堪培利开胃酒。 我们许多食物生产中的红色 都是用天然色素染成的。
The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal.	蟹肉棒 就是蟹肉，或被卖成蟹肉， 它是白鱼 被染上胭脂红。
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti.	而胭脂红是提取于 一种靠仙人掌生活的昆虫产品。
It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business.	胭脂红 以每年150到180公吨大量生产， 在秘鲁的加那利群岛， 这是笔大买卖。
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros.	一克胭脂红 价值约30欧元。
One gram of gold is 30 euros.	一克黄金 也是30欧元。
So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods.	所以胭脂红是非常宝贵的东西， 我们用它来给食物染色。
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me, for everyone on this Earth.	现在全球情况正在变化， 对你我，地球上每个人而言。
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially.	人口总数正快速地， 成倍地增长着。
Where, at the moment, we have something between six and seven billion people, it will grow to about nine billion in 2050.	目前地球上有 60亿到70亿人口， 到2050年，总人口数会增加到 约90亿。
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed, and this is something that worries more and more people.	这意味着我们有更多的人口要养活。 这是个让越来越多人担忧的问题。
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this.	去年十月粮农组织大会 特此就这问题而召开。
How are we going to feed this world?	我们将怎样养活这个世界？
And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent.	请注意上边粮农组织的数据， 它说我们还有多于现在三分之一的人口要养活， 但这需要农业生产提高 百分之七十。
And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat.	这尤其是因为世界人口总数 在增加， 不仅仅是数量的增加， 而且我们也变得富有了， 人们一旦富裕了就会开始吃更多的食物 也开始吃更多的肉。
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.	实际上，肉类食品的 农业生产成本 很高。
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game.	我们饮食由许多动物蛋白质组成， 目前，在这儿，我们中多数人 从家畜， 鱼类，或野味中获取动物蛋白质。
And we eat quite a lot of it.	我们吃很多肉。
In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year.	在发达国家，平均每人每年食用 80公斤的肉， 美国的平均值 更是高达120公斤， 其他一些国家稍微低点， 但平均下来是 每人每年80公斤。
In the developing world it's much lower.	在发展中国家这个平均值要低得多。
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.	每人每年25公斤。
But it's increasing enormously.	但增长很快。
In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing.	在中国过去20年中， 这平均值从20公斤增加到了50公斤， 这将会持续下去。
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat.	那么如果世界人口的三分之一 正增加他们的肉消费 平均从25公斤增长到80公斤， 另外，世界人口的三分之一 正生活在中国和印度， 我们对肉类食品的需求会变得相当大。
And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them.	当然，我们不是说， 肉食需求只是对我们而言，不用考虑他们。
They have the same share that we have.	他们和我们一样，享有同等的需求。
Now to start with, I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world.	我必须说， 在西方国家， 我们吃的肉太多了。
We could do with much, much less -- and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time, and you can easily do without anything.	我们其实只需要吃很少就可以， 我知道因为我食素已经很久了。 大家能很容易地做到这一点。
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.	从任何食物中都能获取蛋白质。
But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production, and we're being faced with that more and more often.	然而肉类食品的生产， 却带有很多问题， 而且这些问题会越来越普遍。
The first problem that we're facing is human health.	我们要面对的第一个问题是人类健康。
Pigs are quite like us.	猪很像我们人类。
They're even models in medicine, and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.	在医学上，猪是人类的临床试验的替代品。 我们甚至可以把猪的器官移植到人身上。
That means that pigs also share diseases with us.	这表明猪和人类有很多共同的疾病。
And a pig disease, a pig virus, and a human virus can both proliferate, and because of their kind of reproduction, they can combine and produce a new virus.	而猪的疾病， 猪的病毒，和人类的病毒 都能繁殖并扩散。 正因为这种繁殖系统， 猪和人携带的病毒可能变异，并生成一种新病毒。
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak.	1990年代荷兰发生过的 典型猪疫就是这么一例。
You get a new disease that can be deadly.	产生的这种新疾病是会致命的。
We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen.	大家吃昆虫，因为昆虫和我们非常不相像， 所以这种病毒的变异不会发生。
So that's one point for insects.	这是食用昆虫的一点。
And there's the conversion factor.	还有转换因素。
You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.	用10公斤饲料， 大家可以得到1公斤的牛肉， 但也可以得到9公斤的蚱蜢肉。
So if you would be an entrepreneur, what would you do?	要是你是个企业家， 你会做什么？
With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output.	10公斤的投入， 你会得到也许1公斤或者9公斤的产出。
So far we're taking the one, or up to five kilograms of output.	目前，我们只是选择了这 1公斤，或者5公斤的产出。
We're not taking the bonus yet.	我们还没选择那红利
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.	那9公斤的产出。
So that's two points for insects.	这是昆虫的第二点好处。
And there's the environment.	还有环境。
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure.	我们假如用10公斤饲料-- 它会产出1公斤牛肉， 和其他9公斤的排泄物， 许多是粪便。
If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce.	假如你生产昆虫，你生产每公斤的昆虫肉， 你有更少的粪便。
So less waste.	更少的排泄物。
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure.	此外，每公斤昆虫粪便 产生的氨 和温室气体， 比起牛的粪便 要少得多。
So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung.	那么昆虫有更少的排泄物， 而且昆虫排泄物不像牛粪一样 对环境有害。
So that's three points for insects.	这是昆虫的第三点好处。
Now there's a big "if," of course, and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality.	当然还有个大疑问， 那就是昆虫是否能有肉类食品 那样高的营养价值。
Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins, it's very good.	所有分析表明 昆虫的蛋白质，脂肪，还有维他命 都非常丰富。
In fact, it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment.	事实上，它可以 和目前我们吃的任何肉食相媲美。
And even in terms of calories, it is very good.	即使按热量来衡量，昆虫也是很不错的。
One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.	比起10个热狗，或者6个巨无霸， 一公斤蚱蜢能提供同等的 卡路里。
So that's four points for insects.	这是食用昆虫的第四点好处。
I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this.	我可以继续说 许多食用昆虫的好处， 但时间不容许。
So the question is, why not eat insects?	所以问题是，为什么不食用昆虫呢？
I gave you at least four arguments in favor.	我已经给了大家至少4个食用昆虫的理由。
We'll have to.	我们得亲自试试。
Even if you don't like it, you'll have to get used to this because at the moment, 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock.	即使你不喜欢吃昆虫， 你也得学着去适应它。 因为目前， 我们农业用地的百分之七十 都在用来饲养牲畜。
That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding, but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported.	这不仅包括 牲畜圈养地和喂养的地方， 还包括 用于生产和运输的饲料储存地。
We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests, but there's a limitation very soon.	我们可以增加一点农业用地， 牺牲雨林， 但不久这就会到一个极限。
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way.	如果大家记得，我们需要提高 农业生产百分之七十， 但我们做不到这点。
We could much better change from meat, from beef, to insects.	所以我们最好 从肉食，从牛肉， 转变到食用昆虫。
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere.	世界上百分之八十的人 已经食用昆虫， 我们只是少数的一部分人， 例如来自英国，美国， 荷兰等其他地方的少数一部分不食用昆虫的人。
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.	在左手边，你看到的是老挝的市场 那里，人们会大量买卖 各种各样的昆虫，用来做晚餐。
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.	在右手边，你看到的是蚱蜢。
So people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy.	那里的人们吃蚱蜢， 不是因为他们没有肉吃， 而是因为他们觉得昆虫很美味。
It's just very good food.	昆虫是非常棒的食物。
You can vary enormously.	人们可以享用很多种类的昆虫。
It has many benefits.	这有很多好处。

Now, I know you don't believe me, really, here.	现在我知道 你们在这里，实际上不相信我。
So here's exhibit number one.	所以这儿给大家看第一个例子。
I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez, a libertarian who works at the, for many people, "evil" Cato Institute.	我想和你们分享我的最新英雄，朱利安桑切斯， 一个自由工作者为大家而工作， 邪恶的卡托研究所
Okay, so Julian made this video.	好，所以朱利安制作了这个短片
He's a terrible producer of videos, but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.	他是一个糟糕的视频制作人， 但是内容很棒，所以我给大家分享一点。
So here he is beginning.	这儿是开头。
Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ...	朱利安桑切斯：我将告诉大家一个发现 一个关于混合文化衍化的方式。
Larry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos.	拉里莱斯格：所以他在开始告诉我们 关于这三个视频。
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania.	这是一个很棒的混音作品 定为李斯特狂
Which, of course, spread virally.	当然传播的很快
Hugely successful.	取得巨大的成功
And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.	然后一些来自布鲁克林的人看到了它。

And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.	他们做得相当漂亮，但是这种自由主义 有很多重要的教训值得我们吸取。
Here's lesson number one.	第一条。
JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.	朱利安：显而易见这其中有着深刻而伟大的东西。
They are acting in the sense that they're emulating the original mashup.	他们即兴表演 模仿原来的混音
And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing.	而且拍摄这作品的家伙很有眼光 并有不少视频编辑的经验
But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together.	但基本上这个作品也只是由一群好朋友 相互有着真实的社交活动 并聚在一起。
It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party with a group of good friends.	这似乎听起来熟悉并且合理 对于那些参加长时间歌唱和舞蹈派对的人们 有着这样一群好友
LL: Or ...	拉里：或者
JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here, remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement; it becomes an act of social creativity.	朱利安：所以与我们看到的早期的视频有很大区别 因为在这里，混合的不仅仅是 一个独立的基本事物； 它成为了一种社会创造力的体现。
And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end, it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.	并且他不局限在自身 最终诞生一种新的产品， 它具有改变我们相互依赖方式的潜力。
All of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression.	我们所有的社会互动 成为了一种邀请 对于这种集体表达。
It's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art.	这使我们真实社会活了起来 这就转变成了艺术。
LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...	拉里：所以这为自由主义者提出这两点
JS: One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.	朱利安：一种混搭是关于 独立地使用我们共享的文化 好比一种与听众沟通的语言。
Stage two, social remix, is really about using it to mediate people's relationships to each other.	第二阶段，社会混搭， 这才是真正吧它当成一种媒介 连接人与人之间的关系。
First, within each video, the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group.	首先，在这视频中， 后起之秀的角色被当作一种样本 用来表现每个团体的社会现实
But there's also a dialogue between the videos, where, once the basic structure is established, it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds.	但是这些视频之间也存在对话， 一旦基本结构建立起来后， 它就成为了一种平台 做为表述相似与区别的平台 在不同的社团和物理世界中存在。
LL: And then, here's for me, the critical key to what Julian has to say ...	拉里：然后，对我而言， 这个评论的要点是 朱利安必须说。
JS: Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity; it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities -- social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture.	朱利安：版权政策不仅仅关于 如何奖励作品的作者 那些特定种类的艺术家团体 它还关系到能控制哪一层面 我们可以允许它们被用来 控制我们的社会现实， 社会现实在现在必然地， 被流行文化渗透。
I think it's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.	我认为这很重要 我们在心中保留两种不同的公共物品
If we're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one, I think we risk suppressing this different and richer and, in some ways, maybe even more important one.	如果我们只是将目光放在 供应如何最大化 我认为我们应冒险放弃这一点 区分并且丰富 一些在其他层面看来更重要的东西。
LL: Right.	拉里：对，正是这点。
Freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture.	自由需要这个机会 获取商业成功 作为商业作品 并且建立不同 种类文化的机会
And for that to happen, you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected, to enable this kind of innovation, as this libertarian tells us, between these two creative cultures, a commercial and a sharing culture.	为了这个目标，你需要 很多点子用来保护公平使用 使得这种启发可能 正如自由主义者告诉我们的， 在这两种创造性的文化之间， 有着一个商业的和另一个可分享的文化
The point is they, he, here, gets that culture.	重点是他们，他，这里， 获得那种文化。
Now, my concern is, we Dems, too often, not so much.	现在，我担心的是，我们民主党人， 常常，不是那么多。
All right, take for example this great company.	好，以这个大公司为例子。
In the good old days when this Republican ran that company, their greatest work was work that built on the past, right.	在美好的过去，共和党人曾经经营这个公司， 他们的出色工作建立了过去的辉煌。
All of the great Disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them, or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them, to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.	所有杰出的迪斯尼作品 都是来源于其他作品 那些作品属于公共领域的并且被重新解构 或者等到他们进入了公有领域再重构他们， 庆祝这个附加的创意
Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course, as "Steamboat Willie," is a remix of the then, very dominant, very popular "Steamboat Bill" by Buster Keaton.	事实上，米老鼠自身出现在 汽船威利号的形象 就是借鉴当时非常流行的 汽船比利号 由巴斯特·基顿创作
This man was a remixer extraordinaire.	他才是一位杰出的再创作大师
He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity.	他值得称颂 拥有这种创造力
But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat.	但是公司把历史掩盖了 通过政治黑幕背后的交易 给这位民主党人
Wildly different.	截然不同的待遇
This is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, extending the term of existing copyrights by 20 years, so that no one could do to Disney what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.	幕后的罪魁祸首 正是臭名昭著的 松尼波诺著作权期延长法案 将现有的版权年限 延长了20年 所以没有人可以对迪斯尼做 他们曾对格林兄弟所做的事
Now, when we tried to challenge this, going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there -- if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down, we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right-wing Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman, who said he would join our brief only if the word "no brainer" was in the brief somewhere.	现在当我们试图挑战这点时 都要去最高法院接受那儿一群保守派的审判 如果我们让他们醒悟过来看到这一点然后推翻它。 我们有诺贝尔得主的帮助 包括这位右翼人士 诺贝尔奖得主，米尔顿弗里德曼 曾说过他将加入我们部门 只要脑残这个词 能贴在办公室的某个地方。
But apparently, no brains existed in this place when Democrats passed and signed this bill into law.	(笑声） 但很明显，没有脑残 曾经在这里存在过 当民主党通过并签署法案 将它正式变为法律
Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote: Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican, but I don't buy it.	现在，我进行一个注解， 松尼波诺，也许你会说，他曾是共和党人， 但是我不买账。
This guy is no Republican.	这家伙绝不是共和党。
Okay, for a second example, think about this cultural hero, icon on the Left, creator of this character.	好的，举第二个例子， 想一想这个文化英雄， 左派人物， 这个角色的创造者。
Look at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps, inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.	看看他建立的网站：星球大战恶搞， 邀请人们来这里使用他们的创作激情 去吸引新一代的注意力 对于这个杰出的重要文化象征。
Read the license.	读一下许可证。
The license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to Lucas.	对于这些再创作者的许可 赋予了所有权利 混搭作品版权属于卢卡斯
The mashup is owned by Lucas.	这些混搭是卢卡斯所有的。
Indeed, anything you add to the mashup, music you might add, Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free.	实际上，你添加的任何元素， 也许是一段音乐， 卢卡斯有了一个全世界范围的版权 免费的去开拓。
There is no creator here to be recognized.	在这里没有公认的创作者。
The creator doesn't have any rights.	创作者没有任何权力。
The creator is a sharecropper in this story.	在故事里，创作者成了农民工。
And we should remember who employed the sharecroppers: the Democrats, right?	我们应该记住 谁雇佣了这些佃农? 民主党，不是吗？
So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership, a respect for ownership, the respect we should give the creator, the remixer, the owner, the property owner, the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff, and not a generation of sharecroppers.	所以要点是共和党在这 认识到有这样的需求 需要所有权 尊重所有权， 我们应该给予创作者的， 再创作者，拥有者，财产所有者， 版权所有者 这个非常棒的玩意 而不是一代佃农。
Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here, lessons about openness.	现在 关于开放的教训。
Our lives are sharing activities, at least in part.	我们的生命是分享的活动， 至少部分是。
Even for the head of Goldman Sachs, at least in part.	即使是高盛公司的老板， 也有分享的部分。
And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have well-protected spaces of fair use.	为了使得这样的分享可以实现，我们必须 保护好公平使用的空间。
That's number one.	这是第一点。
Number two: This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create.	第二点： 分享的生态环境 需要自由 在自由中创作。
Freedom, which means without permission from anyone, the ability to create.	自由意味着没有任何人的允许， 有创作的能力。
And number three: We need to respect the creator, the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them.	第三点：我们需要 尊重创作者， 这些混搭作品的作者 通过将权力 与他们直接相连。
Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit Creative Commons.	这也可以解释为何右翼会热衷于非盈利 的创意共享
Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit, but of course -- let me just tie it here -- the Creative Commons, which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry.	实际上，这不只是一个右翼非盈利活动 让我把它联系到 创意共享 即让作者有了这个简单的方法标注他们的内容 在自由的条件下 只要他们想加上。
So that we go from a "all rights reserved" world to a "some rights reserved" world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content, building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work.	所以我们从一个版权所有的世界 变为版权部分所有的世界 所以大家可以知道他们赋予作品内容的这种自由， 建立和创作 基于这种自由 创新已有版权的作品。
These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely.	这些我们发明的工具 使得分享成为了一部分 通过许可明确了 自由创作的权力 在没有事先允许的情况下 因为一开始就给予了许可， 以及对原创者的尊重因为它建立在 原创者的版权之上 已经被允许自由使用。
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses, as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there, licensed freely in this way.	这揭示了泛右翼论阴谋 很明显围绕这些协议不断发展， 至今已有3亿5000万数字作品 存在并允许自由使用 以这样的方式。
Now that picture of an ecology of creativity, the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity, is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?	现在那是一幅创造性生态图， 一幅生态平衡的 由创作环境， 这样的创作生态我们现在拥有了么？
Well, as you all know, not many of us believe we do.	正如大家知道的， 没有几个人相信我们有。
I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week.	我就在现实的创作环境中栽了个跟头 就在上周。
I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I'd given, and I uploaded it to YouTube.	我制作了一个视频是基于 我的一个演讲 我把它上传到了Youtube
I then got this email from YouTube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious WMG that matched their content ID.	然后我就收到了Youtube发来的电邮 莫名其妙的告知我 这些内容 不可思议的属于WMG公司 因为符合他们作品的特征
So I didn't think much about it.	我并没怎么当回事
And then on Twitter, somebody said to me, "Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd.	接下来在推特上，有个人和我说， 你在Youube上的谈话被判侵权。
Was that your purpose?"	你是故意的吗？
imagining that I had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.	想象一下如果我有这样险恶的阴谋 去揭露新千年数字版权法案显而易见的瑕疵。
I answered, "No."	我答道：不。
I didn't even think about it.	我根本没有想到那样做。
But then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.	但随后我上了那个网站 我所有的语音被静音了。
My whole 45-minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video, a video about fair use, that included Warner Music Group music.	我全长45分钟的视频 全部没有声音 因为这里面有一点点内容， 关于公平使用视频， 包含了华纳音乐集团的音乐。
Now, interestingly, they still sold ads for that music, if you played the silent video.	现在，有趣的是， 他们依然为那段音乐卖广告， 如果你播放了那段静音的视频。
You could still buy the music, but you couldn't hear anything because it had been silenced.	你仍然可以购买那段音乐， 但你听不到任何声音 因为被静音了。
So I did what the current regime says I must do to be free to use YouTube to talk about fair use.	所以我做了目前政府 让我必须做的 去自由使用 YouTube谈论公平使用。
I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.	我打开那个页面，我必须回答这些问题。
And then in an extraordinarily Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way you've actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak.	然后在一个令人叫绝的的 像巴特·辛普森一样，幼稚的方式 你必须输入这些单词 并得到允许 去宣称你的言论自由
And I felt like I was in third grade again.	我感到我回到了小学三年级，
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.	我保证我不会把大头钉再放到老师椅子上。
I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."	我保证我不会把大头钉再放到老师椅子上。
This is absurd.	这很荒唐。
It is outrageous.	太离奇了。
It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging.	这是对自由系统的扭曲 我们应该倍受鼓舞
And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?	我想问的是：谁在为此而奋斗？
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election, who was the number one, active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech?	是的，有趣的是，在上次总统大选中， 谁是头号积极分子 在反对这个行政系统 对在线发言的限制？
John McCain.	是约翰麦凯恩。
Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system, that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the Internet.	一份有一份批评Youube的封锁 倡导更值得尊敬的公平使用 凭借他们杰出的注意力并终止这个系统， 让他的竞选活动无数次的 被因特网抛弃。
Now, that was the story of me then, my good old days of right-wing lunacy.	现在，讲讲我自己的故事， 我美好的的右派疯狂岁月。
Let me come back to now, now when I'm a little leftist -- I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty -- And I wonder, can we on the Left expect to build this ecology of freedom, now, in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it, where even icons of the Left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government-funded research?	让我回到当下， 现在当我作为一个小小的左倾分子 至少我是一个左撇子 我想知道，我们能否站在左翼 期望去建立一个 自由的生态系统，就现在， 在世界的某个地点 我们知道有股强大的力量 会反对它， 甚至像这位左派的领袖 致力推进法案 有效地禁止那些要求 开放给政府资助地科研？
The president, who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements, which effectively lock us into the insane system of DMCA that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.	总统本人，曾支持过 一个秘密协商的进行， 结果把我们困在了一个愚蠢的系统里 即数字千年版权法 我们已被迫适应 并被置于棒球中三震出局的境地 当然越来越多的国家也卷入了这个适应的过程。
Not a single example of reform has been produced yet.	没有一例改革的例子 被推动过。
And we're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon.	并且我们将看不到任何改变 在这个系统里 至少近期无望。
So here's the lessons of openness that I think we need to learn.	所以这是关于开放的教训 我认为大家都要吸取
Openness is a commitment to a certain set of values.	开放式一种奉献 奉献一系列的价值。
We need to speak of those values.	我们需要强调那些价值。

It's a value of community.	它具有公共团体的价值。
It's a value of the limits in regulation.	它具有制约规章的价值。
It's a value respecting the creator.	它具有尊重创造者的价值。
Now, if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right, if we can take them and incorporate them, maybe we could do a little trade.	现在，假如我们可以学到这些价值 从右翼那里获得哪怕一点点影响， 假如我们可以争取并加入他们， 也许我们可以做一点交易。
We learn those values on the Left, and maybe they'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the Right.	我们从左派学到这些价值， 也许他们将对医疗进行改革 或者对全球变暖进行立法等等。
Anyway, please join me in teaching these values.	无论如何，请和我一起 传播这些价值观。
Thank you very much.	非常感谢。
A few years ago, my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry.	几年前，我初次目睹了 房产建筑工业的阴暗面
In 2006, young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.	2006年，几个年轻的卡塔尔学生 带我去探访了移民工人的住所
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.	自从那时起，我就开始密切关注建筑工人的权益的相关问题
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.	在过去的6个月中，阿联酋多达300座在建的摩天大厦 被迫暂停建造或取消
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.	在关于这些楼宇的头条新闻的背后， 是一个个往往被遗忘的建筑工人的命运
1.1 million of them.	足足有110万之多
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home.	主要来自于印度，巴基斯坦，斯里兰卡， 的这些工人们，常常承担着失去一切的风险 在挣钱养活他们远在故乡的家人们
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.	他们得付给约合几千美元的中介费才能到那里工作
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water, no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.	然而当他们到达目的地的，却发现自己身处劳工营，没有饮水， 没有空调，然后自己的护照又被扣走
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities, 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector, and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.	我们不难就这些情况指责那些当地官员和权力机关 可百分之九十九的劳工都是被私有产业所雇佣的 因此我们自己也同样负有责任。
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged, but the numbers are simply overwhelming.	一些例如阿联酋安建的团体开始纷纷出现 但是问题的数量确实惊人
In August 2008, UAE public officials noted that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.	2008年8月的时候 阿联酋的官方表明 全国1098个劳工营中，百分之四十 都违反了最低健康及火灾安全标准
And last summer, more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages, for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.	去年夏天，超过一万名劳工 一同抗议工资的拖欠 糟糕的食物和短缺的住房。
And then the financial collapse happened.	继而随着金融世界的崩盘，
When the contractors have gone bust, as they've been overleveraged like everyone else, the difference is everything goes missing, documentation, passports, and tickets home for these workers.	包工头也纷纷的破产了 这些工人像所有人一样，被过度的压榨 但区别在于他们失去了一切 文件，护照 归程的车票
Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.	现在呢，这一刻，数以千计的劳工们被无情的抛弃
There is no way back home.	没有办法回家
And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.	此外还没有办法证明他们当初合法入境
These are the boom-and-bust refugees.	这些就是那兴衰背后的难民
The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sights every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations?	我们所要提出的问题是：作为房建的专业人士， 无论你是建筑师，工程师，或是开发商 如果你知道这些状况的发生 就像我们每周去工地查看时一样， 你会自满自足，并间接地 去违背人权吗？
So let's forget your environmental footprint.	那么让我们暂时忘却你的环境足迹
Let's think about your ethical footprint.	转而关注你的道义足迹
What good is it to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex, when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best?	建造一个零炭平衡，能耗率高的建筑结构的同时 创造这个奇迹的的劳动力， 却受到极为不符道义的对待， 又有什么实在意义呢
Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.	最近有人说我选择了崇高的方式
But, quite frankly, on this issue, there is no other road.	但是坦白的讲，在这个问题上 实在是没有其他的方式了
So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.	所以让我们不要忘记是那一群体在为这次金融世界的坍塌来埋单
And that as we worry about our next job in the office, the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.	当我们还在担心自己的下一份工作何去何从的时候 我们如何选择挽留自己劳工的最佳途径
Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.	也让我们不要忘记这些拼了性命在工作的人们
Thank you.	谢谢大家
Let me tell you a story.	我来给大家讲个故事。
It's my first year as a new high school science teacher, and I'm so eager.	我成为高中理科老师的第一年， 我非常的积极。
I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.	非常的兴奋，我全身心的投入到我的教学工作中。
But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything.	但是我慢慢的认识到一个可怕的现实 我的学生可能什么都学不到。
This happens one day: I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology: viruses and how they attack.	有一天， 我安排学生们阅读课本的一个章节， 这个章节讲的是我在生物学中最喜欢的主题—— 病毒以及其攻击原理。
And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them, and I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool?"	我很兴奋能够跟他们讨论这个内容 我走进课堂，问：有没有人能阐述一下本章主要内容， 并解释病毒为什么这么酷？
There's silence.	现场一片寂静。
Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye, and she says, "The reading sucked."	终于，我最中意的学生，她看着我的眼睛， 说道，教材太恶心了
And then she clarified. She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.	然后她澄清道：我的意思是 我不是说内容恶心，我是说我根本看不懂。
It's boring.	太无聊了。
Um, who cares, and it sucks."	嗯，管他呢，就是恶心。
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now, and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat, that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook, but not one of them really understood the main ideas.	教室里一下子 充满了赞同的笑声。 我意识到班上所有的学生都是一样的感觉。 他们或许做了笔记，死记硬背了教材中的定义， 但没有一个人真正理解了其中意义。
Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool, why it's so important.	没有一个人能告诉我为什么这东西有意思， 为什么它很重要。
I'm totally clueless.	我完全迷茫了。
I have no idea what to do next.	我不知道接下去要做什么。
So the only thing I can think of is say, "Listen. Let me tell you a story.	我想到唯一可以做的是说， 听着，我来给大家讲个故事。
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses.	故事的主角是细菌和病毒。
The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope, and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick.	 你们可能对细菌和病毒并不陌生， 因为它们会让我们生病。
But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick."	但很多人都不知道的是，病毒 也可以让细菌生病。
Now, the story that I start telling my kids, it starts out like a horror story.	而后，我开始给学生们讲故事。 故事的开头有点恐怖。
Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium.	很久很久以前，有一个快乐的小细菌。
Don't get too attached to him.	别太投入了。
Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere, and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.	他可能正在你的胃里， 或是在一些变质的食物里游荡。 突然之间，他开始感觉不大对劲了。
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch, and then things get really horrible, as his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus coming out from his insides.	可能他午饭吃坏肚子了， 然后事情变得非常的可怕 它的皮肤裂开了，它看到一个病毒 从他体内钻了出来。
And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides.	更恐怖的事情是 它的身体爆炸了，成群的病毒 从细菌的体内喷涌了出来。
If -- Ouch is right! -- If you see this, and you're a bacterium, this is like your worst nightmare.	如果——哦，是的—— 如果你是一个细菌而你目睹了这一幕， 这将是你最可怕的噩梦。
But if you're a virus and you see this, you cross those little legs of yours and you think, "We rock."	但如果你是一只病毒，此情此景， 你可能就会悠闲地跷着二郎腿心想， 我们太牛了。
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.	因为病毒需要通过很巧妙的方式来感染细菌。
Here's what had to happen.	以下是具体过程：
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it.	一个病毒抓住一个细菌， 悄悄把自己的DNA注入细菌。
The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA.	接下来，病毒的DNA生成了一些物质 破坏了细菌原有的DNA。
And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA, the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses.	现在细菌的DNA已经被破坏了， 病毒的DNA控制了整个细胞。 然后病毒DNA开始复制更多的病毒。
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make.	因为，你看，DNA像是一个制造图纸 指示生命体制造指定的物质。
So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.	这就像原本是一个造车工厂 图纸被替换了，开始造杀人机器人了。
The workers still come the next day, they do their job, but they're following different instructions.	工人们第二天照旧来上班开工， 但他们执行的却是完全不同的指示。
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.	那么，将细菌的DNA更换为病毒的DNA 就使得细菌自身成为了一间制造病毒的工厂， 直到生产的病毒多到把细菌撑爆了为止。
But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria.	但这并非是病毒感染细菌的唯一途径。
Some are much more crafty.	有些方法更加精妙。
When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium, they do a little espionage.	当一个病毒特工感染一个细菌， 间谍活动随之展开。
Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell, but here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first.	这名潜行的特工不动声色地将其DNA送入细菌细胞， 但秘诀在于：它不会伤害细菌——至少现在不会。
Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA, and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell, waiting for instructions.	相反，它默默潜伏于细菌自身的DNA中， 犹如一枚定时炸弹， 静静地等待指令。
And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies, the babies also have the virus DNA in them.	有趣的是，接下来当细菌开始繁殖，有了自己的孩子时， 它的孩子也带有病毒的这段DNA。
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family, filled with virus sleeper cells.	于是当细菌繁衍成为一个大家族， 每一个家族成员都带有病毒的定时炸弹。
They're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM!	他们幸福地生活在一起，直到信号出现。 于是，砰！
-- all of the DNA pops out.	地一声，所有的潜伏DNA被唤醒了。
It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories, and they all burst, a huge, extended bacteria family, all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts, the viruses taking over the bacterium.	病毒DNA控制了这些细胞，将其变为制造病毒的工厂， 并让它们全部涨裂。 于是，熙熙攘攘的细菌大家族， 就这样被病毒由内而外全部消灭。 病毒完全接管了细菌体。
So now you understand how viruses can attack cells.	于是现在大家能理解病毒是如何攻击细胞的了。
There are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way, where the viruses go right in and take over the cells.	总共有两种途径：左边的我们称其为裂解性感染， 病毒一旦进入即掌控整个细胞。
On the [right] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses.	右边的我们称其为溶源性感染， 就是病毒特工闪亮登场的情境。
So this stuff is not that hard, right?	所以这些东西也不是那么难嘛，对吧？
And now all of you understand it.	现在大家都能够理解。
But if you've graduated from high school, I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before.	只要你高中毕了业， 我敢保证几乎每个人都看到过以上的东西。
But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind.	只是这些知识是以其他的形式呈现的， 并没有给你留下什么印象。
So when my students were first learning this, why did they hate it so much?	那么当我的学生们初次学习这些东西的时候， 为什么他们会这么痛恨这些？
Well, there were a couple of reasons.	当然，有若干原因：
First of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories.	其一，我可以保证他们的课本 可没有什么病毒特工或是恐怖小故事。
You know, in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness.	在科学界的交流中 通常有着对内容严肃性的执念。
It kills me. I'm not kidding.	我被严谨二字折磨死了，真的。
I used to work for an educational publisher, and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories or fun, engaging language, because then my work might not be viewed as "serious" and "scientific."	我曾在一家教育出版社供职， 作为一名撰稿人，我被告知永远不要用故事体 逗趣笑话或引人眼球的语言风格， 因为如果我用了的话，我的作品就不会被视为是 严肃的和科学的。
Right?	对吧？
I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science.	就好像上帝禁止学科学的人 找乐子一样。
So we have this field of science that's all about slime, and color changes.	所以我们的科学领域中充满了黏液 颜色变化等。
Check this out.	注意看这个。
And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have, explosions!	然后，当然，我们有优秀科学家必备的 爆炸！
But if a textbook seems too much fun, it's somehow unscientific.	但是如果教材太有意思了， 似乎就不科学了。
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.	另一个问题在于， 教材中使用的语言真的是无法理解。
If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier, we could start by saying something like, "These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium."	如果我们要总结我们之前讲的故事， 我们可以这么说： 病毒通过把自己的DNA送入细菌体内 来复制自己。
The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this: "Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium."	但如果要是写在课本里的语言，就会变成这样： 噬菌体病毒之复制 以病毒核酸向细菌体 之引入而开始。
That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.	这个很好，对13岁小孩来说很合适。
But here's the thing.	但是问题来了。
There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students, because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate.	在科学教育领域的 很多人会在看了这段话之后，说他们 不能这么教育学生， 因为这段话中的措辞并不完全准确。
For example, I told you that viruses have DNA.	比如，我之前告诉大家病毒有DNA。
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't.	好吧，很小一部分病毒是没有DNA，
They have something called RNA instead.	相对应地，他们体内有另一种称为RNA的物质。
So a professional science writer would circle that and say, "That has to go.	于是所谓专业的科学作者估计会把这处圈出来，说， 这不行
We have to change it to something much more technical."	得换成更严谨科学的表述。
And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation, they'd find fault with almost every word I've used, and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough, and they'd have to change everything that wasn't 100 percent perfect.	然后经过专业科学编辑团队 审阅了这段简单的解释之后 他们可能会发现我说的每句话都有毛病 而他们必须要改掉所有不严谨的地方 他们不得不改掉所有不是 百分百精确的事情
Then it would be accurate, but it would be completely impossible to understand.	现在或许是精确了 但是已经完全无法让人理解了
This is horrifying.	这太吓人了
You know, I keep talking about this idea of telling a story, and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision, where you can't just tell a story.	我一直在说通过讲故事进行教学 的想法 但是现在的科学课程教学是基于我称之为 精确性至上的教学法 这套方法不讲故事。
It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about, where you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day, and she was wearing these ugly jeans.	感觉讲故事的人很可怕，会把科学课程变成 传授我们尽人皆知的细碎知识， 就像是哦，一天我跟朋友吃饭， 她穿的牛仔裤不好看。
I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings, but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings, like, but I think — " and you're just like, "Oh my God.	我是说，他们不是真的牛仔裤，而是窄腿裤 但是，我想他们某种意义上更像是紧身裤 但是我想——你会类似反应天哪，
What is the point?"	到底想说什么？
Or even worse, science education is becoming like that guy who always says, "Actually."	或者更糟，科学教育变成了 一个总是说实际上的人。
Right?	不是么？
You want to be like, "Oh, dude, we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness."	想象一下，哦，伙计， 我们要在午夜起床然后 在黑夜中开车走100公里。
And that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles."	然后一个人说，实际上，是87.3公里哦
And you're like, "Actually, shut up!	然后你说，实际上，闭嘴！
I'm just trying to tell a story."	我只是想说一个故事。
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection.	好的故事需要关注的是情感的联系。
We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters.	我们需要说服我们的听众 我们说的话很重要。
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across.	而重要的是知道 忽略掉无关紧要的细节 重点才会得到突出。
I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said, and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth.	我记得建筑大师密斯·凡德罗说过， 我解释一下，当他说有时候 你必须通过谎言来传达真相
I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education.	我想这跟科学教育 有相通之处。
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science.	现在，最后， 我时常感到失望 人们会认为我是在鼓吹 科学的弱智化.
That's not true at all.	根本不是这样的。
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT, and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed, specific scientific communication between experts, but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds.	我现在是MIT的在读博士， 我完全理解细节的重要性 专家之间交流时细节尤其重要 但是在教13岁孩子的时候不是那么重要的
If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA, that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.	如果一个孩子觉得病毒都是有DNA的 不大可能因此毁掉了他们成为科学家的机会。
But if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this, that will ruin their chances of success.	但是如果一个孩子无法理解科学课程中的知识 并由于这些枯燥的东西而讨厌这门课程 这真的可能会毁掉他们成功的机会。
This needs to stop, and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems, and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.	这需要改变。 我希望这些改变来自于高层的机构 让他们能够意识到问题的存在 我祈求他们，祈求他们别再这么教学了。
But I think that's unlikely.	但是我觉得不太现实。
So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up.	还好我们很幸运的拥有互联网这样的资源 我们可以撇开这些管理机构，自底向上的 进行改变。
There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple, understandable ways.	网上相关的教程越来越多 他们都尝试用简单和直白的语言 来解释科学原理
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand.	我希望有一个维基百科一样的网站 解释你能想到的任何科学概念 用一种任何一个中学生都能够理解的语言和方式。
And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube.	而我自己把我的闲暇时间都投入到了 制作这些YouTube在线课程的事情上。
I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances, and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp.	我用中学舞蹈的古怪动作来类比 化学等价原理。 我用夏令营中男孩和女孩的故事来 解释燃料电池原理
The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in LOLcats, but nonetheless it's so appreciative, so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science.	我收到的反馈，经常包含拼写错误 经常包含各种聊天缩写 但是撇开这些 我很感激这些评论 让我知道我的方法是正确的 我们就应该这样传授科学知识
There's still so much work left to be done, though, and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me.	虽然还有很多很多的工作要做 如果你也有参与科学工作 我请求你加入我的行动。
Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever, but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.	录段视频，写篇博客，怎么都行， 但是请抛开严谨性，抛开术语口号。
Make me laugh. Make me care.	逗观众开心，吸引他们注意。
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point.	抛开这些没人关心的恼人的细节 直击重点。
How should you start?	如何开场？
Why don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"?	为什么不尝试说：来，我给你讲个故事
Thank you.	谢谢。
What's happening to the climate?	气候到底发生了什么？
It is unbelievably bad.	糟糕地让人难以置信。
This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic, which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years.	显然，这是我们所熟悉的北极美景， 而这将很快消失不见， 可能只是三、四或五年之后。
Very, very, very scary.	非常！非常！非常可怕！
So we all look at what we can do.	所以我们都在思考着我们对此能够做些什么。
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2, 52 percent are tied to buildings.	当我们看到世界范围内二氧化碳的来源图时， 52%与建筑物有关。
Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.	说来有趣，只有9%来自汽车。
So we ran off to a sushi bar.	有次我们来到了某个寿司吧。
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.	而在这个寿司吧中我们有了一个伟大的想法。
And it was something called EcoRock.	它被命名为生态石。
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.	我们说自己能够重新设计具有115年历史的 石膏墙体工艺，正是它 每年产生着200亿磅的二氧化碳。
So it was a big idea.	因此这是一个伟大的想法。
We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent, which is exactly what we've done.	我们希望在这个数字的基础上降低80%。 这正是我们所完成的。
We started R&amp;D in 2006.	我们于2006年开始进行研发。
Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing.	并决定使用从水泥和 钢铁制造生产中所提取的可回收组分。
There is the inside of our lab.	这是我们的实验室。
We haven't shown this before.	之前并没有向外展示过。
But our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.	但是我们的成员们不得不尝试5000种 不同的配方以找到最佳配方并满足我们的目标。
And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.	他们真的非常非常非常努力地工作。
So then we went forward and built our production line in China.	然后我们进一步在中国建设了生产线。
We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately.	遗憾地是我们将不会在美国建立这样的生产线。
We did the line install over the summer.	整个夏天我们都忙于生产线的安装。
We started right there, with absolutely nothing.	我们就是从那里开始，从无到有。
You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line, not made using gypsum at all.	您将会第一次看到全新的墙体生产线 完全不使用石膏。
That's the finished production line there.	那是我们所完成的生产线。
We got our first panel out on December third.	并在12月3日生产出第一块墙板。
That is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically.	这是原料浆正被倒在纸板上。

Obviously very, very excited.	很明显他非常非常兴奋。
But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.	这将会对环境造成巨大的影响。
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony, leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.	几周之后我们举行了盛大的签字仪式，大家都在这第一块墙板上签上自己的名字。 希望全世界的人可以开始使用这些产品。
And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.	这个产品得到了C2C标志认证。
We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.	我们最近还以墙体材料的改良发明 获得《科技新时代》杂志所评选的年度绿色产品奖。
Thank you.	谢谢，谢谢！
So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house.	8000加仑的气体 相当于建造一座房屋。
You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.	也许你不太清楚，这相当于开车绕地球六圈。
We must change everything.	我们必须改变一切。
Look around the room: chairs, wood, everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.	看看我们的房间，椅子，木材。

Thank you so much.	感谢大家的倾听。
Hi.	大家好！
I am an architect.	我是一位建筑设计师。
I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube, and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes.	我是世界上唯一一位以纸为建筑材料的 建筑师，就比如用这样的硬纸管。 这是我第一个用纸管 举办的展览。
1986, much, much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues, I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure.	早在1986年，关于生态和环境问题的 讨论还远远没有开始的时候 我刚刚开始测试纸筒 以便将其作为一种建筑结构使用
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building, but this is much stronger than I expected, and also it's very easy to waterproof, and also, because it's industrial material, it's also possible to fireproof.	测试新的建筑材料过程很复杂， 但纸管比我想象的要坚实许多， 而且进行防水处理也很容易， 加上纸是工业材料，所以 进行防火处理也是可能的，
Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.	接着在1990年，我搭建了这个临时的建筑结构。
This is the first temporary building made out of paper.	这是第一座纸制的临时性建筑。
There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters], there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.	由330个直径为55厘米的纸筒组成， 只有12个纸筒的直径有120厘米， 或者说四英尺宽。
As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.	从照片上可以看到，里面是厕所。
In case you're finished with toilet paper, you can tear off the inside of the wall.	万一卫生纸用完了， 可以从墙上撕点下来。
So it's very useful.	所以说它很实用。
Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.	2000年，德国举办了一次盛大的世博会。
I was asked to design the building, because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.	我受邀设计世博会日本馆。 因为环境问题是这次世博会的主题，
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes, recyclable paper.	所以就选定了我来用纸筒建展览馆， 可反复利用的纸。
My goal was when the building was demolished, because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste, so my building has to be reused or recycled.	 因为每个国家都建许多展览馆， 但半年以后，剩下的是一大堆工业废品， 因此，我所建的必须能够再利用或回收利用。
After, the building was recycled.	世博会后，这座建筑就被回收利用了。
So that was the goal of my design.	这就是我设计的目标。
Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz.	然后，我很幸运地赢得比赛 进而取得了在法国梅茨城建造蓬皮杜中心 新馆的机会。
Because I was so poor, I wanted to rent an office in Paris, but I couldn't afford it, so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves.	因为我当时很穷， 本想在巴黎租一个办公室， 却又租不起， 所以我决定带我的学生到巴黎 在蓬皮中心的楼顶搭建我们的办公室 我们自己建。
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office.	于是我们就带着纸筒和木质连接 建成了这35米长的办公室。
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.	我们在那里待了六年，不用付任何房租
Thank you.	谢谢。
I had one big problem.	当时我有个不小的问题。
Because we were part of the exhibition, even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.	因为我们也是展会的一部分， 即便是我的朋友要见我，他们也要买票才能见到我。
That was the problem.	问题就在这儿。
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.	然后我完成了梅兹蓬皮中心的建造。
It's a very popular museum now, and I created a big monument for the government.	中心现已成为非常受欢迎的博物馆， 我还为政府建造了一个庞大的纪念碑。
But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect, because we are not helping, we are not working for society, but we are working for privileged people, rich people, government, developers.	但我当时对自己的建筑师职业 却感到很失望， 因为我们并不是在帮助社会，为民众工作， 而是为有权势的人工作， 富人、政府、开发商。
They have money and power.	他们有钱有权。
Those are invisible.	财富和权力是无形的。
So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture.	所以他们就通过雇用我们来建造宏伟的建筑 来彰显他们的权力和财富。
That is our profession, even historically it's the same, even now we are doing the same.	这就是我们的职业，甚至在历史上也是如此， 直到现在我们还在做着同样的事。
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society, even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters.	因此我对于我们并不是为社会大众服务而感到非常失落， 即使有这么多的人 因为自然灾害流离失所。
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.	但我必须要说的是罪魁祸首并不是自然灾害。
For example, earthquakes never kill people, but collapse of the buildings kill people.	打个比方，地震从来都不夺人性命， 建筑倒塌才是致死原因。
That's the responsibility of architects.	这是建筑师的责任。
Then people need some temporary housing, but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people.	人们需要一个临时住房时， 却没有搭建这些临时住房的建筑师 因为我们都忙着为有权势的人工作。
So I thought, even as architects, we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.	所以，我想，作为建筑师， 我们也可以参与临时住房的重建。
We can make it better.	我们可以对其进行改善。
So that is why I started working in disaster areas.	因此我开始在灾难地区工作。
1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.	1994年非洲卢旺达发生了一场大灾难。
Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.	胡图族和图西族两个部落互相残杀。
Over two million people became refugees.	两百多万人变为难民。
But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp organized by the U.N.	但当我看到由联合国安排的帐篷和难民营时， 我大吃一惊。
They're so poor, and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season, In the shelters built by the U.N., they were just providing a plastic sheet, and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.	帐篷都很破旧，雨季期间 批着毛毯也十分的冷， 联合国搭建的帐篷中， 只提供了一张塑料垫子， 而难民不得不去砍树，就像这样。
But over two million people cut trees.	但两百多万人去砍树，
It just became big, heavy deforestation and an environmental problem.	就演变成了大片的严重的森林采伐 并造成了环境问题。
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.	正因如此，联合国就开始提供铝制的管子和棚屋。
Very expensive, they throw them out for money, then cutting trees again.	很贵，于是就被当地人拿去换钱了， 然后又砍起树来。
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong, but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.	于是，我提出了利用这些再生纸管 来改善现状的想法 因为纸管便宜又坚实。 但我的预算只有每个50美元。
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites, so on.	我们就搭建了50个用来监控测试 其耐用性，抗湿和防白蚁能力等等。
And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan, we had a big earthquake.	接着一年后，1995年，日本的神户， 发生了一起大地震。
Nearly 7,000 people were killed, and the city like this Nagata district, all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.	将近七千人死亡， 而整座城就像这长田区一样， 都在地震后的大火中焚烧着。
And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church -- all the building was totally destroyed.	我发现有很多越南来的难民 聚集在一个天主教教堂旁边，忍受着痛苦。 整座教堂全部烧毁。
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests, "Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"	我就到那里去并向神父提出， 我们何不用纸筒重建教堂呢？
And he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?	他叫道，哦天哪，你疯了么？
After a fire, what are you proposing?"	火灾刚过啊，你这是在说什么啊？
So he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.	所以他一直都不信任我，不过我没有放弃。
I started commuting to Kobe, and I met the society of Vietnamese people.	我开始常去神户， 接触了越南人的社区。
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park.	他们就这样住在一个公园，在破烂的 塑料帐篷中。
So I proposed to rebuild.	于是我提议重建（住所）并筹集了资金。
I made a paper tube shelter for them, and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish, I used beer crates as a foundation.	 为了方便学生搭建 与拆除， 我使用啤酒箱作为地基。
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose, because at that time, the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red, which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.	我请麒麟啤酒公司来提议， 因为当时朝日啤酒 生产的啤酒箱是红色的， 与纸筒的颜色不相称。
The color coordination is very important.	颜色协调是非常重要的。
And also I still remember, we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate, but it came empty.	我还记得当时我们还期待着塑料 啤酒箱中还有啤酒可以喝， 但送来的啤酒箱是空的。
So I remember it was so disappointing.	我记得大家都很失望。
So during the summer with my students, we built over 50 units of the shelters.	整个夏天我和我的学生， 搭建了50个这样的帐篷。
Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.	最后神父终于相信了我，允许我重建教堂。
He said, "As long as you collect money by yourself, bring your students to build, you can do it."	他说，只要你自己集资， 带你的学生来建，就行。
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.	于是我们花了五个星期的时间重建了这座教堂。
It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.	原先计划这座教堂会在那里保存三年， 但因为人们的厚爱，这座教堂矗立在那里整整十年
Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake, and we proposed to donate this church, so we dismantled them, we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.	然后，台湾发生了一场大地震， 我们提议捐出这座教堂， 于是我们就拆解下纸管， 我们把纸管送去那里由志愿者搭建。
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.	这座教堂就长驻台湾，成为了一个永久教堂直至今日。
So this building became a permanent building.	于是这座建筑就变成了一座永久的建筑。
Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?	而后我就想，什么是永久的，而什么又是临时性的建筑？
Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it.	即使是一个用纸搭建的建筑， 只要人们喜欢，它就可以变成永恒的。
Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money.	即使是一个混凝土建筑，如果它是为了赚钱而建的， 那也可以在瞬间烟消云散。
In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake, I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.	1999年，土耳其发生了大地震。 我去那里利用当地的材料搭建了一个避难所。

In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.	2009年，意大利的拉奎拉也发生大地震。
And this is a very interesting photo: former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso -- you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.	这是一张很有趣的照片： 前任总理贝卢斯科尼与 日本前前前前任首相麻生先生 大家都知道我们的首相是年年换的。

Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake, but it's impossible to fly over, so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country, to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.	2010年，海地发生大地震， 但是没有直达那里的飞机， 就是我就去了邻国圣多明各， 然后与那里当地的学生 开6个小时的车到达海地 用当地的纸筒搭建了50个避难所。
This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.	这是两年前在日本，日本的北部所是发生的事。
After the earthquake and tsunami, people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.	地震和海啸过后， 人们要疏散到一个像体育馆的地方
But look at this. There's no privacy.	但可以看出，那里丝毫没有隐私。
People suffer mentally and physically.	人们身心都在煎熬。
So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes, just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.	于是我们就去那里建隔板。 所有这些学生志愿者带着纸筒去了， 就是一个很简单用纸管搭成的框架外加窗帘构成的避难所
However, some of the facility authority doesn't want us to do it, because, they said, simply, it's become more difficult to control them.	可是，设施部门的一些人 不想我们做这件事，因为他们说 这样一来控制这些人就变得更困难。
But it's really necessary to do it.	但是，事实证明立隔板是有必要的。
They don't have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one.	他们没有足够的平地建设 像这样的普通公用单层住房。
Look at this.	看看这个，甚至公民政府的临时性住房 构建也如此简陋。
Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing, so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking, so I thought, we have to make multi-story building because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.	 这样的拥挤、杂乱，没有储藏处，什么都没有，还漏水， 于是我想， 我们必须建多层楼的房子（才能解决） 没有土地，住着又非常不舒服
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.	所以我就边搭建隔板，边向市长提议
Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi.	最后我在宫城县的女川村遇到一个非常好的 市长。
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].	他要我在棒球场上搭建三层楼的住房。
I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable, within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same, but much more comfortable.	我利用了海运集装箱 并且，学生们也帮助我们作了 所有的建筑家具， 把一切布置得很舒适 花费也保持在政府预算之内 房子的面积一模一样， 但舒适许多。

Thank you very much.	非常感谢大家。
I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years.	在接下来的18分钟里，我要向你们讲述 过去六百万年内发生的事情。
All right.	开始吧。
We all have come from a long way, here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa, which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.	我们都经历了漫长的历程， 在非洲这里，在非洲这一地区相聚， 这里是我们90%的进化过程的发生之地。
And I say that not because I am African, but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors, upright walking traces, even the first technologies in the form of stone tools.	我这么说的原因不是因为我是个非洲人， 而是因为在非洲，你可以找到 关于人类祖先的最早证据、直立行走的痕迹、 甚至是最早的科技──石器。
So we all are Africans, and welcome home.	所以我们都是非洲人。欢迎你们回家。
All right.	好的。
I'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define man's place in nature and explore what makes us human.	我是一名古人类学家，我的职责是去定义 人类在大自然中的地位，并且探究人类的本质，
And today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered, to tell you a story of all of us.	今天我就要通过塞拉姆──至今发现的最远古的小孩── 来讲述一个关于我们所有人的故事。
Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl who lived and died 3.3 million years ago.	塞拉姆是我们所拥有的最完整的三岁小女孩的骨骼， 她生活在330万年前。
She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.	她属于南方古猿阿法种，
You don't need to remember that.	你不需要记住这个。
That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.	那也是露西的种族，是由我的研究小组 在2000年的12月份在一个叫做Dikika的地方发现的。
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.	是在埃塞俄比亚的东北部。
And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.	塞拉姆在很多埃塞俄比亚语言中都代表着和平。
We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.	我们选用了这个名字来庆祝这一区域和这个星球上的和平。
And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance, I think.	这些著名杂志都用其作为头版头条， 这一点就可以告诉你其重要性了。
After I was invited by TED, I did some digging, because that's what we do, to know about my host.	在受到TED的邀请之后，我决定做一点钻研（一词双意：digging既指研究，又指挖掘。） 来进一步了解TED，毕竟我是干这一行的。
You don't just jump into an invitation.	不能茫然地接受邀请。
And I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.	通过我的研究，我发现最早的科技 是260万年前的石器，
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.	最早的娱乐来自35000年前的笛子，
And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old -- beads.	而最早的设计则有75000年的历史──是珠子。
And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.	你也可以用同样的办法追溯你的基因的历史。
And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.	而对现存的人类和猩猩的研究 告诉我们大概在7百万年前，人类和猩猩分道扬镳， 至今这两个物种仍然有98%的共同基因。
I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry.	我认为，了解这些为我们对祖先的研究 提供了非常有用的背景资料。
However, DNA analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end, telling us nothing about what happened in the middle.	不过，这些研究只告诉了我们开始和结局， 却没有告诉 其中都经历了什么。
So, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence, the fossil evidence, to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development.	而对于我们古人类学家而言，我们的工作就是找到确凿的证据， 化石证据，来填补其中的空白， 呈现发展过程中的各个阶段。
Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about -- -- it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times, and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.	只有做到这一点之后，你才可以讨论... 只有做到这一点之后，你才可以讨论 在不同时期我们的相貌和我们的行为， 以及这些喜好、相貌和行为如何随着时间的流逝而变化，
That then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today.	那时这就可以给我们一个 探索这样的生命机制， 正是这些机制和力量逐渐 把我们变成今天这个样子。
But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.	但是找到确凿的证据是一件非常复杂的任务。
It's a systematic and scientific approach, which takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.	这是一个系统和科学方法， 来带你去很遥远、炎热、危险并常常无法进入的地方。
Just to give you an example, when I went to Dikika, where Selam was found, in '99 -- and it's about 500 kilometers from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.	比如，当我们去Dikika， 也就是塞勒姆99年被发现的地方，那里离Addis Ababa 埃塞俄比亚的首都约有500公里。
It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500, but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.	500公里的前470公里只花了我们7小时的时间， 但其后的30个小时足足花了我们整整4个小时。
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.	在当地人的帮助之下，使用锹和镐，我开辟了了一条路。
I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.	我算是开车到这个地方的第一个人。
When you get there, this is what you see, and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.	当你到那儿的时候，这就是你所看到的， 这片区域的广袤让你感到自身的无助和脆弱。
And once you make it there, the big question is where to start.	一旦你到了那里，最大的问题就是从哪里开始。
And you find nothing for years and years.	然后你年复一年，什么也找不到。
When I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites, it's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.	当我去这样的古人类学研究现场时， 就像是去一家游乐园，一家灭绝的游乐园。
But what you find are not the human remains, such as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.	但是你找到的并不是在通常意义上存在的人类， 就像是塞勒姆和露西。
You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.	你找到的是大象，犀牛，猴子，野猪等等。
But you could ask, how could these large mammals live in this desert environment?	但你可能会问，这样大型的动物 如何能够生存在这样的沙漠环境中？
Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today.	他们当然不能，但我已经告诉你的是 这个环境及这个地区的承载能力已经与我们今天 的情况产生了急剧的变化。
A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.	我们可以从这里学到一堂非常重要的生态课程。
Anyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.	不管怎样，当我们到了那里，它就是个游乐场，就像我说的那样，一个灭绝的游乐场。
And our ancestors lived in that game park, but were just the minorities.	而且我们的祖先也生活在那个游乐场， 但我们只是少数派。
They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.	他们并不像智人那样 成功生存而且广泛分布。
To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity, I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here, and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.	再给你们举一个例子，一些关于他们稀缺性的奇闻轶事， 我每年都要去这个地方，去做实地调查， 当然，我的助手帮助我去做这些调查。
They would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for."	他们会找到一块骨头然后告诉我，这就是你要找的。
I would say, "No, that's an elephant."	我会说，不，这是一块大象的骨头。
"That's a pig," etc.	再一次，另外一块——这是一只猴子的骨头，那是一只野猪的骨头，等等。
So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.	因此，我的一位从未上过学的助手，对我说，听着，Zeray。
You either don't know what you're looking for, or you're looking in the wrong place," he said.	你或者不知道你要找什么， 也不知道你是不是找对地方了，他说。
And I said, "Why?"	然后我说，为什么？
"Because there were elephants and lions, and the people were scared and went somewhere else.	因为这里有大象和狮子， 所以人类会恐惧，就搬到其他地方去了。
Let's go somewhere else."	我们去别的地方吧。
Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.	好吧，他非常疲惫，而且这件事真的很让人倦怠。
It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam, and you see the face here covered by sandstone.	找到了塞勒姆，经过如此艰苦的工作和令人沮丧的岁月后 你可以看到这里被砂岩覆盖的面孔。
And here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block, because she was buried by a river.	这里实际上是嵌在一块砂岩中的 脊柱和整个躯体， 因为她被一条河流所埋葬。
What you have here seems to be nothing, but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human.	你现在所拥有的貌似什么都不是， 但包含了大量不可思议的科学讯息， 能够帮助我们了解是什么让我们成为人类。
This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology, an amazing piece of our long, long history.	这是古人类学历史上找到的最早和 最年少的人类祖先—— 这段历史是我们长久历史中最叹为观止的片段。
There were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures, that's why I am not in.	这是我和其他三个人，我正在拍照， 所以我不在镜头中。
How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand, but you are in the middle of nowhere?	如果你是我，你的手中捧着意义非凡的东西，但你却不是中心或焦点， 你会怎么想？
The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement, of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility, of making sure everything is safe.	我的感觉就是，非常深切的快乐和激动， 当然随之而来的是巨大的责任感， 那种要确保所有事都安全。
Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning, preparation and description, which was very long, as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide.	这是一块化石的特写， 它经过了5年的清理、准备和修饰——那时间非常长， 而且我需要把骨头从砂岩块中取出来 那块砂岩我在前一张片子里给大家演示了。
It took five years.	这花费了5年。
In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years, but the labor was very long.	在某种程度下，这就像是这个孩子在330万年之后的第二次重生， 但是劳动的时间很长。
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.	这里是一个完整的——这是一块小骨头。
And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism, who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.	中间这个是埃塞俄比亚的旅游部长， 当我在埃塞俄比亚的国家博物馆工作的时候，他造访了那里。
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child, because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child, even a minister.	你可以看到我很担心，试图保护我的孩子， 因为你不会把那样的孩子留给任何人， 即使是一个部长。
So then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.	所以，一旦你那样做了，下一步就是弄明白那样的行为是什么意思。
Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.	一旦工作完成了，就有进行比较的可能性了。
We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs, the foot, and some features clearly showed that she walked upright, and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.	我们能够告诉大家的是她属于 人类的大家庭，因为她的腿、脚、 和其他一些特征很明显的显示了她直立行走， 而直立行走是人类的专属标志。
But in addition, if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here, you see that you have vertical forehead.	不过另外，如果你你把这个头骨与 一个对等年龄的黑猩猩以及这里的小布什相比， 你们可以看到有垂直的额头，
And you see that in humans, because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.	这是在人类中，由于所谓的 大脑前叶的发展所造成的——
You don't see that in chimpanzees, and you don't see this very projecting canine.	而你在黑猩猩的身上看不到这一点， 而且你也看不到这样突出的犬齿。
So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course, you do detailed analysis, and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species, known as Australopithecus afarensis.	所以她属于我们这一族谱，当然，随着我们 进行了详细的分析，我们现在知道 她属于露西一族，这一族 被称做阿法南方古猿。
The next exciting question is, girl or boy?	下一个令人激动的问题是女孩还是男孩，
And how old was she when she died?	当她死亡的时候有多大？
You can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth.	你可以根据牙齿的大小判断 一个人的性别。
How?	怎么做到？
You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism, which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females.	大家知道，在灵长类动物中，有一种现象 叫做两性异型，简单来讲就是 男性要比女性要大一些， 男性的牙齿要比女性更大。
But to do that, you need the permanent dentition, which you don't see here, because what you have here are the baby teeth.	不过要做到那一点，你需要找到恒齿， 我们在这里看不到，因为我们所有的是 婴儿的牙齿。
But using the CT scanning technology, which is normally used for medical purposes, you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still-growing adult teeth here.	但使用CT扫描技术， 即常用于医学目的的那种—— 你可以深入口腔，获取那些既可以显示婴儿牙齿 又可以显示正在生长的成人牙齿 的美丽图像。
So when you measure those teeth, it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth.	所以当我们测量这些牙齿时， 就这么小的犬齿来看，很明显 她是个女孩。
And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.	要想知道她死时有多少岁，你能够做的 就是去做一个可靠的估计，你要知道形成这个牙齿要花多长时间， 我们的答案就是三岁。
So, this girl died when she was about three, 3.3 million years ago.	因此这个女孩在约三岁时夭折了， 距今330万年。
So, with all that information, the big question is -- what do we actually -- what does she tell us?	因此有了这么多信息，最大的问题就是—— 我们实际上——她告诉了我们什么事情？
To answer this question, we can phrase another question.	要回答这个问题，我们可以引用另一个问题——
What do we actually know about our ancestors?	关于我们的祖先我们究竟了解多少？
We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved, how they walked around, and how they lived and grew up.	我们想了解他们长相如何，行为如何， 如何行走， 以及它们如何生活和成长。
And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included: first, this skeleton documents, for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.	你可以从这具骨骼中找到的答案已经 囊括了以上的疑问——首先，这句骨骼首次记录了 距今300万年前的孤儿长什么样儿。
And second, she tells us that she walked upright, but had some adaptation for tree climbing.	其次，她告诉了我们她是直立行走的， 不过仍具有一些爬树的适应性
And more interesting, however, is the brain in this child was still growing.	更令人觉得有趣的是，然而， 这个孩子的大脑仍然在成长。
At age three, if you have a still-growing brain, it's a human behavior.	三岁时，如果你的大脑还在成长， 这就属于人类的特征了。
In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.	三岁的黑猩猩，其大脑已经90%成型。
That's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth -- faster than us, anyway.	这正是它们在出生以后很快就能适应环境 的原因——无论怎样，适应的比我们快。
But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.	反观人类，我们则继续进行脑部发育。
That's why we need care from our parents.	这也是我们为何需要父母照顾的原因。
But that care means also you learn.	不过这种照看意味着你还在不断学习成长。
You spend more time with your parents.	你跟父母在一起的时间更长。
And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood, which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents.	这是人类的典型特点，它叫做童年， 即人类儿童对其家庭或父母的 更长久的依赖。
So, the still-growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood, which requires an incredible social organization, a very complex social organization, emerged over three million years ago.	所以这个孩子正在成长的大脑 告诉我们她的童年开始于 300多万年前，而这需要 一个不可思议的社会组织， 一个非常复杂的社会组织。
So, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history, Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human.	因此在我们进化历史的顶端， 塞勒姆将我们联合起来，给予我们之所以为人的 特殊依据。
But not everything was human, and I will give you a very exciting example.	不过并不是所有的特征都是人类，我会给你展示 一个非常令人激动的例证。
This is called the hyoid bone.	这个叫做舌骨。
It's a bone which is right here.	它就是长在这里的骨头。
It supports your tongue from behind.	它从后部支撑着你的舌头。
It's, in a way, your voice box.	在某种意义上，它是你的音箱。
It determines the type of voice you produce.	它决定了你发出的声音类型。
It was not known in the fossil record, and we have it in this skeleton.	在化石记录里，它并不出名， 我们在这具骨骼上发现了它。
When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.	当我们对这块骨头进行分析时，很明显发现， 它非常像黑猩猩。
So if you were there 3.3 million years ago, to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother, she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.	因此，如果你处于330万年前， 听这个女孩哭喊着找妈妈时， 她听起来会更像黑猩猩而非人类。
Maybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.	可能你在想，那么你看到了猿类的特征，人类的特征，猿类的特征。
What does that tell us?"	它到底对我们意味着什么？
You know, that is very exciting for us, because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively, and that evolution is in the making.	你要知道，那对我们来说实在激动人心， 因为它说明了事物是缓慢且不断前进的变化着的， 进化正在发生。
To summarize the significance of this fossil, we can say the following.	来总结一下这个化石的重要性， 我们可以谈到以下几点。
Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.	迄今为止，我们拥有的关于我们祖先的知识 基本上来自于成年人的化石，因为 婴儿的化石是缺失的。
They don't preserve well, as you know.	正如你们所知道的，他们不易保存完好。
So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors, on how they looked like, how they behaved, was kind of biased toward adults.	所以我们拥有的关于我们祖先 长相如何，行为如何的知识， 只是基于成人的片面观点。
Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies, the children, and he goes back and reports.	想象一下有人从火星而来， 他的工作就是记录并报告统治着地球的 人类物种，而我们把所有婴儿、儿童都藏起来了， 接着他便回去复命。
Can you imagine how much biased his report would be?	你可以想象这个报告将有多大的偏差么？
That's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children, so I think the new fossil fixes this problem.	这就是在缺少儿童化石的情况下，我们 到目前为止在做的工作， 因此我认为这些新化石解决了这个问题。
So, I think the most important question at the end is, what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general?	所以我觉得最终最重要的问题是， 从更普遍的意义上来讲，我们实际上从这样的标本 和我们的历史中学到了什么？
Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human, you know, the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 -- they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications that we, Homo sapiens, have today.	当然，除了提取到这么大量的科学信息 来证明我们之所以成为人类， 很多存在于过去600万年的远古人类祖先—— 至少有10个——他们并不具备这些 我们智人今天所拥有的知识、 技术和方法。
But if this species, ancient species, would travel in time and see us today, they would very much be very proud of their legacy, because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe.	不过如果这个物种，远古的物种， 会通过时间旅行来看望今天的我们， 他们将会为他们所留的遗产而倍感骄傲， 因为他们是当前宇宙中最成功 物种的祖先。
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy, but they did great.	他们可能并不知道他们未来的遗产， 不过他们确实很伟大。
Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.	现在问题是，我们今天这些智人 正担负着决定我们的星球未来的责任，或者有可能责任更大。
So the question is, are we up to the challenge?	所以问题是，我们准备好去挑战了么？
And can we really do better than these primitive, small-brained ancestors?	我们真的能比这些先驱者、脑容量小的祖先 做得更好么？
Among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.	我们的物种今日所面临的最有挑战性的问题是 非洲长期存在的问题。
Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people to talk about this.	无需去列举，已经有很多智者 讨论过这些。
Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.	然而，我认为，我们有两种选择。
One is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa, carrying guns, that depends on other people forever, or to promote an Africa which is confident, peaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time.	一是维持一个贫穷、病痛、哭泣的非洲—— 手握武器——永远依赖着他人， 或是推动一个更加自信、 和平、独立，但同时能够认识到它自身面临的巨大问题和 巨大价值的非洲。
I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.	我支持第二种选择，而且我确信我们大多数人是这样想的。
And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.	关键是推动起一个对非洲更加积极的非洲精神。
That's because we Africans concentrate -- I am from Ethiopia, by the way -- we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere, or from outside.	因为我们非洲关注于—— 顺便说一下，我来自埃塞俄比亚—— 我们太关注于别人怎么 看我们和理解我们。
I think it's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves.	我认为重要的是我们应以一个更积极的态度 来看待我们自己。
That's what I call positive African attitude.	这就是我所说的非洲——积极的非洲精神。
So finally, I would like to say, so let's help Africa walk upright and forward, then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.	最后，我想说， 就让我们帮助非洲站起来，向前走—— 那时，作为同一个物种，我们都会为我们留给未来的遗产而骄傲。
Thank you.	谢谢。
When we park in a big parking lot, how do we remember where we parked our car?	当我们在大型停车场停车后， 如何回忆起将车停在了哪个车位呢？
Here's the problem facing Homer.	这就是现在困扰荷马的问题。
And we're going to try to understand what's happening in his brain.	接下来我们将尝试了解 此时他脑中正开展何种运动。
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow, which is the organ of memory.	我们先着眼于大脑海马区，即黄色的区域 这是我们的记忆器官。
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's, you can't remember things including where you parked your car.	如果海马区出现损伤,像老年痴呆症患者一样, 你将丧失记忆力，乃至记不起将车停在了何处。
It's named after Latin for "seahorse," which it resembles.	hippocampus这个词源自拉丁语，有海马之意 因为脑中海马区的形状看上去有点像海马。
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.	海马区和大脑其它区域的组成相似，都由神经元构成。
So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it.	人的大脑 由大约一千亿个神经元细胞组成。
And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other.	每个神经元细胞之间通过一些连接中介 互相发送小的电脉冲或者尖峰电压 来进行交流。
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells, which are very densely interconnected.	海马区由两层片状的细胞群构成， 这两层细胞群紧密相连。
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food.	科学家们通过记录 老鼠在某环境中搜罗食物时 其脑中单个神经元细胞的反应 来了解 空间记忆的工作原理 与工作机制。
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here.	现在想象一下，我们正在为这只老鼠的海马区中的 一个神经元细胞录像。
And when it fires a little spike of electricity, there's going to be a red dot and a click.	每当这个细胞发出小型尖峰电压， 随后会出现一个红点以及咔哒的一声。
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.	我们可以看出 每当老鼠进入环境中某一特定位置， 这个神经元细胞便会有反应。
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike.	然后这个细胞再通过小型尖峰电压 将以上信息传递给大脑的其它区域。
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal's location.	这么一来，我们可以凭借这个细胞发送信号的频率 推知老鼠经过的相应位置。
And if we record from lots of different neurons, we'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment, like in this square box shown here.	倘若我们记录的是很多不同的神经元细胞， 就会发现当老鼠处于不同的位置上时， 不同的神经元细胞会产生各自的电信号， 正如我们在这些方形中看到的那样。
So together they form a map for the rest of the brain, telling the brain continually, "Where am I now within my environment?"	这些信号为大脑中的其它区域 勾勒出一张地图， 持续地向大脑指示出， 我现在位于环境中的哪个具体点上？
Place cells are also being recorded in humans.	我们也记录人脑中的定位神经元细胞。
So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.	癫痫病患者有时需要监测 他们的脑电活动情况。
And some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town.	一些患者玩一种电子游戏， 游戏中他们在一个小镇上自由开车。
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active, start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.	然后当他们驱车驶过镇上的某一处时， 他们大脑海马区中的定位神经元细胞 便会被激活，发出信号。
So how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment?	那么这定位细胞 是怎么知道老鼠或人处于某个位置的呢？
Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important.	这里有两个神经元细胞， 它们告诉我们，在定位时 环境的边界是至关重要的。
So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in.	上面的这个细胞倾向于 在老鼠向盒子中部走去时 产生信号。
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.	因此当你将盒子扩大，相应的信号活跃区也随之扩大。
The one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south.	下面的这个喜欢在 老鼠紧邻南面屏障时作出反应。
And if you put another wall inside the box, then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box.	因此当你在盒中放入另一屏障时， 不论老鼠在盒中何处， 只要它的南面有屏障， 该细胞中的相应位置便会同时产生信号。
So this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus.	这表明 了解到达边界——比如周边的建筑物等 需要的距离和方向 对于海马区的工作而言至关重要。
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus, cells are found which project into the hippocampus, which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around.	而且确实，在老鼠搜罗环境时， 我们在海马区的输入信号中， 检测到能对 距环境边界的特定距离 与方向作出 精确感应的 神经元细胞。
So the cell on the left, you can see, it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east, whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.	这里左边的细胞，你可以看出， 当老鼠向东靠近边界或屏障时， 该细胞都会作出反应， 不论这边界是一个方盒的边 还是一个圆柱盒的边 甚至是老鼠绕着转的桌布的垂帘。
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south, whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.	而右面的细胞 则是在老鼠南面出现边界时响应， 不论这边界是桌布的垂帘还是一堵墙 甚至是两个被隔开的桌子之间的间隙。
So that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.	以上是我们所推测的一种 定位细胞给动物定位的方式。
We can also test where we think objects are, like this goal flag, in simple environments -- or indeed, where your car would be.	我们也可检测，人类在简单环境中， 是怎样给——诸如这面旗这样的物体定位的 或者干脆——把这物体想成你的车。
So we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember.	我们先让人们熟悉一下环境， 同时记下物体所在的位置。
And then, if we put them back in the environment, generally they're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was.	接着，再让他们回到那个环境， 通常他们都能根据记忆 准确无误地标出物体所在的位置。
But on some trials, we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell.	但在一些试验中， 我们会改变环境的形状和尺度， 正如我们在定位细胞实验中所做的那样。
In that case, we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.	如此，我们可以通过研究 实验者改变环境的形状和尺度， 来了解旗帜发生了怎样的位移
And what you see, for example, if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment, and then if you ask people where it was, but you've made the environment bigger, where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out.	比如现在你所看到的， 假设这面旗帜在如图中小四方形内的×的位置， 然后接着你问人们小旗在哪， 但实际上你已经将总环境的尺度扩大了， 结果他们所认为的旗所在的位置 也相应地向外扩张， 而这扩张的模式和定位细胞的一模一样。
It's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location, and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern.	这就好像你是通过存储被某一 特定位置所激发的定位细胞产生的信号模式 来记忆小旗的位置的， 接着当你回到那个地点的时候， 通过四处打量， 便可以将你当前脑中定位细胞的信号模式 与之前的模式进行匹配。
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.	这个过程便可让你回到老地方。
But we also know where we are through movement.	我们也能通过位移来给自己定位。
So if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements, which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back.	因此当我们外出时—— 或许是我们停车后下来随便走走—— 我们可以给自己定位，因为我们 可以粗略地将自己的运动路线 与大体的返回方向进行整合。
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell.	定位细胞也能从一种叫做网状细胞的细胞那儿 获得此类线路整合的信息。
Now grid cells are found, again, on the inputs to the hippocampus, and they're a bit like place cells.	目前在向海马区的信号输入中 又发现了网状细胞， 它们与定位细胞有点类似。
But now as the rat explores around, each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid.	随着老鼠的四处探索， 每一个神经元细胞 被大量各种位置所激发的信号 组合在一起，贯穿整个环境 构成一个令人惊叹的规整的三角网格。
And if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment, and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells.	倘若你对一系列网状细胞进行记录—— 这里以不同的颜色区分—— 每一个细胞发出的信号都能形成网状，遍及整个环境， 而且每一个细胞的网状信号集的位置都与其他细胞 有一定偏差。
So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.	因此红色标注的细胞信号集合在这个网格上， 绿色的是这个，而蓝色的是这个。
So together, it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map, but using triangles.	因此综合来看，这就好像老鼠可以 在它所到达的环境中建立一个 虚拟的位置信号网—— 这就有点像你在地图上所看到的经线和纬线， 只不过要将线替换成三角形。
And as it moves around, the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is, so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment.	当老鼠移动的时候， 这些电信号 能通过这些细胞传递给下一个神经元细胞 从而为老鼠定位， 这样老鼠就能在运动时 知道自己身在何处。
Do people have grid cells?	那么人类是否有网状细胞呢？
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between.	因为所有的网状信号集合体 都有相同的对称轴，以及 相同的网格朝向，这里以橘红色标识， 这就意味着大脑中特定部位 的所有网状细胞的联网行为 的变化应该取决于 我们是在向着这六个方向运动还是 沿着六个方向之间所夹的某一个方向运动。
So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal.	我们可以为人们做核磁共振扫描， 与此同时让他们玩一个小型电子游戏， 还是之前所说的那个游戏， 然后来看看当时的信号。
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex, which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.	啊哈没错，你在人脑中的内嗅皮层上看到了网状细胞， 而它们出现的位置和老鼠的网状细胞在大脑中所出现的位置一样。
So back to Homer.	现在我们回头看看荷马。
He's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked.	他可能凭借与周边建筑 以及四周边界的 相对距离和方向来回忆 他的车停在哪儿。
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.	而那将由专门检测边界的 神经元细胞发出的信号来执行。
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park, which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.	他可能也记得自己是怎么从停车场走出来的， 而这就有赖于网状细胞发出信号了。
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire.	这两种类型的神经元细胞 都可以激活定位细胞。
And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car.	因此荷马成功折返的方法 便是在走动中寻求与他之前 停车时脑中所建立的 信号集样式最为匹配的 一个脑中即时形成的信号集样式。
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there.	而那就能将他领回老地方了， 这个过程与最终的目标视物无关 不论他的车是否还在那儿他都能找到停车点。
Maybe it's been towed.	或许车已经被拖走了，
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.	但他仍然知道车原来停在哪，因此他会回到原位去取车。
So beyond spatial memory, if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain, we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks, like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.	撇开空间记忆力而言， 倘若我们单独观察这种网状信号集 在整个大脑中的活动情况， 就会发现这种信号形式分布广泛， 每当我们需要回忆一些自己过去的经历时 这种网状的信号形式就会活跃起来， 譬如，当你试图回忆上次参加婚礼的情况时
So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least, of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.	因此有可能，神经元细胞 再现空间的功能 也参与视觉画面的呈现 这样当我们试图回忆一个曾经置身其中的场面时， 至少可以借助想象而勾勒出整个场景。
So if this was happening, your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint.	倘若事实果真如此， 记忆的形成就开始于：定位细胞通过这些缜密的连结 相互激活 然后边界感应细胞被再次激活 从而形成我们视点周围的场景的 空间格局。
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.	网状细胞可以使视点穿透那个空间。
Another kind of cell, head direction cells, which I didn't mention yet, they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.	而另一种方位细胞， 我之前没有提到它， 它们像指南针一样，都是根据你的朝向来作出反应的。
They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery, so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.	它们可以明确 你需要在脑中形成哪个方位的图像， 就拿回忆婚礼情景来说，以上过程就能让你回想起那一切。
So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.	好了，以上就是在 认知神经科学领域 所开辟的新纪元， 在这个领域中， 我们开始尝试从大脑中数以亿计的 单个神经元细胞的行为出发， 来了解 人类心理活动产生的过程。比如人们是如何记忆、想象甚至思考的
Thank you very much.	谢谢各位。

What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request.	我原本想 以一个简单的请求开场。
I'd like all of you to pause for a moment, you wretched weaklings, and take stock of your miserable existence.	我请求在座的各位 思考片刻， 你们这群可悲的懦夫， 扪心自问，审视一下自身可怜的存在。
Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century.	其实这正是 5世纪时圣本笃给信众的建议， 可以想见，当时他们必定相当惊诧。
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40.	而在我40岁的时候 我也决定采纳并实施这个建议。
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior -- I was eating too much, I was drinking too much, I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family.	在那之前，我绝对是个典型的业务精英—— 我吃的太多，喝得太多， 工作太努力， 我忽视了自己的家庭。
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around.	于是我决定 试着改变我的生活。
In particular, I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance.	而且我决定 我要尝试处理一个棘手的问题： 即工作与生活的平衡。
So I stepped back from the workforce, and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children.	于是我递交辞呈， 赋闲在家， 与妻子和四个儿子相处了一年。
But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work.	但是在那一年中 关于工作与生活平衡这个问题，我唯一的收获是： 如果我不工作， 这个问题 就会迎刃而解。
Not a very useful skill, especially when the money runs out.	这的确不怎么管用， 尤其是缺钱的时候。
So I went back to work, and I've spent these seven years since struggling with, studying and writing about work-life balance.	所以我回到工作岗位， 七年以来 我的挣扎，学习 与写作都围绕着工作与生活的平衡这个主题。
And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today.	今天我想跟各位分享 四点心得。
The first is: if society's to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate.	第一， 如果在这一问题上想要获得实质性的进展， 那么我们需要一个诚恳的探讨。
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance.	但问题是 在这一问题上， 人们大多沉浸在毫无意义的争论之中。
All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue, which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family.	无论是弹性时间 还是星期五的休闲装政策 亦或是育儿假， 这些都只是进一步掩盖了核心问题， 即 某些职业和某些职业选择 从根本上讲就与 每天与自己的家庭 亲密相处 这一生活方式水火不容。
And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like.	 他们夜以继日的 从事他们痛恨的职业 目的只是为了购买无用的商品 以博得无关痛痒的邻人的艳羡。
It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.	我的观点是，星期五穿牛仔体恤 并不能解决关键问题。
The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us.	我想分享的第二点心得是 我们必须面对现实： 政府和公司 不会为我们解决这一问题。
We should stop looking outside.	我们不能再寻找外援，
It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead.	而应该作为个人 承担起掌控 自己生活轨迹的重任。
If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you, and you may just not like their idea of balance.	如果你不规划自己的生活， 那么别人就会为你规划， 而他们对于平衡的处理 你往往并不认同。
It's particularly important -- this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it?	最重要的是—— 这东西不会传到互联网上吧，要不然我可要被解雇了—— 最重要的是 你绝不能让商业公司 来掌控你生活的质量。
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies -- the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.	因为商业公司 本质上就是为了 尽可能多的榨取你的价值 而同时尽量逃避责任。
I'm talking about all companies.	这是深植于商业公司之中的基因。 它们以此立足—— 包括那些好的，有善心的公司。
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [as] they can get away with.	一方面， 在工作场所开办儿童保育中心 是个很妙的，具有启发性的好主意。
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA; it's what they do -- even the good, well-intentioned companies.	另一方面，这同时是个噩梦； 因为这意味着你得在万恶的办公室里耗上更多时间。
On the one hand, putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened.	我们自己得担起责任 去设定并强化 我们生活中的各种界限。
On the other hand, it's a nightmare -- it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.	第三点是 我们得好好考虑 以什么样的时间单位 来衡量我们试图实现的平衡。
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life.	在一年赋闲时 就在我回到工作岗位之前， 我坐下来 细细地 一步一步地勾勒了一幅 我向往的完美一天的 理想蓝图。
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance.	具体如下： 充足的睡眠之后， 精神抖擞的醒来。
Before I went back to work after my year at home, I sat down and I wrote out a detailed, step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to.	做爱。
And it went like this: wake up well rested after a good night's sleep.	遛狗。
Have sex.	与妻儿共进早餐。
Walk the dog.	做爱。
Have breakfast with my wife and children.	上班的途中送孩子去学校。
Have sex again.	工作三小时。
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.	午休时和朋友玩玩体育。
Do three hours' work.	再工作三小时。
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.	下午和老伙计们在酒吧喝两杯。
Do another three hours' work.	回家， 与妻儿共进晚餐。
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.	花半个小时静修思考。
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids.	做爱。
Meditate for half an hour.	遛狗。
Have sex again.	我们当然要实际一些。
Go to bed.	你不可能在一天内实现这一切。
How often do you think I have that day?	我们得把时间单位拉长 来衡量我们期望的平衡， 但是这一拉长也不是没有限度的 比如，你最好别说： 我会享受生活的，当我退休了， 当子女也都独立， 当妻子已弃我而去，当我的身体大不如前， 当我已没有朋友，也没有任何兴趣爱好。
We need to be realistic.	一天太短，退休又太长。
You can't do it all in one day.	肯定会有折中的办法。
We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life, but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the "I'll have a life when I retire, when my kids have left home, when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing, I've got no mates or interests left."	第四点心得： 要实现平衡， 我们得采取平衡的办法。
A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.	去年我有个朋友来找我—— 她不介意我公开这个故事——去年她来我这儿， 她说：奈吉尔，我看了你的书。
There's got to be a middle way.	我意识到我的生活完全没有平衡可言。
A fourth observation: We need to approach balance in a balanced way.	它完全被无休止的工作占据。
A friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.	我每天工作10小时，路上就要花2小时。
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.	我的人际关系总是失败。
It's totally dominated by work.	在我生活中 除了工作，没有别的。
There's nothing in my life apart from my work.	于是我加入了健身俱乐部。
So I joined a gym."	我不是要嘲笑她， 但是一个健康的每天工作10小时的办公室职员 并不会让她更平衡，而只能更健康。
Now I don't mean to mock, but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn't more balanced; it's more fit.	健身运动的确是不错， 但生活的含义其实很丰富。
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.	你却要我去教堂、给老妈打电话。
You want me to go to church and call my mother."	我很理解。
And I understand.	我真的很理解，对人们来说这的确挺艰巨。
I truly understand how that can be daunting.	但两年前有件小事 却给了我一个崭新的视角。
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.	因为那天晚上她和其他三个孩子在一起。
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates.	于是那天下午我提前一小时下班 在校门口接到哈里。
We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings, played some silly games.	我们去了公园， 在秋千上闹了一阵，做了些傻傻的游戏。
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe, and we shared a pizza for two, then walked down the hill to our home, and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas.	然后我带他上了一座小山到了当地的一家咖啡馆， 我们点了茶和比萨， 吃完就下山回家， 我给他洗了个澡， 给他穿上蝙蝠侠睡衣。
I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."	然后我给他读了一章 Roald Dahl的《詹姆斯与飞天巨桃》。
I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate," and walked out of his bedroom.	然后我铺好床，安顿好他， 吻了他的额头，说了声晚安，伙计。 然后走出他的卧室。
As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, "Dad?"	正当我走到门口的时候， 他叫了声老爸。什么事，伙计？
I went, "Yes, mate?"	
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day of my life, ever."	他说，老爸，这是我一生中 最棒的一天，最棒的。
I hadn't done anything, hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.	其实我什么也没做。 我没带他去迪斯尼乐园，也没给他买游戏机。
Now my point is the small things matter.	我想说的是， 小事并非无关紧要。
Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.	在生活中实现平衡 并不意味着你要大张旗鼓的颠覆你的生活。
With the smallest investment in the right places, you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life.	在适当的地方 做些小小的投资， 你就能极大地改善你的人际关系 和生活质量。
Moreover, I think, it can transform society.	不仅如此，我认为 这还能改变整个社会。
Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like.	因为，如果很多人都如此生活， 那么我们就可以重新对社会上的所谓成功进行定义： 成功不再是以死后财产的多少 来愚蠢地衡量； 成功应该有一个更具平衡性和思想性的定义， 即一个美好的生活的实现。
And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading.	我认为 这的确是一个值得与众人分享的点子。
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values.	今日我要讨论科学和人类价值观 之间的关系
Now, it's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion.	我们一般认为 有关道德问题 善恶对错的概念 是科学所不能解决和参与讨论的
It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what we ought to value.	人们认为科学可以帮助我们 得到我们所想要的 却永远无法告诉我们什么是重要的
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life: questions like, "What is worth living for?"	于是大部分的人，甚至今日坐在这里的各位 认为科学永远无法回答 人类生命中的重要问题 像是我们为了什么活着？
"What is worth dying for?"	我们应该为什么牺牲？
"What constitutes a good life?"	什么样的生活，是一个幸福的生活？
So, I'm going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history.	我想告诉大家 把科学和人类价值观做分隔 是一种人为假象 是一个非常危险的假象 尤其是在我们的今日社会
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.	但我认为这很明显是错误的
Values are a certain kind of fact.	价值自然是一种实证
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.	是人类如何可以获得幸福生活的实证
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?	为什么我们对石头没有任何道德要求？
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?	为什么我们对石头没有仁爱之情？
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects, as indeed we are, it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering.	因为我们不认为石头会受折磨 如果和昆虫做比较 我们比较关心我们自己的物种 那是因为我们认为我们比昆虫 能感受到更大程度的快乐或痛苦
Now, the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim: This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.	其中的意义是 这个说法是有实证的 这中间是有对错的 如果我们在生物复杂性和知觉体验的关系上 做出了错误的推估 那代表我们有可能错估了昆虫的内心生活
And there's no notion, no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes.	但是我发觉 从没有一种道德 和价值观 是和人类的感知体验 和尝试改变这感知体验的可能性 无关的
Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death -- either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell -- you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.	就算你的价值观来自宗教 就算你认为善恶 和死后的结果有关联 永远和神在快乐的国度里逍遥 或是永远在地狱之火中燃烧 这仍然两种不同的感知体验有关
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which, of course, may or may not be true.	认为这些体验会一直持续到死后的世界 也是在追求一种实证 虽然谁也不知道死后的世界会如何
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life, for human beings, we know that there is a continuum of such facts.	谈到幸福生活的基础 身为人类，在此生 我们知道有些事实一直存在
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?	在水中加入霍乱病毒是对的吗？
Probably not.	大概不是
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye, so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors?	每个人都相信邪恶之眼的魔力 于是当某些不幸事件发生 他们马上就开始怪罪他们的邻舍？
Probably not.	大概也不是
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand these truths.	我们应该去理解 人类社群迈向繁荣的方法 无论我们现在能不能理解
And morality relates to these truths.	或把这些事实和道德做联结
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.	当我们讨论价值，我们就是在讨论事实
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels -- from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements.	世界的现况可以用很多不同层次来看 从染色体的层次 一直到经济体系 和政治协议的层次
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain.	就算背着炸弹自杀死后能得到72个处女 在此生，他的人格 这令人遗憾的人格 也是由他的大脑所产出
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing our brains.	于是，文化的贡献是 － 是因为文化会改变我们的想法 也就是改变我们大脑的思考模式
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can, at least in principle, be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience, psychology, etc.	于是不管有多少不同文化 对人类的幸福有多少不同想法 都可以原则性地 以成熟的闹内科学作为理解的办法 神经科学、心理学等等
So, what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings.	我想说的是 价值观可以以事实 有关人类感知体验的事实 作为准则
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings.	我们才有可能想象在某个情况下 来改变这些人的体验
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape, with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective.	这就像一片道德风景 有不同的山巅和峡谷 像是人类对于幸福生活的不同感知 无论是个人或群体的
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access.	我们该注意的是 或许有个人类幸福的所在 是我们从来没有去过的，很少人能达到的体验
And these await our discovery.	正在等待我们去发掘
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual.	或许这些体验就是我们所说的 神秘或灵性的体验
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them.	或许有些是我们根本无法体验的 因为我们的大脑有自己的回路 但其它人却有可能可以到达
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying.	我必须澄清，我并不是说 科学可以完全地为我们画出这份幸福地图 或是科学可以回答所有的 道德争议
But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.	承认吧 当我们尝试解决人类幸福的问题 是可能会有错误答案的 承认这个事实能改变我们讨论道德的方法 也会改变我们在合作共创未来时 所期待的结果
And just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality, and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future.	举例来说，在美国还有21个州 在课堂上进行体罚是合法的 老师可以合法的用木板 把孩子打得瘀伤、起水泡、甚至破皮
For instance, there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal, where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard, and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.	每年有千百个孩子 都在遭受这样的待遇
And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally, are subjected to this every year.	而且我认为，你会很吃惊，这都是些什么省份
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.	不是康涅狄格州
We're not talking about Connecticut.	宗教往往是这些做法背后的理由
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.	创造宇宙的造物主说 告诉我们不要不忍用仗 不然会宠坏孩子 这是《旧约箴言》第13章20，和23节
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod, lest we spoil the child -- this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.	我们可以问一个简单的问题 以常理判断 让孩子经历这样的痛苦 暴力和在众人面前被羞辱 会带来健康的情绪发展 和良好行为模式吗？
Is there any doubt that this question has an answer, and that it matters?	而且，怎么可能有一种完全客观的 人身幸福的标准存在呢？
And so, how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being?	如同 Michael Specter 适才说道，这些概念也会改变
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.	如果你有这种状况，人们会捐钱给你
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30.	我们知道健康的观念会改变 随时都可以重新思考 这不代表这些讨论是毫无意义的
It's now around 80 in the developed world.	一个健康的人和一个死人 之间的差别 在科学或理论里是一样的
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.	另外一个该注意的事情是道德地图上虽然有很多山巅 是有可能可以一起努力 一起找出一个管理人类社会的方法 一起找出最大的幸福
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.	为什么我们不能将这个 当作客观道德的基础？
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does not make it vacuous.	想象我们讨论食物的方式 我永远不会和你争辩 人类应该有吃的自由
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.	一个健康的饮食方式中 有许多不同食物
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape: There may be equivalent ways to thrive; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing.	但从没有人会把食物和毒物 搞错
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food.	为什么我们会这样想
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison.	让我们以国际象棋为例
The fact that there are many right answers to the question, "What is food?"	如果你想玩一盘漂亮的国际象棋 别失去你的皇后 是一个很好的原则
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.	但它也有例外
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.	在某些时候牺牲皇后是一种很漂亮的打法
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.	我们怎么能说，他们是错误的 当他们用钢索痛打她们 或是把强酸泼到她们脸上 如果她们拒绝被这样对待？
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.	我们凭什么可以这样说呢？
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.	我们怎么可以装作 我们完全不了解人类的幸福 或是我们应该对此类行为保持中立？
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all.	我不是在说那些自发性的蒙头 我认为女人应该想穿什么就穿什么
Well this is one thing you can do about them: You can cover them up.	让这些事实在你脑中转一转： 你的女儿被强暴了 你的反应竟然是杀掉她
And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable, or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?	我必须承认，对大部分的男人来说 可能需要有博士学位才会觉得这有什么不对
Well, who are we not to say this?	但在我们自省的时候 我们也可以想 这样的东西会让我们 学习尊重不同女性的 年龄和肉体吗？
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?	难道我们会希望我们的孩子 生在在这种视觉环境里吗？
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil -- women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.	大概不会。 于是在这两个极端中 应该有一个中间点 能带来一种比较健康的平衡
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute: Your daughter gets raped, and what you want to do is kill her.	在我看来，讽刺的事情是 一般会认同我说法的 那些觉得道德争议是有正确和错误答案的 大都是一些宗教家
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing?	他们当然会觉得道德争议有正确答案 因为他们已经在神秘之声中听到这些答案了 而不是因为他们理智思考和分析过这些议题 人类和动物的幸福快乐
Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society.	事实上，在许久以来 宗教成为人们关注道德的角度 让所有的道德议题 都和人类和动物的痛苦脱钩
For instance, this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world.	这就是为什么我们花费精神 讨论同性恋是不是应该结婚 而不是种族灭绝或是核子武器激增 或是贫穷和其它一样严重的议题
Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.	但这些宗教煽动者说对了一件事 我们需要一个普世价值
I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children?	当我们讨论道德，我们就开始尊重不同意见 但我们在其它方面不会这样做
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance.	举例来说，达赖喇嘛每天早上起来 思考仁爱精神 他认为帮助其它人类是 带来人类快乐的一部分
Now the irony, from my perspective, is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another.	大部分的西方学者 看到这个状况 会说，嗯事实上达赖喇嘛也不是 完全正确，绝对正确 Ted Bundy 也不是绝对错误 这其中没有真正的讨论价值 这是科学范畴的事
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind, not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being.	他喜欢巧克力，他喜欢香草
Now, what stands in the way of this?	那么，如果我出现在一个物理研讨会 然后说弦理论是个假货
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular, academic, scientist types.	我对它没有感觉，这不是我选择 的宇宙观
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.	我不是那派的。
So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion, and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness.	什么都不会发生，因为我不是物理学家 我不懂弦理论
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.	为什么我们要说服自己 所有的意见都应该纳入考虑？
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other."	我们是怎么说服自己 所有的文化对这些事情都有自己的观点 而我们都应该把他们纳入考量？
Notice that we don't do this in science.	难道塔利班 对物理学的意见 也值得我们考虑吗？不。
On the left you have Edward Witten.	但他们对幸福的无知 和他们对物理的无知有什么不同？
He's a string theorist.	现在世界所需要的是
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around, in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.	像我们这样的人们承认 在人类的幸福问题中 是有正确和错误答案的 以及道德 是和事实有直接关联的
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.	个人 或整个文化 过分关心某些错误议题是绝对可能的 他们的信仰和想法也绝对有可能 为人类带来 无必要的痛苦
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said,"String theory is bogus.	承认这些事实会改变我们讨论道德的方式
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale.	在今日世界中 国界的意义不断减弱 有一天国界将没有任何意义
I'm not a fan."	我们住在一个充满危险科技的世界 这些科技可以不要被发明 因为捣毁一样事情 永远比重建容易
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist; I don't understand string theory.	我认为，很明显地 我们不能再 尊重和容忍这些 对人类幸福的不同观点 就像我们不会尊重和容忍 传染病的散播 或是建筑和飞机的安全标准
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.	我们必须承认，这些问题 能找到解答，才有可能
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.	回答人类生命中最重要的这些问题。
But this is just the point.	谢谢大家。
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded.	Chris Anderson：让我提出一些争议性的问题
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.	这里有某些人，或现在在世界上别的角落 可能有人听见这个 然后愤怒或尖叫。
How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering?	她们可能会有别种想法。她们会说 不，这是对女性的一种礼赞 凸显我们是特别的， 这帮助我们这个，而且是因为那个…… 当然这不是一种非常可靠的心理学论点 你不能信任男人的情欲
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No.	我们是否可以用一种 不带着文化帝国主义的角度和这些女人讨论这些问题
How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?	Sam Harris：让我一边看着秒针 一边尝试简短回答这个问题 真正的问题是 这真的是她们的个人意愿吗 在男人期待你戴上面罩 如果不戴就必须承受某种后果 的状况下？
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.	如果在这个房间里 有任何人想要戴面罩 一个非常可笑的帽子，或是在脸上刺青 我想每个人应该做我们想做的，在自愿的情况下 但我们必须诚实面对 这些女人的处境
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing, and morality relates to that domain of facts.	我认为我们不应该太快地 接受她们的说法 尤其在120度高温 而你竟然必须蒙住全身的状况下
It is possible for individuals, and even for whole cultures, to care about the wrong things, which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering.	许多人想要相信 道德进步的这个概念
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.	但是这有可能达到和谐吗？
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less, and they will one day mean nothing.	我想我了解你所说的 不要让世界变得只有一种道德 也不需要大家都只有一种想法
We live in a world filled with destructive technology, and this technology cannot be uninvented; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them.	你可以告诉我们 如果我们快转到50年后 100年后，你希望我们的世界 能如何在道德进步和多元文化中 找到平衡
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.	我们不能再自由心证
Thank you very much.	为了得到男人的青睐 就让我刚出生的女儿蒙头 或是教导她成为一个 自信而有教养的女性 是完全不同的两件事
So, some combustible material there.	我想我们不需要国家科学基金会特别拨款 才能发现强制女人蒙头很不好 到了某种程度 我们可以扫描每个人的头脑 并研究它们
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world, hearing some of this, may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.	人们真的爱它们的女儿吗 就算在那样的文化下？
Language seems to be really important here.	我想这些问题是有正确答案的。
And so, if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil, or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face -- I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under.	虽然现在不行，或许在不远的将来。谢谢你来 TED 演讲
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it, especially when it's 120 degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa.	S.H.：是我的荣幸，谢谢你。
A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress.	问候。
But can you reconcile that?	早上好。
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.	考虑到我的TED履历，你可能期待 我会跟你们探讨 最新的慈善趋势， 新的让华尔街 和世界银行都兴奋， 那便是怎样在女性身上投资， 怎样授予她们全力，怎样拯救她们。
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward, 100 years forward, how you would like to think of the world, balancing moral progress with richness.	那不是我。
SH: Well, I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail, then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail.	我对女性如何 拯救我们更有兴趣。
So, we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion, and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it -- whether they're genetic, whether they're how people talk to one another, whether they're economic systems, and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space.	她们拯救我们，重新定义和重新想像 一个反抗和模糊 传统冲突的未来， 那些我们认为理所当然的冲突， 像现代与传统之间的冲突， 发达国家与发展中国家之间的冲突， 压迫与机会之间的冲突。
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.	在这些我们作为一个国际社会 所面对的使人气馁的挑战中， 就有那么一个 另类的拉伽 使我的心在唱歌。
It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women.	最令我好奇的是 这些女性如何面对这些挑战， 尽管她们知道这是一对 既令人沮丧又让人兴奋的矛盾论。
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems?	是不同的女性 在保存和在引领激进？
And I think there are clearly right answers to that.	还是她们是同一个群体？
And if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues?	我们应该感到惭愧吗？正如 Chimamanda Adichie 在牛津的一个TED研讨会上提醒我们， 不要总是认为只有一个同样的 女性为她们的权利而斗争的故事， 因为事实上有许多这样不同的故事，
SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact, that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system.	还有， 这些跟男人有什么关系？
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."	我的人生大部分时间都在探索， 试图得到这些问题的答案。
If you get all those parts aligned, yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.	这带着我穿越国界， 并让我认识了一些非常不可思议的人。
But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context.	在整个过程当中，我聚集了一些片断 来帮助我解答这个疑问。
It's all of us in this together, not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus.	在这些帮助我开阔视野 认识另类的人当中， 有一个虔诚的阿富汗伊斯兰教信徒， 一群克罗地亚和声唱女同性恋者， 还有一个利比里亚的善于打破禁忌的人。
Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours.	我对她们非常的感恩， 就像我对自己的父母一般， 他们因为前世的一些轻罪， 今生得到了三个女儿。
We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.	不知道是什么原因， 他们却非常的为我们三个感到自豪。
SH: Really an honor.	我生于长于印度， 并且我从小就懂得 对那些阿姨叔叔有所怀疑， 他们会弯腰，拍拍我们的头 然后他们会对我的父母 毫不犹豫的说， 可怜的东西。
Thank you.	 你们只有三个女儿。
Salaam.	但是你们都还年轻，还可以试试。
Namaskar.	
Good morning.	我那股 对女性权利的义愤 在我11岁的时候毅然激起。
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends -- the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing -- how to invest in women, how to empower them, how to save them.	我的阿姨，一位非常口齿伶俐 非常美丽的女士， 早年丧夫。
Not me.	一大群亲戚驾临她家。
I am interested in how women are saving us.	他们把她的五彩莎丽脱去。
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities, polarities we've taken for granted for a long time, like the ones between modernity and tradition, First World and Third World, oppression and opportunity.	他们逼使她带上一个苍白的莎丽。
In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community, there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing.	他们把她的额前痣抹去。
What intrigues me most is how women are doing this, despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating.	他们把她的手镯打碎。
When so many women and girls are beaten, raped, maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes -- honor, religion, nationality -- what allows women to replant trees, to rebuild societies, to lead radical, non-violent movements for social change?	那天晚上，我听见我母亲 哀求我的父亲， 请你为Ramu想想办法。
Is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?	难道你就不能阻止他们吗？
Are we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us at the TED conference in Oxford, of assuming that there is a single story of women's struggles for their rights while there are, in fact, many?	我的父亲，低沉的喃喃自语道， 我只是家里最年轻的兄弟，我无能为力。
Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions.	这是传统。
It's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people.	那便是我懂得 在这个社会做女人的意味着什么。
In the process, I've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle.	我们女人不创立那些规矩， 但是那些规矩定义我们，并定义 我们的机会和机遇。
Among those who've helped open my eyes to a third way are: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan, a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia and a taboo breaker in Liberia.	男人也被这些规矩影响。
I'm indebted to them, as I am to my parents, who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life, were blessed with three daughters in this one.	我的父亲，曾经参与三场战争， 却不能帮助他自己的姐姐 脱离这场悲剧。
And for reasons equally unclear to me, seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.	还不到18岁， 在我母亲非凡的教导下， 我，像你们所像的一般， 是一个大胆的女权运动者。
I was born and raised here in India, and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down, pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all, "Poor things. You only have three daughters.	在街上喊着， [印度语］ [印度语］ 我们是印度的妇女，
But you're young, you could still try again."	我们不是脆弱的花朵，我们是社会转变的火花。
My sense of outrage about women's rights was brought to a boil when I was about 11.	1995年，在我到达北京前， 我深深的知道，唯一 通往两性平等的道路 便是推翻世纪长的 压迫的传统。
My aunt, an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman, was widowed early.	在我从北京回来不久， 我马上决定为这个不同凡响的 由女性创立的组织工作， 支持全球妇女权利组织。
A flock of relatives descended on her.	但是六个月不到， 我认识了一位女士， 一位让我不得不挑战我之前的假定的女士。
They took off her colorful sari.	她叫Sakena Yacoobi。
They made her wear a white one.	她走进我的办公室 在一个没有任何美国人知道 阿富汗在哪的时代。
They wiped her bindi off her forehead.	她对我说，这跟布卡没有关系。
They broke her bangles.	她是我所见过的最坚决的 女权拥护者。
Her daughter, Rani, a few years older than me, sat in her lap bewildered, not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother.	她告诉我妇女在她那深入阿富汗的社区里 开办地下学校 还有，她的组织，阿富汗学习学会， 在巴基斯坦也开办了一个学校。
Late that night, I heard my mother begging my father, "Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"	她说，任何伊斯兰教徒都知道的第一件事， 便是可兰经规定 并强烈支持读写能力。
And my father, in a low voice, muttering, "I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.	先知想让所有的信徒 都可以自己读写可兰经。
This is tradition."	我所听到的是真的吗？
That's the night I learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world.	一个女权拥护者 居然激发宗教信仰？
Women don't make those rules, but they define us, and they define our opportunities and our chances.	可是Sakena违抗标记。
And men are affected by those rules too.	她一直都只戴一个头巾。
My father, who had fought in three wars, could not save his own sister from this suffering.	 我跟她在海边散布过， 她的长头发在风中飘扬。
By 18, under the excellent tutelage of my mother, I was therefore, as you might expect, defiantly feminist.	她每堂课开始之前都先做一个祈祷， 可是她是一位单身，坚决 经济独立的女性， 生活在一个女孩在12岁的时候便出嫁的国度。
On the streets chanting, "[Hindi] [Hindi] We are the women of India.	她也非常讲求实效。
We are not flowers, we are sparks of change."	这个头巾和这些衣服， 她说道， 赋予我去做我必须的事的自由 去跟这个运动急需的支持和帮助 的那些人探讨。
By the time I got to Beijing in 1995, it was clear to me, the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition.	当我需要在难民营中开办这个学校， 我去拜见了伊玛目。
Soon after I returned from Beijing, I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization, founded by women, to support women's rights organizations around the globe.	我告诉他，我是一个信徒，这些妇女和孩子 在如此水深火热当中 需要他们的信念来生存。
But barely six months into my new job, I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions.	 她俏皮的笑笑。
Her name is Sakena Yacoobi.	他被奉承得很满意。
She walked into my office at a time when no one knew where Afghanistan was in the United States.	他开始每星期来我的中心两次 因为这些妇女不能到清真寺。
She told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside Afghanistan, and that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning, had started a school in Pakistan.	我们开始一个小小的读写班级 来念可兰经， 然后开始一个数学课，再一个英语课，再一个电脑课。
She said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows is that the Koran requires and strongly supports literacy.	短短几个星期，每个在难民营的人 都来上我们的课。 
She always wears a headscarf, but I've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze.	她身居塔利班的打击对象名单。
She starts every lecture with a prayer, but she's a single, feisty, financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.	她每次穿越那个国家，我都得为她担心。
She is also immensely pragmatic.	每次我问她安全问题，她总是不在乎的耸耸肩。
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says, "give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work.	Kavita Jan, 我们可不能让自己害怕。
When I had to open the school in the refugee camp, I went to see the imam. She smiles slyly.	看看那些年轻的重新上学的女孩子 她们的脸被泼硫酸。
"He was flattered.	她们的道路是她们自己的 这条道路正朝着一个创造不同的阿富汗 的方向发展。
He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque.	与别人不同是一件 克罗地亚 Zagreb, Lesbor的女人 司空见惯的事。
And after he would leave, women and girls would stay behind.	作为一位女同性恋者， 一位同性恋者 在世界的大部分角落，包括在这里， 我们的祖国，印度， 等同于生活在一个极度不适 以及极度歧视的环境里。
We began with a small literacy class to read the Koran, then a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.	在像克罗地亚这样的战后社会里， 极端爱国主义与宗教信仰 创造了一个让任何被社会排挤的 人 无法忍受的恶劣环境。
In a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes."	想像一群女同性恋者， 一群年轻的，热爱 传遍整个地区的传统音乐的女人， 从马其顿到波斯尼亚， 从塞尔维亚到斯洛文尼亚。
Sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in Afghanistan.	这些民歌手相识在大学里的一个两性学习研究。
She is on the Taliban's hit list.	许多都只有20多岁。
I worry about her every time she travels across that country.	有些已为人母。
She shrugs when I ask her about safety.	许多都得艰难的在她们的社区公开她们的性取向。
And I smile, and I nod, realizing I'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices, turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity.	Leah，这个小组的发起人之一，说道， 我很喜欢传统音乐。
Their path is their own and it looks towards an Afghanistan that will be different.	我也很喜欢摇滚音乐。
Being different is something the women of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia know all too well.	所以我们何二为一，叫Lesbor。
To be a lesbian, a dyke, a homosexual in most parts of the world, including right here in our country, India, is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice.	我觉得传统音乐就像一种叛逆， 人们可以大胆抒发他们的想法， 特别是一些来自 其他前南斯拉夫共和国的传统歌曲。
In post-conflict societies like Croatia, where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast.	战后，许多像这样的歌曲被遗失。
So enter a group of out dykes, young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Macedonia to Bosnia, from Serbia to Slovenia.	 但是它们是我们童年更是我们历史的一部分， 我们不应该把它们遗忘。
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.	不大可能般的，这个同性恋，双性恋，以及变性合唱团 向我们展示了这些女人如何 在传统上投资来创造转变， 像炼金术士一般将纠纷转变成和谐。
Many have struggled to come out to their communities, in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick, just queer.	她们的表演项目包括 克罗地亚国歌， 一首波斯尼亚爱情歌 和一些塞尔维亚对唱。
As Leah, one of the founders of the group, says, "I like traditional music very much.	Leah接着笑笑的说， Kavita, 我们对自己的圣诞音乐特别自豪， 因为它们显示了我们欢迎宗教信仰 尽管天主教会 对我们极度痛恨。
After the war, lots of these songs were lost, but they are a part of our childhood and our history, and we should not forget them."	
Improbably, this LGBT singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change, like alchemists turning discord into harmony.	她们的演唱会观众来自 她们本身的社区，这是当然的， 还有来自老的一辈 一辈可能对 同性恋存在怀疑， 但是对他们自己的传统音乐以及过去非常的怀念。
Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem, a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets.	一位父亲曾经一度阻止他的女儿 在这样一个合唱团公开她的性取向， 现在却为她们写歌。
And, Leah adds with a grin, "Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music, because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT."	在中世纪，游吟诗人 会穿越每片土地， 唱着他们的故事，分享他们的诗节。
Their concerts draw from their own communities, yes, but also from an older generation: a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality, but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.	 Lesbor像巴尔干半岛人一般的跨越不同国度， 合唱着，把那些 被宗教，国籍以及语言分离的人们连在一起，
Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given.	利比里亚长期被内乱弄得四分五裂。
The world Layma Bowie was given was a world at war.	Layma不是一位积极分子，她是三个孩子的母亲。
Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.	可是她一直不停的担忧。 她为他们的生活忧心。
Layma was not an activist, she was a mother of three.	一天晚上，她做了一个梦。
But she was sick with worry: She worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier, she worried her daughters would be raped, she worried for their lives.	她梦见她和别的成千上万的女人 结束了这场血战。
One night, she had a dream.	第二天早上在教会里，她问大家对这场内乱都怎么想。
She dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed.	大家都对这些战争感到很疲惫。
We need peace, and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace.	在Layma的朋友当中，有一位伊斯兰教女警察。
Among Layma's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.	她承诺向她的社区提起这件事情。
She promised to raise the issue with her community.	到下个星期五的布道， 那些在清真寺侧房里的女人 开始讨论她们对时势的担忧。
At the next Friday sermon, the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs.	这有什么关系？她们说，一颗子弹根本不能辨别 谁是伊斯兰教徒谁是基督教徒。
"What does it matter?"	
This small group of women, determined to bring an end to the war, and they chose to use their traditions to make a point: Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.	 而且她们决定利用她们的传统来表达她们的决心。 利比里亚女人通常穿戴 许多首饰和五颜六色的衣服。
But no, for the protest, they dressed all in white, no makeup.	可是，在抗议当中，这些妇女只穿 全身白色，没有化妆。
As Layma said, "We wore the white saying we were out for peace."	像Layma说的一般，我们穿白色 来表达我们缺乏和平的事实。
They stood on the side of the road on which Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.	她们站在 Charles Taylor的摩托车每天都经过的路旁。
They stood for weeks -- first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women -- wearing white, singing, dancing, saying they were out for peace.	她们一个星期接着一个星期的站在那， 一开始只有10个人，然后20人，然后50人，最后几百名妇女 穿着白色，唱着歌，跳着舞， 告诉大家她们需要和平。
Eventually, opposing forces in Liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.	最后，利比里亚的敌对势力 被迫在加纳举行和谈。
The peace talks dragged on and on and on.	和谈不断的被拖延。
Layma and her sisters had had enough.	Layma和她的姐妹们忍无可忍。
With their remaining funds, they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building.	她们用剩下的经费，带上 一小群妇女，来到和谈的会场， 她们把会场包围。
In a now famous CNN clip, you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.	在一个后来变得非常有名的CNN短片， 你可以看见这群妇女坐在地上，她们的手臂相连着。
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].	在印度我们把这叫做 ［印度语］。
Then things get tense.	接着事情变得激进。
The police are called in to physically remove the women.	警察被命令把这些妇女赶离现场。
As the senior officer approaches with a baton, Layma stands up with deliberation, reaches her arms up over her head, and begins, very slowly, to untie her headdress that covers her hair.	当高级警官拿着警棍向她们靠近， Layma从容地站起来， 把双手举高，越过她的头， 开始慢慢的 解开包着她头发的头巾。
You can see the policeman's face.	你可以看见那位警察的脸。
He looks embarrassed.	他感到不好意思。
He backs away.	 他开始退后。
And the next thing you know, the police have disappeared.	接着下来， 警察们消失了。
She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed, but he knew we were not going to leave.	(笑声） 她说，我不知道他退后是不是因为他相信这个传统， 不过他知道我们是不会离开的。
We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."	如果和平协议一天没有签订，我们是决不会离开的。
And the peace accord was signed.	然后和平协议最终签订了。
And the women of Liberia then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in Africa in years.	利比里亚的妇女 发起组织支持Ellen Johnson Sirleaf， 一位打破不少禁忌的女士， 成为数年来非洲 第一位当选的女国家元首。
When she made her presidential address, she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia who allowed her to win against a football star -- that's soccer for you Americans -- no less.	在她发表她的总统报告时， 她公开感谢那些勇敢的利比里亚妇女 是她们让她赢过了一位足球明星－ 对于你们美国人来说，那便是英式足球－－ 她们居然让她赢过了这位明星。
Women like Sakena and Leah and Layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind.	像Sakena和Leah一般的妇女， 还有Layma 让我感到谦虚，她们改变了我 并让我懂得我不应该那么快 的对任何人做结论。
They've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way.	她们用自己对这另类的道路的看法， 把我从我那正义的愤怒里拯救过来。
A Filipina activist once said to me, "How do you cook a rice cake?	一位菲律宾籍的积极分子告诉我， 你怎么做米饼?
With heat from the bottom and heat from the top."	用来自底部的热气和来自顶端的热气。
The protests, the marches, the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights, full stop.	这些抗议，这些游行， 永不妥协的事实是 妇女的权利是人权的基本一部分，句号。
That's the heat from the bottom.	那便是来自底部的热气。
That's Malcolm X and the suffragists and gay pride parades.	那是Malcolm X和主张妇女有权参政者 还有同性恋自豪游行。
But we also need the heat from the top.	可是我们也需要来自顶端的热气。
And in most parts of the world, that top is still controlled by men.	在这个世界的大部分角落， 顶端还是由 男人所控制。
So to paraphrase Marx: Women make change, but not in circumstances of their own choosing.	在这里释义一下Marx：妇女创造改变， 并不在她们选择的环境里。
They have to negotiate.	她们得谈判。
They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations.	她们得颠覆那些一度使她们沉默的传统 只为了能把新的抱负公诸于世。
And they need allies from their communities.	她们还需要来自她们社区的同盟，
Allies like the imam, allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in Croatia, allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away, allies like my father, who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams.	像那个伊玛目一般的盟友， 像那位开始为克罗地亚女同性恋歌唱团写新歌的父亲 一般的盟友， 像那位遵守禁忌选择后退的警察一般的盟友， 像我父亲一般的盟友， 虽然他无法帮助自己的姐姐，但是他帮助他三个女儿 去寻求她们的梦想。
Maybe this is because feminism, unlike almost every other social movement, is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor -- it's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers -- it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women, far too often, hold ourselves.	这可能是因为女权主义， 不象别的社会运动， 都反对一个明显的压迫者。 这并不是反对统治阶级， 或占据者，或殖民地者， 这是反对一些在我们女人常常 脑子里 根深蒂固的信仰和认定。
And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism, that the personal is in fact the political.	也许这就是女权主义的最有利的地方, 个人的实际上就是政治的。
So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights, the same is true of gender equality: that it starts in small places, close to home.	因此，这就跟Eleanor Roosevelt 所说的人权一样， 两性平等也如此， 它从一些小的，靠近家的地方开始。
On the streets, yes, but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends.	在街上，对， 也在厨房饭桌上的辩论 还有在婚姻的床上 以及在爱人家人的感情里 在姐妹朋友的感情里。
And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles, women like Sakena and Leah and Layma -- but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran -- are doing something else.	然后，然后， 你发现将 传统和社区与 她们的斗争联合起来， 像Sakena 和 Leah 还有 Layma的妇女， 还有在印度的Sonia Gandhi， 智利的Michelle Bachelet， 以及伊朗的Shirin Ebadi 都在做一些别的事情。
They're challenging the very notion of Western models of development.	她们正挑战这个 西方发展模式。
They are saying, we don't have to be like you to make change.	她们正用行动表明，我们并不需要像你 来创造改变。
We can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou, and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers.	我们穿莎丽或希贾布 或穿裤子或布布装， 我们同样可以成为党领导人和总统 以及人权律师。
We can use our tradition to navigate change.	我们可以用我们的传统来探索改变。
We can demilitarize societies and pour resources, instead, into reservoirs of genuine security.	我们可以使社会非军事化 取而代之，我们倒入资源 用于真正的国防。
It is in these little stories, these individual stories, that I see a radical epic being written by women around the world.	就是在这些小故事里， 这些独立的故事里， 我看到了由 世界各处的妇女撰写的一部激进的史诗。
It is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities, that I find hope.	就是在这些被 编织到一块强硬织布的， 会支持社区的线条里， 我找到了希望。
And if my heart is singing, it's because in these little fragments, every now and again, you catch a glimpse of a whole, of a whole new world.	如果我的心在歌唱， 那时因为，在这些零碎的片断里， 不时的，你会捕捉到一瞬， 能看到一个全新世界的一瞬。
And she is definitely on her way.	这个全新的世界，她正朝着我们迈进。
Thank you.	谢谢。
So it's 1995, I'm in college, and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence, Rhode Island to Portland, Oregon.	当时是95年 我在上大学 我和一个朋友开车去玩 从罗得岛的普罗旺斯区出发 到奥勒冈州的波特兰市
And you know, we're young and unemployed, so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests -- basically the longest route we can possibly take.	我们年轻，无业 于是整个旅程都在乡间小道 经过州立公园 和国家保护森林 我们尽可能绕着最长的路径
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles.	在南达科塔州之中某处 我转向我的朋友 问她一个 两千英里路途上 一直烦恼我的问题
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"	路边那个一直出现的中文字到底是什么?
My friend looks at me totally blankly.	我的朋友露出疑惑的神情
There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.	正如现在坐在第一排的这三位男士 所露出的神情一样
And I'm like, "You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them."	我说你知道的 我们一直看到的那个路牌 写着中文的那个啊
She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about.	她瞪着我的脸一阵子 突然笑开了 因为她总算知道我所指为何
And what I'm talking about is this.	我说的是这个
Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.	没错，这就是代表野餐区的那个中文字
I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us, and how we behave when that happens, and what all of this can tell us about human nature.	过去的五年 我一直在思考 刚刚我所描述的状况 为什么我们会对身边的征兆 产生误解 当误解发生时我们作何反应 以及这一切所告诉我们的人性
In other words, as you heard Chris say, I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong.	换句话说，就像 Chris 刚才说的 过去五年的时间 我都在思考错误的价值
This might strike you as a strange career move, but it actually has one great advantage: no job competition.	你可能觉得这是个奇异的专业 但有一项好处是不容置疑的： 没有竞争者。
In fact, most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong, or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong.	事实上，我们大部分的人 都尽力不思考错误的价值 或至少避免想到我们 有可能犯错。
We get it in the abstract.	我们都知道这个模糊的概念。
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.	我们都知道这里的每个人都曾经犯错
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.	人类本来就会犯错 － 没问题
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.	我们开会，去家庭旅游 去投票 全都是现在式
We go to meetings in the present tense; we go on family vacations in the present tense; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.	我们就像现在一个小泡泡里 经历人生 感觉自己总是对的
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.	于是，我今天想做的是 先谈谈为甚么我们会 陷在这种自以为是的心态中
So what I want to do today is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right.	第二是为甚么这是个问题
And second, why it's such a problem.	最后我想说服大家 克服这种感觉 是可能的 而且一旦你做到了 这将成为你道德上 智性上和创意上最大的进步
Thumbs down.	糟透了。难堪。
Okay, wonderful, great.	很糟糕，很差劲，很难堪。 谢谢你们提供这些答案 但这些答案没有回答我的问题
But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything.	让我给你一个例子
And what's funny -- at least if you're six years old -- is that the coyote's totally fine too.	这时候他才会往下掉
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air.	在我们犯错时 在我们意识到我们犯错时 我们就像那只土狼 还没意识到自己奔出悬崖
That's when he falls.	我们已经错了 已经惹上麻烦了 但仍然感觉像走在地上
When we're wrong about something -- not when we realize it, but before that -- we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.	我应该改变我之前的说法
You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground.	犯错的感觉就和 正确的感觉一样
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.	事实上我们这种自以为对的感受 是有构造性的原因的
It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right.	我称之为错误盲点
So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.	大部份的时间里 我们身体里没有任何机制 提醒我们错了 直到木已成舟
I call this error blindness.	但还有第二个理由 文化性的理由
Most of the time, we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something, until it's too late.	回想小学时代
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural.	你坐在课堂里 你的老师发回小考考卷 像这样的小考考卷
Think back for a moment to elementary school.	虽然这张不是我的
You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this.	你从小学时代 就知道该对拿这张考卷的同学 下甚么评语
This is not mine, by the way.	笨蛋，捣蛋鬼 从不做功课的坏学生
So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper.	你不过才九岁 你已经懂得，首先 那些犯错的人 都是懒惰、不负责任的傻瓜 第二 想要在人生中成功 就不要犯错
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker, the one who never does his homework.	我们很早就得到这些错误讯息
So by the time you are nine years old, you've already learned, first of all, that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all, that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes.	而我们 尤其是这个大厅里的许多人 都因此成为好学生 拿全A 完美主义、永不满意
We learn these really bad lessons really well.	不是吗？
You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.	但一旦我们发现有可能犯错 就开始手足无措
Okay, so fine.	因为依照规定 犯错 代表我们一定也有甚么不对劲
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe.	几年前 一个女人到 Beth Israel Deaconess 诊所做手术
Beth Israel's in Boston.	这个女人被送进开刀房
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard -- one of the best hospitals in the country.	麻醉，外科医生做完手术 缝合，将她送进恢复室
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.	一切看上去都很好
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.	她醒来，往自己身上一看 说为甚么我的左腿绑着绷带？
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"	他说无论如何 这位外科医生感觉 他开下的刀是在正确的一侧
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one.	我们心中时常感觉到的 理直气壮的感觉 在真实世界中 并不是个可靠的向导。
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world.	于是我们往往用同一种 思考方式去解释这些异议
But it's also a huge social problem.	如果不是这样 如果这些人和我们获得的信息一样多 却仍然不认同我们 我们便有了下一个定论 那就是他们是白痴
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.	他们已经有了所有的信息 却笨到无法拼凑出正确的图像
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality.	一旦第二个定论也不成立 当这些反对我们的人 和我们有一样的信息 又聪明 我们便有了第三个结论 他们知道事实是甚么 但却为了自己的好处 故意曲解真实。
And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you?	这真是个大灾难
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.	我们的自以为是 让我们在最需要的时候 无法预防犯错 更让我们互相仇视
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant.	对我来说 最大的悲剧是 它让我们错失了身为人的珍贵意义
They don't have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.	那就像是想象 我们的心灵之窗完全透明 我们向外观看 描述在我们之前展开的世界
When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots.	我们想要每个人和我们有一样的窗子 对世界做出一样的观察
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.	那不是真的 如果是，人生将会多么无聊
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly.	而是去理解那些你不懂的地方
But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human.	我们记得过去 思考未来 我们想象 自己成为他人，在他方
It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds.	我们的想象都有些不同 于是当我们抬头看同一个夜空 我们看到这个 这个 和这个
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.	这也是我们搞错事情的原因
That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.	在笛卡儿说出那句有名的我思故我在 的一千两百年前 圣奥古斯丁，坐下来 写下Fallor ergo sum 我错故我在
The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is.	奥古斯丁懂得 我们犯错的能力 这并不是人性中 一个令人难堪的缺陷 不是我们可以克服或消灭的
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.	这是我们的本质
We can remember the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.	因为我们不是上帝 我们不知道我们之外究竟发生了甚么
And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this.	而不同于其它动物的是 我们都疯狂地想找出解答
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.	对我来说 这种寻找的冲动 就是我们生产力和创造力的来源
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about "I think therefore I am," this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" -- "I err therefore I am."	因为一些缘故 去年我在广播上 听了很多集的我们的美国人生
Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome.	我听着听着 突然发现 这些故事全和犯错有关
It's totally fundamental to who we are.	我的第一个念头是 我完了
Because, unlike God, we don't really know what's going on out there.	我写书写疯了
And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.	四处都看到有关犯错的幻觉 说真的是这样
To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.	但几个月后 我访问了那个广播节目的主持人 Ira Glass
Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life.	我向他提到这件事 他回答我事实上
And so I'm listening and I'm listening, and at some point, I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong.	你是对的他说 我们这些工作人员总是 开玩笑说每集节目之中的 秘密主题都是一样的
And my first thought was, "I've lost it.	这个秘密主题就是 我以为这件事会这样发生 结果其它事情发生了 他说但是，这就是我们需要的
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.	我们需要这些意外 这些颠倒和错误 这些故事才能成立。
And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, "No actually, that's true.	但，故事会这样写 是因为人生就是这样
In fact," he says, "as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme.	我们以为某些事情会这样发生 发生的却是其它事
And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.	小布什以为他入侵伊拉克 会找到大规模毁灭性武器 解放中东百姓，为他们带来民主自由
And for the rest of us, audience members, as listeners, as readers, we eat this stuff up.	或许你想过 你会长大、嫁给你的初恋情人 搬回老家，生一群孩子
When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong.	无论好坏 我们创造了啦 那包围我们的世界 而世界转过头来，令我们大吃一惊
But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this.	说真的，这整个会议 充斥着这样难以置信的时刻 我们一次又一次地意识到自己的错误
And something else happened instead.	真是出人意料之外啊，不是吗
And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.	我的逃生火箭在哪，Chris?
And something else happened instead.	于是我们又在这里
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.	事情就是这样
And something else happened instead.	我们重新想出其它点子
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize.	我们有了新的故事
And something else happened instead.	我们开了另一个会议
I mean, this is life.	这次的主题是 如果你还没有听到耳朵出油的话 是重新找到想象的力量
For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us.	对我来说 如果你真的想重新找到想象的力量 你需要离开 那个小小的、自我感觉良好的小圈圈 看看彼此 看看宇宙的 广大无垠 复杂神秘 然后真正地说 哇，我不知道
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- TED 1998 -- eh.	1998年 身为一个有四个孩子的单亲妈妈 生下第四个孩子还不过三个月 我找到一份 研究助理的工作
Didn't really work out that way, did it?	我去了利比里亚北部
Where's my jet pack, Chris?	作为工作的一部分 当地村庄会提供住宿
So here we are again.	我被安排与一位单亲妈妈 和她的女儿住在一起
And that's how it goes.	那个女孩子正巧是 全村唯一一个 读到九年级的 女孩
We come up with another idea.	她是村里人的笑柄
We tell another story.	其他女人常常对她母亲说  你和你的孩子 注定穷一辈子。
We hold another conference.	我在这个村庄工作了两个星期 到了回家的时候
The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder.	这位母亲来到我面前，跪了下来 然后说；莱伊曼，带我女儿走。
Maybe I'm wrong."	我流着泪说： 不行。
Thank you.	两个月后， 我去了另一个村庄 做同样的工作 他们安排我和村长一起住
Thank you guys.	这个女村长带着一个小女孩 和我一样也是混血的 全身脏兮兮的
Many times I go around the world to speak, and people ask me questions about the challenges, my moments, some of my regrets.	她整天不论去哪 都只穿着内衣
I went to Northern Liberia.	这个名字的意思是猪
This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade.	我给她买二手衣服 和她的第一个玩具娃娃
After two weeks of working in that village, it was time to go back.	我想上学
The mother came to me, knelt down, and said, "Leymah, take my daughter.	一贫如洗 和父母住在一起 我还是只能说：不行。
With tears in my eyes, I said, "No."	这个小女孩的情况是 她被她的祖父 强暴了 整整六个月，日复一日
The women's chief of the village has this little girl, fair color like me, totally dirty.	她躺在我身边 说，阿姨，我希望一切会变好
When I asked, "Who is that?"	她十九岁，她的梦想是上大学 并有能力培养她的兄弟姐妹
Her mother died while giving birth to her, and no one had any idea who her father was."	她去学校的第一天
For two weeks, she became my companion, slept with me.	学校的体育主任 把她招到这个专业项目的负责人 把她叫出教室
I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll.	在接下来的三年里 她的命运是 每天都与他发生性关系 作为让她进学校的报答
The night before I left, she came to the room and said, "Leymah, don't leave me here.	在世界各地，我们有各种政策 各种国际组织 各项工作的领导者
I wish to go with you.	伟大的人物许下诺言—— 我们会保护我们的儿童 远离贫困，远离恐惧
I wish to go to school."	联合国有《儿童权利公约》
Dirt poor, no money, living with my parents, I again said, "No."	在美国，我们知道有《有教无类法》之类的条文
Till today, I have no idea where those two girls are.	比如说，在利比里亚 少女怀孕率 是十分之三
The story of this little girl: She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months.	年仅十二岁的女孩出卖自己的身体 一个晚上赚不到一美元
She came to me bloated, very pale.	这令人痛心，令人悲伤
She'd lie beside me and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.	光提这些，不足以说明鸿沟有多深 利比里亚共和国有两位诺贝尔奖得主 他们也有那么多的少女妈妈 毫无希望，或者看起来毫无希望
I wish to go to school."	我们创造了一个空间 叫做年轻女孩改造计划
2010: A young woman stands before President Sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together, their father and mother died during the war.	我们到农村社区里去 而我们所做的，就像我们在这儿做的事一样 是创造空间
She's highly athletic.	其中的一些 走进房间时非常害羞的女孩 已经大胆地迈出脚步，像那些年轻妈妈们， 挺身而出 为其他年轻女性争取权利
One of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship.	我遇到过一个年轻女性 十几岁时就有了四个孩子 从没想过读完高中 结果顺利毕业了 从没想过上大学 结果被录取了
She gets it.	她住在一个无法让她 赚够钱上学的地方
Her dream of going to school, her wish of being educated, is finally here.	她卖水，卖软饮料 卖手机充值卡
She goes to school on the first day.	你们可能会认为她会把这些钱 拿回来当她自己的教育基金
The director of sports who's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class.	她的名字是胡安尼塔
And for the next three years, her fate will be having sex with him every day, as a favor for getting her in school.	她带着这些钱 找到她社区里的单亲妈妈 让她们重返校园
Globally, we have policies, international instruments, work leaders.	她说，莱伊曼，我的愿望 是接受教育
Countries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind.	这就是这位非洲女孩的梦想
Other countries come with different things.	几年前 有一个非洲女孩
There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls.	这个女孩有个儿子 他想要一块甜甜圈 因为他饿到了极点
All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally, I think, has failed.	愤怒，沮丧 不安 带着对她的社会 和她的孩子现状的不满 这个年轻女孩发起了一个活动 一项由普通女性 团结起来 共建和平的活动
In one community, we're told, you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper.	在其他年轻女性脑海里有着这些的想法—— 我失败了，我失败了，我失败了
And then someone asked me, just before my TEDTalk, a few days ago, "So where is the hope?"	今天，这个年轻女性就是我 一个诺贝尔奖获得者
It's not enough to say you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia when your girls' kids are totally out there and no hope, or seemingly no hope.	我们提供四年全额奖学金 给那些来自农村的，我们认为有潜力的女孩
We go into rural communities and all we do, like has been done in this room, is create the space.	你们会和我一起上路 去帮助那个女孩 不论她是非洲女孩，美国女孩 还是日本女孩 实现她的愿望 实现她的梦想 达成那个梦想吗？
When these girls sit, you unlock intelligence, you unlock passion, you unlock commitment, you unlock focus, you unlock great leaders.	正因为这些 我们这些天 交谈过和看到的 伟大的改革者和创新者 现在也坐在 世界的各个角落 而他们要求我们做的 就是创造一个空间 来释放智慧 释放激情 释放她们内在的 伟大潜能
Today, we've worked with over 300.	让我们同行，让我们同行
One young woman I met, teen mother of four, never thought about finishing high school, graduated successfully; never thought about going to college, enrolled in college.	现在在利比里亚 你认为 最棘手的是什么问题
One day she said to me, "My wish is to finish college and be able to support my children."	莱伊曼·古博薇：我被安排去领导 利比里亚调停协议的进行
She's at a place where she can't find money to go to school.	我的工作之一 就是前往 各个村庄和城镇—— 在泥路上奔波13, 15小时—— 在我去的每一个社区 我都看到聪明的女孩
Juanita is her name.	所以困扰我的 是我曾身在那样的地方 而现在我却站在这个讲台上 我不希望自己是唯一一个 能站在这个讲台上的女孩
She takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school.	我正在寻找 让其他女孩像我一样站在这里的方法
Says, "Leymah, my wish is to be educated.	我希望在二十年后回首时 我们会看到另一个利比里亚女孩 加纳女孩，尼日利亚女孩，埃塞俄比亚女孩 站在TED讲台上

I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop."	克里斯·安德森：以去年来说， 请你告诉我们一件 你亲眼目睹的，令人充满希望的事
This is the dream of the African girl.	莱伊曼·古博薇：我可以告诉你们许多我亲眼目睹的 振奋人心的事
Several years ago, there was one African girl.	但是去年 我们去当瑟利夫总统的故乡，她的村子 我们去那儿帮助这些女孩
This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry.	我们看到只有不到25个女孩 在上高中
Angry, frustrated, really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children, this young girl started a movement, a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace.	其他女孩都去金矿上 她们主要是去卖淫 或者做其他工作
I will fulfill the wish.	我们带回了50个女孩 给她们提供帮助
This is another African girl's wish.	当时是在选举的初期
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.	这是一个女性从来都不 连年长的女性也是 几乎不公开和男人坐在一起
So I will do this.	她们活动的主题是 连漂亮女孩也要投票。
Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true, the wish of peace came true.	他说，强暴并不野蛮，但这个法律是野蛮的
She went to school.	他现在已经下台了。
This young woman wished for other things to happen, it happened for her.	克里斯·安德森：莱伊曼，谢谢。 非常感谢你来到TED。
Today, this young woman is me, a Nobel laureate.	莱伊曼·古博薇：不用谢。
I'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish, in my tiny capacity, of little African girls -- the wish of being educated.	今天我想来探讨一下 这些为我们制造日常用品的人们： 例如我们的鞋子，手提包，电脑，还有手机。
We set up a foundation.	这个话题时常让我们觉得很内疚。
I've also been to places in this U.S., and I know that girls in this country also have wishes, a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx, a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A., a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas, a wish for a better life somewhere in New York, a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey.	我们，是全球化的受益者， 可每笔交易却似乎都是在剥削那些受害者， 而这种不公平 似乎也深深烙印在这些产品之中。
Will you journey with me to help that girl, be it an African girl or an American girl or a Japanese girl, fulfill her wish, fulfill her dream, achieve that dream?	总而言之，这个世界到底怎么了？ 一个在组装iphone生产线上的员工却买不起一台iphone？
Because all of these great innovators and inventors that we've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world, and all they're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence, unlock the passion, unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves.	人们理所当然地认为，中国的工厂就是应该被压榨的， 因为我们渴求便宜的产品 造成了这样的局面。
LG: I've been asked to lead the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative.	事实上，中国制造的产品遍布全球， 也包括他们自己的市场，这要归结于许多因素的综合： 低成本，大量受过教育的劳动力， 还有有弹性的工作制度 这些都快速地迎合了市场的需求。
As part of my work, I'm doing these tours in different villages and towns -- 13, 15 hours on dirt roads -- and there is no community that I've gone into that I haven't seen intelligent girls.	我们因为太专注于我们自身和产品上， 所以忽视了产业链另一端的个体的存在 将他们看成是可以随时被替换的，微小的 像手机零件那样。
But sadly, the vision of a great future, or the dream of a great future, is just a dream, because you have all of these vices.	中国工人并不是因为我们对于iPods的无限渴求 而被迫进入工厂的。
Teen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.	他们选择离乡背井，是为了赚钱， 为了学习新的技能，以及为了看看这个世界。
So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place, and I just don't want to be the only one at this place.	在对全球化发展趋势的辩论中 我们缺失的，是聆听工人们自己的声音。
I'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me.	以下就是一些例子。
I want to look back 20 years from now and see that there's another Liberian girl, Ghanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl standing on this TED stage.	包永秀说：我妈妈让我回家结婚 但是如果我还没有让自己得到充分的发展 就结婚，我只能嫁给一个平凡的工人， 所以我根本不着急。
And maybe, just maybe, saying, "Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today."	陈颖说：我过年回家的时候 每个人都说我变了，他们问我： 你怎么会有这么大的改变？
So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope.	我告诉他们，我很努力地学习和工作， 即便你想给他们讲更多，他们反正也不能理解。
But I'm also not pessimistic, because I know it doesn't take a lot to get them charged up.	吴春明： 即使我赚了很多钱 也无法满足我自己。
And in the last year, tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening.	赚钱并不是生活全部的意义。
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.	肖金说： 现在我下班以后，就会去学英语 因为在不久的将来，我们的客户将不仅仅是中国人， 所以，我们需要学习更多的语言。
But in the last year, where President Sirleaf comes from, her village, we went there to work with these girls.	以上的话，都是出自一些年轻女孩的口， 她们仅仅18、19岁。
And we could not find 25 girls in high school.	因此，我花了两年时间去了解流水工作线上的工人们 例如在中国南部的一个工业城市——东莞。
All of these girls went to the gold mine, and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things.	有一些主要的问题不断的重复着： 他们到底赚了多少钱， 她们想要嫁给怎样的人， 他们是否想要跳槽 还是留在一个工厂内。
We took 50 of those girls and we worked with them.	另一些话题，则几乎不被提起 例如：在我眼中如牢狱般的生活条件 10-15个工人住在一个房间里， 50个人公用一个厕所， 日以继夜地按照工厂的要求来作息。
And this was at the beginning of elections.	他们每一个人都知道，即便是住在如此的环境里面 也会比他们在中国农村的老家的条件 好得多
This is one place where women were never -- even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men.	工人们很少谈论他们制造的产品， 他们往往很难解释清楚 他们到底做了什么。
These girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration.	我访问了吕清民 这个年轻的女孩是我最了解的， 我问她她在工厂里到底从事什么工作 她用中文告诉我，听起来像是 秋西。
And the theme they used was: "Even pretty girls vote."	很久以后，我才知道她说的是 QC，也就是质量监控。
They were able to mobilize young women.	她竟然都不能告诉我她在工厂里做的是什么。
But not only did they do that, they went to those who were running for seats to ask them, "What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win?"	她能做的就只是模仿一个英文缩写的发音 而这个语言是她根本就不懂的。
And one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws, and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric.	马克思认为这就是资本主义的悲哀 疏远了工人与他们所制造的产品。
Rape is not barbaric, but the law, he said, was barbaric.	与传统的鞋匠或者木匠不同， 工人在工厂没有控制权， 在她所做的工作中，没有快乐， 没有真正的满足或理解。
And when the girls started engaging him, he was very hostile towards them.	但同许多马克思 坐在英国图书馆的阅读室里想出来理论一样， 这一点，他错了。
These little girls turned to him and said, "We will vote you out of office."	仅仅因为一个人用她的时间 去制造一件物品，并不代表 她就变成了这件物品。
He's out of office today.	她用她赚的钱去做了什么 她在那个地方学到了什么技能，以及她如何被改变 这些才是重要的。
Leymah, thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED.	一个工厂制造什么并非重点， 工人们也不在乎谁买了他们制造的产品。
LG: You're welcome.	记者报道了关于中国工厂的新闻 另一方面，也强调了 工人与产品之间的联系。
Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day: our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.	很多文章都在计算： 这些工人要工作多久，赚来的钱 才够买一件他们制作的产品？
Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.	举个例子，一个初级组装生产线的工人 在中国组装iPhone配件 要倾其2个半月的工资才能买一台iPhone。
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes, or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your iPad.	但说真的，这些计算有任何意义吗？
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make, and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves.	再举个例子，我最近写了一篇文章 登在纽约客杂志上， 但是也供不起我在杂志上登一个广告。
After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?	但是，谁在乎？我不需要在纽约客上登广告 其实，大部分的工人，也不是真的需要iPhone。
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways.	大概在我遇到陆青敏，也就是小敏的一年后 她邀请我去她农村的家做客 过春节。
In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world, including its own, thanks to a combination of factors: its low costs, its large and educated workforce, and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands.	在回家的火车上，她给了我一个礼物： 一个棕色皮质的Coach牌零钱包。
By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets, we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone.	我谢了她，虽然我很自然地认为这应该是个山寨的产品， 就好像东莞在出售的大部分产品一样。
Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods.	回家以后，小敏给了她妈妈另一个礼物： 一个Dooney &amp;amp; Bourke牌的粉色手提包， 几天以后，她的姐姐正在展示 一个红褐色的LeSportsac单肩包。
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money, to learn new skills, and to see the world.	慢慢地，我好想明白了 这些东西都是她们工厂生产的 每一件东西，都是正品
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.	小敏的姐姐告诉她父母 在美国，这个包要卖320美金。
Here are a few.	她的农民父母看了看，无言以对。
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker, so I'm not in a rush."	还有，Coach正在推出一系列新产品2191 她说：这个好像要卖6000。
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year, everyone said I had changed. They asked me, what did you do that you have changed so much?	她停顿了一下：我不知道是6000人民币，还是 6000美元，无论如何都是6000啦。
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them more, they won't understand anyway."	
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money, it won't satisfy me.	小敏姐姐的男友也回到家 与她一起过年， 他说：看起来不值这么多钱。
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life."	
Xiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English, because in the future, our customers won't be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."	小敏的姐姐对他说：有的人 就是懂这些东西，你懂啥。
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women, 18 or 19 years old.	在小敏的世界里，Coach包包有一个很奇怪的价值。
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.	它们虽然不是一文不值，但是相比起它们的实际价值 还是相差甚远，因为她们所结识的人里面 几乎没有人想要买，也没有人知道这值多少钱。
Certain subjects came up over and over: how much money they made, what kind of husband they hoped to marry, whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were.	有一次，小敏大姐的一个朋友结婚 她带着一个手提包作为给新人的礼物。
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances, and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China.	1941年那些表皮磨光的 美国棒球手套 启发了Coach的创始人 促使其研发了一个新系列的手提包： 奢华、柔软的的表面和手套的皮质一样。
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made, and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did.	6名技巧纯熟的皮革工人制造12只经典款手提包 他们有着精准而快速的手艺。
When I asked Lu Qingmin, the young woman I got to know best, what exactly she did on the factory floor, she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like "qiu xi."	这些手提包新颖，具有相当的功能性，世界各地的女人都喜欢 一个新的美国经典诞生了。
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying "QC," or quality control.	
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand.	我想知道马克思是否会被小敏 和她的姐妹所影响。
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism, the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.	她们与产品之间的关系 更复杂、惊奇而且有趣 这都超出他的想象。
Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets, the worker in an industrial factory has no control, no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work.	但是，他对这个世界的观点没变，而我们却将 这些工人们看成是一群上不了台面的群体， 想象一下，假如我们可以了解工人们的真实想法。
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum, he got this one wrong.	我第一次见到小敏的时候，她刚满18岁 她刚刚辞去在一家电子设备工厂的 组装生产线的工作。
Just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that, a piece of something.	接下来的两年，我看着她换了5次工作， 最后固定在一个比较赚钱的职位 是在一个硬件工厂的采购部门。
What she does with the money she earns, what she learns in that place, and how it changes her, these are the things that matter.	不久，她嫁给了一个打工仔， 然后移居到了他的村子， 生了两个女儿， 他们存够了钱给她买了一辆二手别克车 给她的父母买了房子。
What a factory makes is never the point, and the workers could not care less who buys their products.	最近她独自回到东莞 在一个起重机工厂里找了份工作， 暂时与她村里的丈夫和孩子 分居两地。
For example, I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine, but I can't afford to buy an ad in it.	他们其中很少有人 愿意回到过去的生活。
But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker, and most of these workers don't really want iPhones.	我第一次去东莞的时候，我很担心 担心与工人相处的时间会很压抑沮丧。
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min, she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year.	通过向我展示她们的生活， 她们教给我很多关于工厂 关于中国，以及如何生存在这个世界的道理。
On the train home, she gave me a present: a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.	这就是小敏在回家的火车上 送给我的Coach钱包。
I thanked her, assuming it was fake, like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.	我一直保存着它，由此提醒着我与这些 我记录过的年轻女生的联系， 这些并不是因为经济而是因为个人情感的联系， 价值并不是在于金钱而是记忆。
After we got home, Min gave her mother another present: a pink Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag, and a few nights later, her sister was showing off a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.	这个钱包也是一个提醒， 你坐在办公室或图书馆里时所想象的东西 和你走出去真正接触的东西 并不一样。
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory, and every single one of them was authentic.	谢谢。
Min's sister said to her parents, "In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."	谢谢，Leslie，真的很有见地 我们中很多人从未这么思考过。
"And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line, 2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."	是的，一分钟。
She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or 6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000."	你们知道吗，那些工人们真正启发我的 是他们的自我激励、自我推进 还有足智多谋，都深深警醒着我 他们最想要的是教育，是学习 只是因为他们大部分有着穷困的家庭背景。
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her for the new year, said, "It doesn't look like it's worth that much."	他们通常中学就离开学校了。
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually understand these things.	他们的父母大都是文盲， 他们独自来到城市打拼 晚上或者周末，他们去学习电脑的课程， 或者是学英语， 就是学一些真的非常非常基本的东西，你知道吗？
You don't understand shit."	 例如如何在Word里面打字 或者用英语讲一些简单的事情。
In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.	所以，如果你们想要帮助那些工人 开展一些小型、集中、基础的课程 这会带来的结果就是 你的工人得到了提升， 但是希望，他们也会晋升到Apple更高的职位中 你可以帮助他们适应社会流动性 帮助他们得到自我的提升。
Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married, she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.	我想要一间更好的房间，想要一个电视
Another time, after Min had already left the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit, bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.	我的意思是，有这些东西固然很好 但是他们来到这个城市不是为了这些， 而且他们根本不在乎。
I looked in the zippered pocket of one, and I found a printed card in English, which read, "An American classic.	他们有没有说过 生活环境真的很艰苦，或者是 自我得到提升以后，这些东西 也会得到相应改善？
In 1941, the burnished patina of an all-American baseball glove inspired the founder of Coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.	当然，当然了。
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.	我是说，大家都知道 这其实很有趣，我花了大概2年时间 在东莞生活 在这个时间里面，你可以看到每个人的生活 都在起着巨大的变化：变得更好，变坏，或者偏离轨道 但总体来说，都是在进步的。
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere adored them. A new American classic was born."	只要你花足够的时间，就会变好 如果一个人十年前来到城市 现在应该已经成为城市的中层阶级， 所以总体趋势一定是变好的。
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters.	只不过你初入城市的时候 一下子还无法感知。
Their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated, surprising and funny than he could have imagined.	看起来好像每个人都很穷 很失落，但这都不是真实的。
And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses, to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.	可以肯定，工厂的环境十分艰苦 在坐的你我都不会愿意前往， 但是比起他们所来自的地方，站在工人的角度来看 这都是值得的，他们也希望 所去的地方这些都会得到改善，我只想 把他们所想的东西陈述出来 而这些并不等同于你们所认定的东西。
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory.	感谢你的演讲。
Later, she married a fellow migrant worker, moved with him to his village, gave birth to two daughters, and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick for herself and an apartment for her parents.	我们终将消逝，它们则万世长存 我们只有一世, 它们却有许多 而且每一世都有不同的意义
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes, temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village.	这就意味着，我们只能写一次传记 而它们却可以写很多次
In a recent email to me, she explained, "A person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."	今早，我想谈谈 一件特殊的文物身上的故事，它的传记 它每一世的传记 这是件非凡的文物
Together, they make up the largest migration in history, and it is globalization, this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think.	用陶土制成 先做成一个 圆柱的形状 刻满楔形文字后 再在阳光下烘干
Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be.	你可以看到 它上面有破损的痕迹 这并不奇怪 因为它已有超过2500年的历史了 它是在1879年 被挖掘出来的
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.	但是今天 我相信 它在中东地区的政治领域 也扮演着重要的角色
I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them, or that they would have nothing to say to me.	在它身上 发生了很多精彩的故事 有些故事到现在也没有完结
Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous.	故事始于 两伊战争 以及随后一系列的事件 累积起来 针对伊拉克的 外国武装的入侵 暴君被推翻 政局发生骤变
By opening up their lives to me, they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world.	我想从 那一系列事件中的一个章节开始说起 你们中的大多数对此不会陌生 那就是伯萨沙王的宴会 因为我们说的这场两伊战争 发生在公元前539年
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me on the train home to visit her family.	而公元前539年 和2003年发生的事件 两者之间有 惊人的相似之处
I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women I wrote about, ties that are not economic but personal in nature, measured not in money but in memories.	你现在看到的是伦勃朗的油画作品 现陈列于伦敦的国家美术馆 这幅画阐释了希伯来圣经中的 但以理书
Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight that a lot of us haven't had before.	不仅仅是犹太人，他还带回了圣殿的器皿
But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say, with Apple's head of manufacturing, what would you say?	他将圣殿洗劫一空，还亵渎了神明
Leslie Chang: One minute?	来自耶路撒冷圣殿中的金制器皿 被带回了巴比伦
One minute.	他的儿子伯萨沙 决定举办一场盛宴
LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven, resourceful, and the thing that struck me, what they want most is education, to learn, because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.	为了让宴会更加刺激 他又加了点亵渎神灵的余兴节目 他拿出了圣殿器皿
They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.	那时他已与伊朗人开战 和波斯国王也打得不可开交
Their parents are often illiterate, and then they come to the city, and they, on their own, at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class, they'll take an English class, and learn really, really rudimentary things, you know, like how to type a document in Word, or how to say really simple things in English.	那天晚上，但以理告诉我们 在宴会达到高潮时 出现了一只手在墙上写字 你被称在天平里，显出你的亏欠 你的国分裂 归与玛代人和波斯人
When you talk to workers, that's what they want.	这是个精彩的故事，我们都知道
They do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.	墙上之字 这个说法 已经成为我们的日常用语
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."	而接下来发生了 一件意义重大的事情 赛鲁士圆柱也在 此时出现而来
I mean, it would be nice to have those things, but that's not why they're in the city, and that's not what they care about.	波斯国王赛鲁士 不费一兵一卒就进入了巴比伦 而伟大的巴比伦帝国 国土从伊拉克中南部 一直延伸到地中海 却落于赛鲁士之手
Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth, that things over time were getting better?	接着赛鲁士发表了声明
I mean, you know, it was interesting, because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city, Dongguan, and over that time, you could see immense change in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways, but generally upward.	在包围巴比伦时 有巴比伦语这样写道 他说：我是赛鲁士，是整个宇宙的王 我是伟大的国王，是强盛的国王 我是巴比伦的国王，是世界之王
It looks like everyone's poor and desperate, but that's not really how it is.	那么这位伟大而强盛的 世界之王打算做些什么呢
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough, and it's nothing you or I would want to do, but from their perspective, where they're coming from is much worse, and where they're going is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give that context of what's going on in their minds, not what necessarily is going on in yours.	他接着说，征服巴比伦之后 他会立即让所有 被尼布甲尼撒和伯萨沙 俘虏和奴役的不同种族的人 获得自由
Thanks so much for your talk.	他会让他们回到自己的国家
Thank you very much.	更重要的是 他会让他们恢复信仰 并拿回 缴获的雕像 和圣殿器皿
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us.	所有受到巴比伦人压迫 和被掳至巴比伦的人都将回家 他们将与他们的神一同回去
We perish, they survive; we have one life, they have many lives, and in each life they can mean different things.	他们可以修复他们的祭坛 并以他们自己的方式 在属于他们的地方，祭拜他们的神
Which means that, while we all have one biography, they have many.	这是就是当时颁布的法令 赛鲁士圆柱就是证据 证明了犹太人 被流放到巴比伦之后 好多年，他们都会坐在巴比伦的水畔 一想起耶路撒冷就会哭泣 那些犹太人被准许回家了
I want this morning to talk about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies -- of one particular object, one remarkable thing.	他们被允许回到耶路撒冷 重建神庙
It doesn't, I agree, look very much.	这在犹太历史上 是一份核心文件
It's about the size of a rugby ball.	在希伯来圣经里的历代志和以斯拉记中 也清楚的记载着
It's made of clay, and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape, covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun.	下面是关于同一个故事的 犹太版本
And as you can see, it's been knocked about a bit, which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879.	因此，波斯国王赛鲁士说 上天的神耶和华天下万国赐给我， 又嘱咐我 在犹大的耶路撒冷为他建造一座殿宇
But today, this thing is, I believe, a major player in the politics of the Middle East.	你们中间凡是作为他的子民的
And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet.	愿上帝与这人同在 你们要回归耶路撒冷建造他的神殿 回归耶路撒冷
The story begins in the Iran-Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces, the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change.	这里的核心要素 仍然是回归 这也是犹太教教义的 核心部分
And I want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with, Belshazzar's feast -- because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war of 539 BC.	你们知道，结束流放回到耶路撒冷 和第二神殿 重塑了犹太教
And the parallels between the events of 539 BC and 2003 and in between are startling.	那次改变 那个伟大的历史时刻 是由波斯国王赛鲁士实现的 这一切在希伯来圣经中都有记载 也用巴比伦语刻在赛鲁士圆柱上
What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting, now in the National Gallery in London, illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures.	这是两篇伟大的文献 那么政治上又如何呢
And you all know roughly the story.	那时所发生的事 是中东历史上一个根本性的转变
Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon.	伊朗，米底和波斯帝国 被赛鲁士统一 成为第一个伟大的世界帝国
Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.	赛鲁士于公元前530年左右开始统治
Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast.	在那个时期，它是世界上最大的帝国
And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels.	更重要的是 它是第一个 规模如此宏大的 多文化，多信仰的国家
He's already at war with the Iranians, with the king of Persia.	所以必须采用新的方法来治理这个帝国
And that night, Daniel tells us, at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall, "You are weighed in the balance and found wanting, and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians."	必须采用多语言的治理方式
And that very night Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.	其实巴比伦语版本的法令说明了这一点
It is, of course, a great moment in the history of the Jewish people.	还必须认识到人民的不同习俗 不同民族，不同宗教和不同信仰
It's a great story. It's story we all know.	所有这一切都受到赛鲁士的尊重
Cyrus, king of the Persians, has entered Babylon without a fight -- the great empire of Babylon, which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean, falls to Cyrus.	它给中东的统一留下了一个梦 即不同信仰的人们 能够和平共处
And Cyrus makes a declaration.	然而希腊的入侵结束了这一切
In ringing Babylonian -- it was written in Babylonian -- he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe, the great king, the powerful king, king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."	希腊历史学家色诺芬 在他所著的《赛鲁士的教育》一书中 认为赛鲁士是一位伟大的统治者
And it's written, as we'll see in due course, by very skilled P.R. consultants.	在亚历山大大帝建立新的国家之后 巴比伦开始衰落，化为一片废墟 所有关于伟大的巴比伦帝国的痕迹都遗落了 直到1879年 大英博物馆为了寻找展品 在巴比伦挖出赛鲁士圆柱为止
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising.	现在它又引发了另一个故事
And what is the great king, the powerful king, the king of the four quarters of the world going to do?	它引发了19世纪中期 那场伟大的辩论 圣经可靠么？我们能够相信它么？
He'll let them return to their countries.	博士的话有点刺耳。
And more important, he will let them all recover the gods, the statues, the temple vessels that had been confiscated.	“是的，舅妈，”伊丽莎白说，“可是这次不是碰巧分开的，都怨那年轻人爱管闲事的朋友，是他们把简和彬格莱先生拆开的。
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home, and they'll take with them their gods.	我相信，彬格莱先生狂热地爱着她。”
And they'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way, in their own place.	“他的头被绳套向后拉得抬起来，这样他就使不上力气，”妇女接下去说。
This is the decree, this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews, after the exile in Babylon, the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon, weeping when they remembered Jerusalem, those Jews were allowed to go home.	“如果你卸下绳套，我肯定他能干好。”
And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms.	萨拉很吃惊的发现，她已和韦恩共处一室了。
This is the Jewish version of the same story.	太不成体统了——虽然她感到韦恩身上有种奇特的吸引力。
"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia, 'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem.	我大胆地改正了它，当然我这样改变是有道理的；因为当你已上到两层楼时，如果你把你的楼房增高三层，总共就造了五层，比应该有的多了两层，这样上面的房间则更多地暴露于风雨之中；除此之外，恐怕地基也难以承受，除非你真的是用那些如此轻的材料诸如稻草和头发去建造，但你知道那是经不住火的。
The Lord God be with him, and let him go up.'"	“是啊，可是你可以喝一点啊！”
"Go up" -- aaleh.	老人回答，“我喝这水喝了十五年了。”
The central element, still, of the notion of return, a central part of the life of Judaism.	“这是我的错，”我对他说。
As you all know, that return from exile, the second temple, reshaped Judaism.	“这一下假期算完了，但总比命没了好！”
And that change, that great historic moment, was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia, reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay.	“你！”毛虫很不友好地说。“你是谁？”
Two great texts, what about the politics?	“我这边的人也把我扔出来了……我说，这可不象是家正经客栈，是吧？”
What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.	“我记起来了。”
The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians, united under Cyrus, became the first great world empire.	“你希望画像会变老，你会永远年轻。
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.	出了教堂，穿过广场时，他碰上一个急急忙忙往教堂赶来的姑娘。
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.	她看到他时，脸上的焦急变成了恐惧。
Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale.	“请您，德北夫人，请您告诉我她在哪儿！请您对一个可怜又孤独的男人仁慈一点吧！”
And it had to be run in a quite new way.	在瑞福洛，西拉斯把自己关在小草屋里。
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.	他不明白为什么上帝拒绝帮助他。
Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.	从此，他要开始生活在一个黑暗的、没有爱也没有希望的世界里。
And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen, and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander.	晚饭后布莱姆雷夫人和客人在吸烟室坐着。
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit, and a unit where people of different faiths could live together.	每人都默不出声地焦急地待着，没人想玩牌。
And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented.	他们把厨房的窗户像往常一样给托博莫里开着，但是他没有回来。
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central.	17
The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book "Cyropaedia" promoting Cyrus as the great ruler.	“胡说！”汉普顿先生叫嚷道。“你把我亲爱的妻子变成了狼，现在你必须将她再变回来！”
And throughout European culture afterward, Cyrus remained the model.	戈弗雷脸色惨白，有些颤抖。
After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.	他早晚会发现真相，因为莫丽说会来告诉他。
And it enters now another story.	她希望每个人都知道我们结婚了。等父亲知道了，你就别想再从我这儿弄一分钱！”
It enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century: Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?	“还有什么？”
We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures.	她问道。
But the lawyer did not want to talk about Doctor Lanyon.	马车终于套好了。
'You know I've never agreed with your will,'he continued.	因路况很差，马车在以往的四匹马之外又加了两匹。
'You've told me often enough,'said his friend sharply.	马打着滑，气喘吁吁地，车夫只得不停地挥动手中的长鞭。
'Yes, aunt,'said Elizabeth,'but in this case it was not chance,but the young man's interfering friends,who separated Jane and Mr Bingley.	“别问来问去，”三月兔生气了。
I'm sure he was violently in love with her.'	“你现在得给我们讲个故事。”
'He can't use all his strength when his head is held back with that bearing rein,'the woman went on.	“先生，我是律师。
'If you take it off,I'm sure he'll do better.'	我有文件在此证明十五年前你在西印度群岛和伯莎，梅森结了婚。”
'said the Caterpillar,in a very unfriendly voice.	关于那封信，他只字未提。
'Who are you?'	他宽恕她了吗？每天早晚，他都一如既往，终于，他们结婚的喜日子到了。
'My man's thrown me out,too…I say,this isn't a very good hotel,is it? '…	她稍稍平静了一点，便问：“门关着吗？”
'I remember,yes,'said Basil.	弗内斯勋爵夫人看着王子笑了。
'You wished that the picture could become old,and that you could stay young.But this…'He stared again at the picture. 'This is impossible.And you told me that you'd destroyed the picture.'	“我不知道，殿下，”她说，“我不知道。”
When he got outside and crossed the square,he met a girl hurrying towards the church.	她看到那些人还在疯狂地跳着舞，不像就要回去的样子，于是变得焦急起来。
When she saw him,the anxiety on her face changed to terror.	她又一次看到了亚历克，他正等在门口，雪茄烟在黑暗中闪烁着红光。
At Raveloe,Silas shut himself away in his cottage.He did not want to think about the disaster he had experienced.He could not understand why God had refused to help him.But now that his trust in God and his friends had been broken, he did not feel strong enough to build up that trust again,in a new church and with new friends.From now on,he would live in a dark,loveless,hopeless world.	但是过了一会儿，她卷入了一场争吵中，正极力想从愤怒的人群中脱开身时，亚历克骑着马过来了。他叫她坐在他的马背上，要带她回去。
After dinner the Blemleys and their guests sat in the smoking－room.Everyone was quiet and worried and nobodywanted to play cards.At eleven o'clock the cook and the housekeeper went to bed.They left the kitchen window openfor Tobermory as usual,but he did not come.	她犹豫了一下，同意了。
17	他看了看她那双细嫩的手和有些苍白的脸。
'Rubbish! 'shouted Mr Hampton.	我回头瞟了一眼。
'You changed my dear wife into a wolf.	警车和我们只隔一两个路口——正朝这边开过来。
Godfrey's face was white now,and he was trembling.	我的妈妈在门边气愤地喊着。
'Look,Dunstan,I've nearly had enough of this.You can push a man too far,you know.Perhaps I'll go to the Squire now and confess everything to him.He'll discover the truth one day,because Molly says she'll come and tell him.She wants every－one to know we re married.When the Squire knows the truth,you won't get any more money from me!'	“是她照顾我的母亲老德姆代克。”
I decided to keep a rowing boat near our rooms,so that Her－bert or I could row up and down the river,as far as Clara's house.If Magwitch saw us on the river,he could draw his bedroom curtain to show everything was all right.	不到三分钟我就轻而易举地驾着伊斯帕尼奥拉号沿着金银岛顺风而行了。然后我下去找到一条手帕，帮助汉兹包扎他腿上鲜血直流的伤口。
At last the coach was ready.It was drawn by a team of six horses instead of the usual four,because of the bad state of the roads.The roads were very bad indeed.The horses slipped and panted,and the driver had to use his whip incessantly.	他吃了一点东西，又喝了不少酒，看起来比刚才好多了。
'Don't ask questions,'said the March Hare crossly.	“不会好了……
'You must tell us a story now.'	我想。”
It seemed to be a number code,where groups of numbers replace letters.	“我们订什么计划都无关紧要了。”
I worked on the words,because you can use a word as a key in a number code.	我说，“还没等我们到国王身边他就已经死了。”
Tess had not invited her family from Marlott.Angel had written to his.His brothers had not replied,and his parents wrote that they hoped he was not hurrying into marriage, but that he was old enough to decide for himself.Angel did not mind,because he was planning to introduce Tess to them as a d'Urberville as well as a dairymaid,some months later.	忽然妈妈提高声调：“她一定会发现——你不是不知道！戈德会告诉……”
When she had recovered a little,she asked, 'Is the door shut?' 'I don' t know.'	他怎么知道我是头一回？
She became worried when she realized the workers were still dancing wildly and would not be going home soon.Again she caught sight of Alec,waiting in a doorway,his cigar glowing red in the dark.Eventually she joined a group wandering home.They had all been drinking,but she felt safer with them than alone.But after a while she became involved in a quarrel with them,and was trying to get away from the angry group,when Alec d'Urberville rode by.He offered to take her home on the back of his horse.She hesitatedt,then accepted.	他用木棒使劲地打奥利弗的肩膀，当他再次举起手里的木棒时，南希扑了过去，夺下了木棒，扔进了炉火。
The police car was only a couple blocks away—heading in our direction.	爱丽丝说。
In three minutes I had the Hispaniola sailing easily before the wind,along the coast of Treasure Island.Then I went be-low and got a handkerchief and helped.Hands tie up the great bleeding wound in his leg.He ate a little and drank more of the rum,then he began to look a little better.	从窗户望去，约翰可以看见河以及河对面的树林和田野。
'Never…I think,'I said. 'Buff's too old.'	他感到舒适、愉快、安全。
Then Mom's voice escalated: "She'll find out—you know she'll find out! Gertrude will tell—"	“太迟了，他们把我俩都抓住了，”另一个声音叫道：“快逃吧，鲁帕特！”
Bodies surged forward, waving papers printed with raffles, the lamberts, stephen cho, mr. Johaanson, Turtle-dove Hostel, and Anne Milky written on them—but no Vassar Spore.	罗杰看看黛安娜，但什么也没说。
He hit O liver hard on the shoulders with the stick.	艾伯特上下摇晃着脑袋。
He was raising it for a second hit when Nancy rushed forward and, seizing the piece of wood, threw it into the fire.	“不舒服！她生气了，就这样，”他说。
'It's not polite to say things like that,'said Alice.	“莫利谈到钱总要生气。
From the window,John could see the river,and the woods and fields on the other side.	“先生，别再说过去这些了。”
He felt comfortable,happy,safe.	我说，擦去了不知不觉流出的眼泪。
For about ten or twelve days we sailed on south,down the coast of Africa.	1周后，公爵夫人回到法国。
Then one day we saw some people on the shore—strange,wild people,who did not look friendly. By now we had very little food,and We really needed help. we were afraid,but we had to go on shore.	在这以后的14年里，她独自一人住在巴黎，把自己锁在那所幽暗的大房子里，足不出户。
'Too late!They've got both of us! 'cried another voice. 'Save yourself,Rupert!'	“是的，”我回答道，“他不招人喜欢，我明白。”
Roger looked at Diane but said nothing.Albert moved his head slowly up and down.	门开了。
'Ill!She's angry,that's all,'he said. 'Molly always gets angry about money.Why can't she be good to her sister?Annie's going to die soon.Molly knows that.'	“喂！小伙子，”克雷先生开口道。
'Don't talk any more of the past,sir,' I said,wiping a secret tear from my eyes.	我们去了车站，那儿有其他的马车在等候旅客，我们站在了最后一辆车的后面。
A week later the Duchess returned to France,and for the next fourteen years she lived alone in Paris.The big house was dark.The doors were locked and she did not go out.	几个马车夫过来看我。
'I did,'I replied.	“谢谢你，汤姆森先生，那太好了。”
'He isn't well liked,I understand.'	律师走上前说。
The door opened.	“晚上好，鲍尔弗先生，”他礼貌地对这个老人说。
'Hallo,young man,'began Mr Clay.	还有，“晚上好，埃比尼泽叔叔，”我说。
We went to the cab stand where the other cabs were waiting for passengers,and took our place at the back of the last cab.Several of the other drivers came to look at me.	还有，“这真是一个重要的夜晚，鲍尔弗先生，”托伦斯补充道。
' Thankyou, Mr Thomson,that's excellent,' saidthe lawyer,stepping forward.	“她又喝醉了。”
'Good evening,Mr Balfour,'he said politely to the old man.And,'Good evening, uncle Ebenezer, ' said I.And,'It's a grand evening, Mr Balfour,' added Torrance.	费金想。
'She's been drinking again, 'thought Fagin.	在他关门时，她醒来了。
As he closed the door, she woke up.	他把盗窃失败的事跟她说了，她没吱声，头又歪在了桌子上。
He told her what had happened during the robbery; she said nothing and her head returned to the table. 'And where do you think the boy is now, my dear?	“亲爱的，你觉得这孩子现在会在哪儿？”费金问道，力图从她脸上看出点什么。
'Fagin asked her, trying hard to see her face. 'Poor little child!	“可怜的孩子！就这样被丢下不管了。”
Left alone like that.'	“我宁愿留在家里跟你和爸爸在一起。”苔丝看着窗外说。
Although it was night and she had a fifteen－mile walk, she felt quite safe.She was only worried about her mother, and did not notice the strange shapes of trees and hedges in the darkness.At three in the morning she passed the field where she had first seen Angel Clare,and felt again the disappointment when he did not dance with her.And when she saw the family cottage, it seemed to be part of her body and life,as it always did.	她只是担心她的母亲，根本注意不到黑暗中那些树木和篱笆怪异的影子。凌晨3点，她经过与安吉尔·克莱尔初次见面的田野，因他没有请她跳舞产生的失望又一次涌上心头。她看到她们家的房子，它就像她身体和生活的一部分。它总是这样的。
I began to think again about escape.	我又重新开始考虑逃离。
Perhaps Friday wanted to go home too.	也许星期五也想回家。
Perhaps together we could get to his country.	或许我们能一起回到他的国家。

As authors go,I am,as I told you,a rich man.But there are not many authors who make nearlyas much money as I do,and I do it because I amgood and because I work very hard.In the midst ofyour good time I want you to stop and think oncein a while about where the money comes from;notonly because it has come from my hard work,butbecause it is absolutely necessary for you yourselfto get some perspective on your own financialposition.When you have finished your educationyou are going to have to go to work,to earn asalary.I will be 59 in January,and it is just kiddingmyself to think that I can go on working this handand earning this kind of money,and I do not oftenkid myself.At 21 you will be coming into somemoney,but as I have often told you,it is not goingto be enough to make you Miss Richbitch or topermit you to live as Miss Richbitch.I am lettingyou have a good time now,because this is the timeto have it,when you are young.But I would bedoing you no favor if I failed to remind you of thehard realities.One of the hardest realities is moneyand the handling of it.Another is the fact that untilyou marry,and possibly even after,you are goingto be a working-girl I am very fond of most of yourfriends,but you must not get into the habit oftaking for granted that I am as rich as some oftheir fathers.I'm not.I have earned as much in oneyear as you will inherit from your mother's estate.And you will only get the income from your grandmother's trust fund;the principal is held intrust for your children.	如同我告诉你的，在作家中我是比较富有的。到一月份我就59岁了，要想我能继续如此勤奋工作，挣这么多的钱，简直是自欺欺人，我极少欺骗自己。你到21岁时，将能继承一笔钱，但正如我常常告诫你的，这笔钱并不足以使你成为富家小姐或过像富家小姐那样的生活。现在，我使你过着愉快的生活，因为你还小，正是享受快乐生活的时候。但是，如果我未能让你认识到这些严峻的现实，对你是没有任何好处的。而且，你只能得到你祖母的托管金的收入 部分，而本金是给你的子女的。

Then Harris tried to open the tin with a little knife,and he cut himself badly.George tried with some scissors.The scissors flew up,and nearly hit him in the eye.I tried to make a hole in the tin with the sharp end of a piece of metal.But I missed.As a result,I fell in the water,and the tin flew away and broke a cup.	哈里斯想用小刀开罐头，结果把自己狠狠划了一刀；乔治用剪刀试了试，结果剪刀飞了，差点扎到他的眼睛；我想用铁条的尖头在罐头上钻个小孔，可是没有对准，结果我摔进水里，罐头弹起来，砸碎了一只茶杯。

At the hunt he met several friends and neighbours,and be fore the hunt started he managed to sell Wildfire for a good price.The money would be paid when he brought the horse to the neighbour's house later that day.Dunstan knew it would be safer to take the horse there immediately,so that he could be sure of receiving the money.But he was confident that he could take care of Wildfire during the hunt,and so,after a glass or two of whisky,he joined the other riders in the fields.This time,however,he was not as lucky as usual,and horse and rid-er fell while jumping a gate.Dunstan got up,shaken but unhurt,but poor Wildfire's back was broken,and in a few mo－ments he died.	在狩猎会，邓斯坦遇到了几个朋友和邻居，在狩猎会开始前他已经把野火卖了个好价钱，说好晚些时候把马送到邻居家里再拿钱。但他相信自己在狩猎会上能照料好马。于是，喝了一两杯威士忌启，他加入了其他狩猎者的行列。不幸的是，这次邓斯坦没有平时幸运，在跳过一个篱笆门时，马和骑手都摔倒了。邓斯坦站了起来，摔得够呛但没伤着，而可怜的野火的背却摔断了，几分钟后，它死了。

Tess walked quickly past them,tears running down her face.She continued walking as fast as she could away from Emminster.How unlucky that she had met the sons and not the father!Angel's parents would have taken poor lonely Tess to their hearts immediately,as they did every other lost soul,without thought of family or education or wealth.	苔丝匆匆地超过了他们，泪水从她脸上潸潸滚下。她继续尽可能快地走着，离开了爱敏斯特。她是多么不走运啊，碰见的偏偏会是两个儿子，而不是父亲。安吉尔的父母会立即打心底里接受孤苦可怜的苔丝，就像他们对每一个迷失的人做的那样，而不会去考虑他的出身、学识或财富。
This time we did not argue.	这一次我们不争辩了。
We did not see any more soldiers, and our journey was easier now.	我们再没看见士兵，我们的旅途如今容易多了。
We walked through the warm summer nights, ate our porridge, drank our whisky, and slept in the dry heather in the daytime.Now that we were in the Lowlands, we were almost safe, and we both felt happy and hopeful.When we crossed the Forth River by boat from Limekilns, we were only five kilometres from Queensferry, where Mr Rankeillor lived.	温暖的夏夜我们行走，吃麦片粥，喝威士忌；白天则睡在干燥的石南丛中。既然我们处于苏格兰低地，那就几乎安全了，我们二人都感到高兴，心里充满了希望。当我们乘船从莱姆基恩渡过福斯河时，我们离昆斯费里，就是兰基勒先生居住的那儿，只有5公里路了。

'I would be glad to leave it,but I have nowhere else to go.'	“我很乐意离开这里，但是无处可去。”
So the four of us went on down the river, but Jim and I didn't like those two men.They were always getting drunk and making plans to get money out of people in every town.It's all right to take a chicken or something if you're hungry,but these men were really bad!	于是，我们四人顺流而下，可我和吉姆不喜欢那两个人。他们总是喝得醉醺醺的，并计划在每一个镇上从人们那里搞到钱。

Now the door was unlocked,and a voice from the darkness said,'Go into the kitchen and touch nothing.	门现在打开了，黑暗中有个声音说道：“到厨房来，不准碰任何东西。”
'I obeyed,while the man locked the heavy door carefully again.I found myself in the emptiest kitchen that I had ever seen.There was a fire,but no other light.On the table was a bowl of porridge and a glass of water,in front of the only chair.Around the walls were several locked chests.There was no other furniture.The man who now appeared in the kitchen was small,mean-looking and white-faced,between fifty and sev enty years old,and wearing a dirty old nightshirt.The worst thing about him was that he could neither take his eyes away from me,nor look straight into my face.	墙的四周摆放着几个锁着的柜子。除此以外，没有别的什么家具。现在在厨房里出现的那个男人身材矮小，形象猥琐，脸色苍白，约在五十岁到七十岁之间，穿着一件脏兮兮的旧睡衣。最糟糕的是他既不把视线从我身上移开，也不直视我的脸。
He looked surprised.	他看上去很惊讶。
'Why,what's the matter?'	“嗨，怎么回事？”
After much discussion Angel got down to details.He explained he had met a woman who was ideally suited to be a farmer's wife, who went to church reqularly, who was honest, sensitive, intelligent, graceful, pure as snow, and extremely beautiful.	商讨了好一阵之后，安吉尔开始细细阐述。他解释道，他遇上了一位非常适合做农场主妻子的姑娘，她经常去教堂，她真诚、聪慧、机智、可爱，雪一般地纯洁，而且极其美丽。

Monks opened a small door, saying impatiently, 'Come in!	蒙克斯打开一扇小门，不耐烦地说：“快进来！
Don't keep me waiting! '	别让我再等了！”
I was woken suddenly when my box was lifted high in the air.I can only suppose that a large bird took hold of the ring on top of the box with his talons,and flew away with it.Through the windows I could see the sky and clouds passing by,and I could hear the noise of the bird's wings.Then I was falling,so fast that I felt quite breathless.There was a loud crash,as the box fell into the sea.Perhaps the bird had been attacked by others,and so had to drop what he was carrying.	我的盒子被提到高空中，把我突然惊醒了。我只能猜测一只大鸟的爪子抓住了我盒子顶部的环，带着它飞走了。透过窗户我可以看见天空和云彩飞逝，我还可以听见鸟翅膀的声音。然后我往下跌，快得我觉得几乎透不过气。也许这鸟儿受到什么袭击，所以不得不丢下它抓的东西。
I was unhappy, and afraid, and I was pregnant again.They took me to Lochleven Castle, and put me in a room like a prison.There, I did not eat for two weeks, and Bothwell's children—there were two babies—wer born dead.I nearly died too—I was so angry and tired and ill. Then, one day after the babies died, Lord Lindsay gave me a letter.	我既伤心又害怕，那时候我又怀孕了。他们把我带到拉克利文城堡，并把我关进一间像监狱一样的房间里。在那里，我两个星期没有吃饭，并且怀着博思韦尔的孩子——两个婴儿——一出生就死了。我几乎也要死掉——我感到非常愤怒、非常疲惫，而且病得很重。
It said：	在两个婴儿死去的那一天，林德辛勋爵给了我一封信。信上写道：
Will was fifteen,and lived in Henley Street,he told me.His father was John Shakespeare,and he had a sister,Joan,and two younger brothers,Gilbert and Richard.There was another sister who died,I learnt later.And the next year he had another brother,little Edmund—the baby of the family.	威尔告诉我，他15岁，住在亨里街。家中有父亲约翰·莎士比亚，妹妹琼和两个弟弟，吉尔伯特和理查。我后来听说他另有一位姐姐死了。第二年他又添了一个弟弟——威尔家的赤子小埃德蒙。
'But I consider a man should try to discover a woman's feelings,not wait for her encouragement!	“可是我认为男人应当努力去发现女人的感情，而不是等待她的鼓励！
And Jane probably doesn't know what her real feelings for Bingley are yet—she has only seen him a few times,not often enough to understand his character, or be sure that she really loves him.'	而且简也许还不知道自己对彬格莱的真正感情是什么——她只见过他几次，还不足够了解他的性格，或者还不敢肯定自己爱他。”
In the thirteen days before my departure, my moods fluctuated.	但是劳蕾、丹妮、还有阿宝都相当开心。
One minute my heart thump-thumped in anticipation of the exotic adventure before me, and the next minute I was slammed with a wave of intense homesickness—though I hadn't so much as set one foot on the plane.	她们三人总是挺胸抬头从走廊上经过，带着神秘的表情，仿佛在合伙搞什么阴谋（确实有个阴谋来的……），有时还无缘无故的爆发出一阵笑声。
The hours dragged by wearily.By lunch time the situation was getting on their nerves.Naturally their thoughts underwent a subtle change.The gentlemen,even the ladies,found themselves asking the same question.Why should Boule de Suif be so particular on this occasion?What was her profession?Was it not her daily job to sell her body for money?	；（丹妮）“De inimico non loquaris sed cogites!”(“精神胜利法甭想赢了对手，计划才是正道！”) 劳蕾太淑女了，她不说狠话，而是用眯眼加撅嘴来摆出一副狠相——结果是副便秘相。
'It's spring now.You won't have any more cold weather.'	时间有气无力地缓慢挨过。中午时分，事态的发展愈加使他们坐卧不安。她每天不是靠卖身赚钱的吗？
'From you,sir!	“春天来了，天气不会再冷啦。”
'I could not stop myself,and burst into tears immediately.	“离你，先生。”我无法克制自己，眼泪一下子涌了出来。
Emily and Anne did know,of course.They had known about Charlotte's book for a long time.Jane Eyre was not the first book that Charlotte had sent to a publisher.Over a year ago she had written another book,The Professor, and sent it to one publisher after another.Each publisher had sent it back,in a packet addressed to Currer Bell.And then Charlotte had sent it, in the same old packet,to another publisher, and then another,and got it back again.	爱米丽和安妮当然知道，她们知道夏洛蒂写了这本书已经很长时间了。《简·爱》并不是夏洛蒂寄给出版商的第一部书。一年多以前她写过另一本书，名叫《教授》，寄给了一个又一个出版商。可是每次都被退了回来，包裹上写着柯勒·贝尔的名字。夏洛蒂又把包裹按原样寄出，结果还是一样。
'It's one of our stories,papa,'Charlotte said.	“这是我们的一个故事，爸爸。”
'We have to come in here to look at the picture.Then we invent what hap-pens.'	夏洛蒂说，“我们得来这儿看看它，这样才能把故事编出来。”
Lord Henry laughed.	亨利勋爵笑了。

Hanks reclined across the empty seat beside him, his cowboy hat covering his eyes.	虽然我对去遮蔽体的路了如指掌，但这次几乎是迷了路。
He wasn't like any of the boys I knew at the Seatttle Academy of Academic Excellence, that's for sure.	我接近遮蔽体时，看见一个人坐在地上，几乎睡着了。
The mist was so thick that I could not see anything.Al-though I knew my way to the shelter very well,I almost got lost this time.I was near it when I saw a man sitting on the ground,half asleep.I went up and touched his shoulder.He jumped up,and it was the wrong man!He was dressed in grey,too,and had an iron chain on his leg.He ran away into the mist.	我走过去，拍拍他的肩膀，他一跃而起。他不是我遇见的那个人！他也穿着灰布衣服，腿上也戴着一副脚镣。他逃跑到浓雾之中。

The room in the workhouse where the boys were fed was a large stone hall,and at one end the master and two women served the food.This consisted of a bowl of thin soup three times a day, with a piece of bread on Sundays.The boys ate everything and were always hungry.The bowls never needed washing.The boys polished them with their spoons until They shone.After three months of this slow starvation,one of the boys told the others he was so hungry that one night he might eat the boy who slept next to him.He had a wild hungry eye,and the other boys believed him.After a long discussion,They decided that one of them should ask for more food after supper that evening,and O liver was chosen.	济贫院里男孩子们吃饭的地方是一间有石板墙石板地的大屋子，在屋子的一头，管事的和两位女佣负责给孩子们打饭。这样缓慢的挨饿持续了三个月后，一天，一个男孩跟别的男孩子说他太饿了，没准哪天晚上他会吃了睡在他边上的人。他那饥饿得发狂的眼神让别的男孩无法不相信他的话。经过长时间的商量，他们决定必须有一个人在当天晚饭后，去请求多给点儿吃的。结果，奥利弗被选中了。

He told me why he had wanted to see me,and how he hoped to feel better now that I was with him.He had,he explained,a strange illness which had been in his family for a long time.It was a nervous illness which made him feel everything much more strongly than other people.He could only eat food that was almost tasteless.He had to choose his clothes very carefully because most of them hurt his skin.He could not have flowers in his room because their smell was too strong for him.Light hurt his eyes,and most sounds hurt his ears except the soft sound of guitars.	他向我讲述了他为何急于见到我，以及他如何希望现在有我相陪伴，他的情况会好转些。他解释道，他得的是一种怪病，这种病已经在他的家族中肆虐好久了。这种神经过敏症搞得他对一切事物都比其他人敏感得多。他只能吃那些几乎完全寡淡无味的食物，只能万分小心地挑选衣物，因为大多数面料都会伤害他的皮肤。他不能忍受屋里摆放花卉，因为花卉的香气对他来说太浓烈了。光线会刺伤他的眼睛，大部分声音会刺伤他的耳朵——只有柔和的吉他弹奏声他还能接受。
I smiled as I replied proudly,'Sir,you don't know much about European war.With our guns and bullets and gunpow－der we can destroy a thousand ships,a hundred cities,and twenty thousand men You see,—'	我笑着骄傲地回答，“先生，你不太了解欧洲的战争。用我们的枪、子弹和火药我们可以摧毁 1000只轮船，100座城池，2万人。你看——”

The next day Mr Gardiner travelled to London,as he had promised.Now began a painful period of waiting for those left at Longbourn.They became even more anxious,as news came from Meryton of Wickham's lies,debts,and secret attach- ments to most of the servant girls in the town.Everybody de- clared that he was the wickedest young man in the world,and protested that they had always distrusted his great charm and appearance of goodness.Although Elizabeth did not believe half of these stories,she believed enough to feel sure that her sister's reputation was already lost,and even Jane almost despaired of receiving good news.	现在，留在浪搏恩的人开始了痛苦难熬的等待时期。从麦里屯不断传来韦翰的消息：撒谎、欠债以及与镇上大多数年轻女仆之间的秘密恋情，这使他们更加焦虑。大家都说，他是世界上最邪恶的年轻人，并且宣称，他们一贯怀疑他的巨大魅力和堂堂仪表。虽然伊丽莎白认为这些传闻不能全信，但相信其中的一部分就足以使她认定妹妹的名声已经丧失殆尽，甚至简都不指望听到什么好消息了。
Catherine looked at her husband,half angry and half laughing.	凯瑟琳似怒似笑地看着她的丈夫。“不，”她说，“我不能坐到厨房里。
'No,'she said,'I can't sit in the kitchen.Ellen,bring two tables,one for your master and Miss Isabella,the other for Heathcliff and myself.We'll sit apart from them,as we're of a lower class!Will that please you,Edgar darling?Decide quickly!I must have him near me!'	艾伦，搬两张桌子，一张给你的主人和伊莎贝拉，另一张给希斯克利夫和我。我们不跟他们一起坐，因为我们层次低！这样你高兴了罢，亲爱的艾加？快拿主意！我必须让他离我近点！”

Although he recognized it as his own room,it looked very different now.The walls were covered with bright green leaves,and there was a good fire burning in the fireplace.On the floor were big plies of the best Christmas food—wonderful rich dark cakes,warm soft bread,colourful apples and oranges,plates of yellow butter,cooked chickens,boxes of chocolates and sugared sweets.Sitting beside all this was a large,smiling spirit,who called out cheerfully to Scrooge, 'Come in!Chme in,man!I am the ghost of Christmas Present!Look at me!'	尽管他认出这是他自己的房间，但它现在看上去已完全不同。墙壁被鲜亮的绿叶所覆盖，壁炉里燃烧着熊熊的火焰。地板上摆着大堆的上好的圣诞食品——味道浓郁的巧克力蛋糕、热乎乎松软的面包、五颜六色的苹果和桔子、一盘盘的黄油、炖好的鸡、一盒盒的巧克力和糖果。坐在这些东西旁边的是一个身材高大、面带笑容的幽灵，它高兴地对斯克罗吉高声喊，“请进！请进，伙计！

'suddenly the old woman was afraid.	突然，老妇人很害怕。
During dinner,the Countess happened to question the elder nun about the lives of the saints.She answered with unexpected eloquence that even the saints had suffered from the entanglements of sin,and that only by the constant exercise of reverence could they walk the paths of the Lord.	在饭桌上，伯爵夫人碰巧问到那位年长的修女，有关圣徒们的生活。出人意料地，她竟滔滔不绝地回答说，即使是圣徒也受到罪恶的缠结之苦，只有不断地向上帝表示崇敬，他们才可能走上见上帝之路。
'I only said that I was too young to do anything,and that I didn't wish to have secrets from you so he must speak to Father.I thanked him for his kindness and said I would be his friend,but nothing more,for a long time.	“我说我太年轻了，什么都不能做。我说我不希望对你保守秘密，所以他必须要对爸爸讲。我感谢他的好意，说我会成为他的朋友，但在很长时期内不会有更进一步的关系。”

1 The mysterious door	1 一扇神秘的门
Mr Utterson the lawyer was a quiet, serious man. Hewas shy with strangers and afraid of showing his feelings.	律师厄特森先生是个不爱说话、一本正经的人。
Among friends, however, his eyes shone with kindnessand goodness.And, although this goodness never found itsway into his conversation, it showed itself in his way of life.He did not allow himself many enjoyable things in life.	在陌生人面前，他非常腼腆，不爱流露自己的情感，可当着朋友，他的眼睛总闪烁着关心与真诚的光芒，虽然这种真与善在他说的话中不大找得到，可在他的待人处世中一点一滴都没有漏掉。
He ateand drank simply and, although he enjoyed the theatre,hehad not been to a play for twenty years.	在生活上，他从不放纵享乐，吃喝也很随意、简单；即使很喜欢看戏，他也有20年没有进过剧院了。
However, he wasgentler towards other men' s weaknesses,and was alwaysready to help rather than blame them.	可是，他对别人的缺点却是宽容得不能再宽容了，总是想着去帮助他们而不是责备他们。
As a lawyer, he was often the last good person that evil-doers met on their way toprison,or worse.	作为一名律师，他经常是罪犯走进监狱或者踏上黄泉之前见到的最后一个好人，这些人的心里会一直保留对他的温文尔雅和公正无私的记忆。
Mr Utterson's best friend was a distant cousin calledRichard Enfield,who was well known as a fun-loving 'manabout town'.Nobody could understand why they werefriends, as they were different from each other in every way.They often took long walks together,however, marchingthrough the streets of London in companionable silence.	这个人是城里出名的“爱热闹”，交际场里的老手。谁也搞不明白他们为何居然是朋友，他们可真有天壤之别。但他们却经常一起散步，一走就是好远，穿过伦敦的街道，安安静静地做着伴。
One of these walks used to take them down a narrow sidestreet in a busy part of London.	有一次，他们散步走到伦敦闹市区一条狭窄的背街上。
It was a clean, busy, friendlystreet with bright little shops and shiny doorknockers.	这条街干净、热闹，人们也和善，一家家亮亮堂堂的小商店，门环锃明透亮。
Nearthe end of this street, however, stood a dark, mysterious,windowless building.The door had neither bell nor knockerand looked dusty and uncared for.	但是就在街道的尽头，有一幢阴暗、神秘、没有窗户的楼房，门上既没有铃也没门环，还到处是灰，显然已好久没人打扫了。
Dirty children played fearlessly on the doorstep, and nobody ever opened the door todrive them away.	脏兮兮的孩子们在门口疯玩疯闹，也没人开门轰他们走。
One day,as Mr Enfield and his friend passed the building,Mr Enfield pointed to it. 'Have you ever noticed that place? 'he asked.	一天，他俩走过这幢房子，恩菲尔德指着问道：“你注意过那儿吗？
'It remindsme of a very strange story.'	它让我想起一个奇怪的故事。”
'Really?	“哦，是吗？”
'said Mr Utterson.	厄特森先生说，“给我讲讲。”
'Well,'began Enfield,'I was coming home about threeo'clock on a black winter morning,when suddenly I saw twopeople.The first was a short man who was walking along thestreet,and the second was a little girl who was running as fastas she could.	头一个是个矮个子，正沿着街边走，第二个是个小姑娘，跑得很急。两个人一下撞到了一起，小孩儿摔倒了。
Well,the two bumped into each other and thechild fell down.Then a terrible thing happened.The mancalmly walked all over the child's body with his heavy boots,and left her screaming on the ground.It was an inhuman thingto do.I ran after the man, caught him and fetched him back.There was already a small crowd around the screaming child.The man was perfectly cool, but he gave me a very evil look,which made me feel sick in my stomach.The child's familythen arrived, and also a doctor.	接着，可怕的事发生了，那个人穿着沉甸甸的靴子，冷冷地从孩子身上压了过去，小姑娘躺在地上尖叫着。做这种事真残忍。我从后面追上来，抓住那人，把他拽了回来，这时一小群人也围到了又哭又叫的孩子身边。那个人非常镇静，一脸漠然，还狠狠地瞪了我一眼，真是让我反胃。
The child had been sent tofetch the doctor for a sick neighbour,and was on her wayhome again.	孩子的家人这会儿也赶到了，还来了一个医生。原来小姑娘是去请医生给邻居家病人看病的，她正要回家。
'"The child is more frightened than hurt,"said thedoctor—and that, you would think, was the end of the story.But, you see,I had taken a violent dislike to the short man.So had the child's family—that was only natural.But the doctor, who seemed a quiet, kindly man, was also looking at ourprisoner with murder in his eyes.	“‘孩子与其说是伤着了不如说是吓着了。’医生是这么说的。你也许以为故事到这里就该结束了。可是你想，我对那个小个子十分厌恶，小姑娘的家人也一样——当然，这很正常，可连医生（他看上去那么和善、安静），也盯着那个罪犯看，好像恨不能把他给杀了。
'The doctor and I understood each other perfectly.Together we shouted at the man, and told him we would tell this story all over London so that his name would be hated.	“我和医生彼此心照不宣，都冲着那人大声指责，并声称要让整个伦敦都知道这事，让人人都唾弃他的名字。
'He looked back at us with a proud,blach look. "Nameyour price,"he said.	“他阴森森地瞪了我们一眼，还是一副不可一世的样子，‘开个价吧，’他说。
'We made him agree to a hundred pounds for the child' sfamily.	“我们让他答应付给孩子家100英镑。
With another black look, the man led us to that doorover there.He took out a key and let himself into thebuilding.Presently he came out and handed us ten pounds ingold and a cheque for ninety pounds from Coutts's Bank.	他又翻了我们一眼，把我们领到那边的那扇门口，掏出钥匙，进了楼。
Thename on the cheque was a well-known one.	不一会儿，他又出来了，递给我们10镑金币和一张康茨银行的支票，上面写着90英镑，支票上的名字是大家都很熟的人。
'"See here,"said the doctor doubtfully,"it isn't usual for aman to walk into an empty house at four in the morning andcome out with another man's cheque for nearly a hundredpounds."	“‘你看，’医生满腹怀疑地说，‘够奇怪的，早上4点，一个人走进一所空房子，然后又拿着另一个人签名的支票出来了，足足快100镑呢！’
'"Don't worry,"said the man with an ugly look,"I'll staywith you until the banks open,and change the change myself."	“‘放你的心吧，’一脸凶相的矮个子说，‘我和你们等着银行开门，看我自己兑钱好了。’
'So we all went off, the doctor and the prisoner and myself,and spent the rest of the night at my house.In the morningwe went together to the bank.	“我们离开那儿，医生、罪犯和我到我家挨过了后半夜。
Sure enough, the cheque wasgood, and the money was passed to the child's family.'	到了早上，我们一道去了银行，支票是真的，没问题，钱很快就转给小姑娘家了。”
'Well,well,'said Mr Utterson.	“哦，是这样，”厄特森先生说。
'Yes,'said Enfield,'it's a strange story.My prisoner wasclearly a hard, cruel man.	“是啊！”恩菲尔德说，“这事真怪。
But the man whose name was onthe cheque was well known all over London for his kind andgenerous acts.Why would a man like that give his cheque to acriminal?'	明明肇事者是个冷酷、残忍的家伙，可签支票的人却是伦敦有名善良、慷慨的人。这样的人怎么会把支票给一个罪犯呢？”
'And you don't know if the writer of the cheque lives inthat building?	“你们也不知道支票的主人是不是住在那幢房子里？”
'asked Mr Utterson.	厄特森先生问。
'I don't like to ask,'said his friend.	“我可不喜欢问，”他的朋友说，“根据我的经验，提太多的问题可没什么好的。
'In my experience,it's not a good idea to ask too many questions,in case the answers are ugly,violent ones.But I've studied the place alittle.It doesn't seem like a house.	万一得到的答案既令人厌恶又令人不安，那该如何是好？但我还是稍微研究了一下那个地方。
There's no other door,and the only person who uses that door is the man I've just described to you.There are three windows on the side of thehouse,which look down onto a small courtyard.The windowsare shut,but they're always clean.There's a chimney too,which is usually smoking.So somebody must live there.'	它看起来不像一所房子，没别的门，唯一使用那扇门的人就是我刚才和你讲的那个家伙。房子一侧有三扇窗户，可以看到下面的小院，窗户都关着，但一直干干净净的。
'Enfield,'he said,'you're right about not asking toomany questions.However,I want to ask the name of the manwho walked over the child.'	尽管如此，我还是想问问踩着孩子身体走过去的那个人叫什么。”
'Very well,' said Enfield. 'He told us his name wasHyde.'	“当然了！”恩菲尔德说，“他告诉我们他叫海德。”
'What does he look like?'	“他什么模样？”
'He's not easy to describe, although I remember him perfectly.He's a strange-looking man.He's short,but has astrong, heavy body.There's something wrong with his appearance,something ugly and unpleasing—no,somethinghateful.I disliked him at once.'	“这一下子可说不好，虽然我清清楚楚记得他长得什么样。他长得很怪，个子又矮，身体粗壮，他的相貌哪儿有点不对劲，让人感到丑陋，不舒服——不，是让人憎恶的那种。
'Are you sure he used a key? 'he asked.	厄特森先生想了好一会儿，问道：“你肯定他用了钥匙吗？”
'What do you mean?	“瞧你问的！”
'asked Enfield in surprise.	恩菲尔德一脸诧异的样子。
'I know it must seem strange,'said his friend. 'But yousee, if I don't ask you the name on the cheque, it's because Iknow it already…'	“我知道我这么问有点怪，”朋友说，“可你想，我并没问你支票上签的是谁的名字，因为我心里已经明白了……”
'Well, why didn't you tell me?	“那你怎么不早说呢？”
'said his friend rathercrossly. 'Anyway, he did have a key, and he still has it. Isaw him use it only a week ago.'	朋友不无恼怒地说，“甭管怎么说，那家伙的确有钥匙，上礼拜我还看见他开门来着。”
Mr Utterson looked at him thoughtfully,but said nothingmore.	厄特森先生心事重重地看了他一眼，但没再多说什么。
2 In search of Mr Hyde	2 寻找海德先生
After dinner that evening Mr Utterson went into his office and unlocked a cupboard. He took out an envelope.It contained the will of Doctor Henry Jekyll,and was writtenin the doctor's own handwriting.	那天晚上，吃了饭，厄特森先生走进自己的办公室，打开柜橱上的锁，拿出一个信封，里面装的是亨利·杰基尔博士的遗嘱，是立书人亲笔写的。
'If I die,or if I disappear for more than three months,'thewill began,'I wish to leave everything I own to my dearfriend Edward Hyde.'	“如果我死了，或者三个月不见踪影，”遗嘱上写道，“我希望把所有一切留给我亲爱的朋友——爱德华·海德。”
This will had both worried and annoyed Mr Utterson.	这份遗嘱让厄特森先生坐立不安。
To alawyer it was an unusual and dangerous kind of will.	作为一名律师，他觉得这样的遗嘱既少见又危险。
It wasbad enough when Edward Hyde was only an unknown name,but now that the lawyer knew something about Hyde, the willworried him more than ever.	直到今天以前，他对这个爱德华·海德一无所知，这就够糟的了。
It had seemed like madness before;now it began to seem shameful.	可现在知道了一些有关海德的事情，遗嘱就更让他生气了。
With a heavy heart MrUtterson replaced the envelope in the cupboard,put on hiscoat and went to see his old friend Doctor Lanyon.	如果说以前这一切看起来是疯狂的，那么现在这个名字就是令人发指的。厄特森先生心事重重地把文件放进柜子里，穿上大衣，去找他的老朋友兰宁医生。
Doctor Lanyon was enjoying his after-dinner coffee.	兰宁医生正在品着饭后的咖啡。
'Comein,old friend!'	老朋友，快进来！”
he cried.	他大声嚷着。
The two men had known each othersince their school days.They sat for several minutes,drinkingcoffee and talking companionably of this and that. At last MrUtterson mentioned the thoughts that were worrying him.	他们俩从上学的时候起就认识。俩人坐在一起，一边喝咖啡，一边闲扯着，最后厄特森先生谈起了自己心中的不安。
'I suppose,Lanyon,'he said,'that you and I are HenryJekyll's oldest friends?'	“我想，兰宁，”他说，“你我应该是亨利·杰基尔最老的朋友了吧？”
'I suppose so,'said Doctor Lanyon,'but I don't often seehim now.'	“我想是吧，”兰宁医生说，“不过，我最近不常见他了。”
'Really?' 'I thought you andhe were interested in the same things.'	“哦，是吗？”
'But morethan ten years ago Henry Jekyll became too—well,imaginativefor me.	“曾经有过，”医生接着说，“不过，那是十多年前了。
He developed some strange,wild, unscientific ideas.	那以后，亨利·杰基尔变得——嗯，对我来讲太不可思议了。
Itold him so,and I've seen very little of him since then.'	他脑子里装了一些奇怪、荒唐、不科学的想法，我就是这么和他说的，从那以后，我就很少见到他了。”
Mr Utterson looked at his friend's red, angry face. 'Only adisagreement about some scientific question,'he thought. 'It's nothing worse than that.'	厄特森先生看着朋友气呼呼、涨红的脸，心想：“只不过是科学见解上的分歧，并没有什么大不了的。”
Calmly he continued,'Didyou ever meet a friend of Jekyll's a man called Hyde?'	他不动声色地又问：“你有没有见过杰基尔的一个朋友——一个叫海德的朋友？”
'Hyde?	“海德？”
'No, never.'	医生重复道，“没有，从来没有。”
Soon the lawyer said goodnight and went home to bed,where he lay awake for a long time thinking about Enfield's description of Hyde,and Doctor Jekyll's will.When at last hefell asleep,he was troubled by dreams.	不一会儿，律师道了晚安，回家睡觉，可他躺在床上好长时间还想着恩菲尔德说的海德的样子，还有杰基尔博士的遗嘱。
In his mind's eye hesaw a faceless man marching over the child's body.Then hesaw his old friend Jekyll in bed,while the same faceless figurestood over him.The facelessness of that figure worried himdeeply.	好不容易睡着了，可是一个梦接着一个梦，让他心绪不宁。梦里仿佛看见一个没有脸的人重重踩过孩子的身体，又看见老朋友杰基尔躺在床上，那个没有脸的人站在他身上。那个没有脸的人着实让他担心。
'Very well,Mr Hyde,'said the lawyer to himself,'I willfind you,and I will see your face for myself.'	“走着瞧，海德先生，”律师自言自语地说，“我一定要找到你，亲眼看看你的模样。”
During the next few weeks Mr Utterson spent many hoursin the narrow street where Enfield had seen Hyde.He waitedpatiently near the mysterious door, hoping for a sight of MrHyde—and one dry, clear winter night he was successful.The street was empty and silent and small sounds carried along way.The lawyer heard footsteps.	以后的好几个星期，厄特森先生在恩菲尔德看见海德的那条背街上徘徊了好久。他在那扇神秘的门旁耐心等着，希望能发现海德先生的踪迹。终于，一个清冷的冬夜他遇上了海德。
He stepped back intothe shadows and waited.A short figure turned the corner andwalked towards the mysterious door.	那天晚上，街道空荡荡的，寂静无声，一点响动声都能传出去好远，律师突然听见了脚步声。他躲在阴暗处，等着。
Although Mr Uttersoncould not see his face, he felt a strong, almost violent, dislikefor the stranger.	一个小个子男人转过街角，朝那扇神秘的门走去。
'Mr Hyde?'	厄特森先生紧走几步，轻轻拍了拍那人的肩膀：“是海德先生吧？”
'Yes,that's my name,'said the stranger coolly.' What doyou want?'	“正是，”陌生人冷冰冰地说，“你想怎么样？”
'I see that you're going in.I'm an old friend of DoctorJekyll's.My name is Utterson.You must have heard myname—may I come in with you?'	“我看见您正要进门。我是杰基尔博士的好朋友，叫厄特森，您一定听他提过我，我能和您一起进去吗？”
'Doctor Jekyll is not at home,'replied Mr Hyde.	“杰基尔博士这会儿不在家，”海德回答说。
'How didyou know me? 'he added sharply.	突然他机容地问道：“你怎么知道我的名字？”
'First let me see your face,'replied the lawyer.	“先让我看看您的脸再说，”律师回答道。

Accreditation and certification standards:  These standards are for accreditation applicants and certification applicants alike.	认证与认可标准：这些标准针对的是申请进行认证和认可的机构。
In the case of certification, an education program is not required, nor are standards directly related to the presence of the visiting public.	申请认可时，不需要具有教育项目，各项标准与公众到场亦不直接相关。
